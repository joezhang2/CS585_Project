Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Michael Gallant 508-293-6357 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE gallant_michael@emc.com ----------------------- EMC REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS REVENUE UP 18% SEQUENTIALLY ON STRONG CUSTOMER DEMAND, MARKET SHARE GAINS FOR CLARiiON CX SYSTEMS, INFORMATION STORAGE SOFTWARE HOPKINTON, Mass. - January 23, 2003 - EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported fourth quarter and full fiscal year results for 2002. The results included an 18% sequential revenue increase in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2002, led by strong customer demand for the new CLARiiON CX family of mid-tier networked storage systems and for EMC's industry-leading portfolio of information storage software products. Total consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.49 billion, 18% higher than the $1.26 billion reported in the third quarter of 2002, and 2% lower than the $1.51 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net loss for the fourth quarter, including an after-tax restructuring and other special charge of $117 million, was $64 million or $.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $70 million or $.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2002, excluding the aforementioned $117 million charge, was $53 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Total consolidated revenue for the full 2002 fiscal year was $5.44 billion, compared with $7.09 billion for the full 2001 fiscal year. Net loss for the full 2002 fiscal year was $119 million or $.05 per share, compared with a net loss of $508 million or $.23 per share for the full 2001 fiscal year. Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "We finished 2002 on a very strong note as our automated networked storage strategy began to pay off. Each of our major businesses -information storage systems, software and services - achieved double-digit sequential revenue growth. It's clear we gained market share, particularly in mid-tier storage and storage software. We are now approaching customers with our strongest and most complete product line ever, a lower cost structure, and a significantly improved go-to-market model. We expect to gain market share in all of our strategic segments and grow profitably throughout 2003." EMC's fourth-quarter results were marked by success in several strategic areas. Revenue from EMC's mid-tier CLARiiON products experienced strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2002. Revenue from information storage software grew 22% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2002. EMC Centera Content Addressed Storage systems, introduced in April 2002, significantly exceeded fourth-quarter
revenue expectations, with well over one petabyte (1,000 terabytes) of Content Addressed Storage shipped during the quarter. Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The balanced sequential revenue growth we achieved was encouraging. Healthy customer demand for our automated networked storage solutions helped increase our overall product volume, leading to a significant improvement in gross margins. Throughout 2002, we focused on controlling the controllable. Since we intensified our attack on costs six quarters ago, we have achieved an annualized cost savings rate of more than $1.25 billion, resulting in a quarterly break-even level of about $1.37 billion. In addition, we continued to strengthen the balance sheet during the year. Absent the $364 million we spent repurchasing our shares, cash and investments would have increased $966 million during 2002. We ended the year with cash and investments of $5.7 billion, or approximately 60% of total assets." During the fourth quarter, EMC continued its most aggressive series of product roll-outs ever by delivering two new members of the powerful CLARiiON CX family of mid-tier networked storage systems; combining the functionality and availability found in EMC's high-end NAS solutions with the cost advantages of CLARiiON into the EMC Celerra NS600; and providing customers with NAS software solutions that enable organizations to centrally manage and automate the movement of files and data across geographically dispersed locations with new EMC OnCourse software. EMC also expanded its alliance with Dell and jointly teamed with Microsoft to develop the largest Microsoft SQL Server(TM) storage area network (SAN) ever built; unveiled major advances in its WideSky Developers Suite; and outlined plans to drive standards-compliant, open storage management solutions into real-world environments. EMC products, services and people were recognized during the fourth quarter for innovation, market leadership, and historic contributions. The readers of INTELLIGENT ENTERPRISE MAGAZINE selected EMC ControlCenter as the world's best family of storage management software in the publication's annual "Intelligent Enterprise Reader's Choice Awards"; EMC Centera was named "Product of the Year" by the content collaboration magazine TRANSFORM MAGAZINE, and received "Best of Show" honors at the BioIT WORLD CONFERENCE & EXPO; EMC won the Software Technical Assistance Recognition (STAR) award for outstanding mission-critical support for the second year in a row; and EMC Executive Chairman Mike Ruettgers was inducted into the IT INDUSTRY HALL OF FAME for transforming and revolutionizing the way businesses access, manage, share and protect digital information. BUSINESS OUTLOOK - ---------------- THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ANY MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES OR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT MAY BE COMPLETED AFTER THE DATE HEREOF. o Revenue in the first quarter of 2003 is expected to be between $1.35 billion and $1.4 billion. o Excluding any restructuring charges, earnings per share in the first quarter of 2003 is expected to be, at best, $.01 per diluted share. o Additional improvements in the overall cost structure are expected during 2003, resulting in an expected break-even level under $1.3 billion by the end of Q2 of 2003.
o Excluding any restructuring charges, EMC expects to report net income for each quarter in 2003. o EMC expects continued improvement in gross margins and operating margins during 2003, although quarterly margins may vary during the year based on volume. o R&D investment for 2003 is expected to be slightly lower than the $781 million invested in 2002, as additional efficiencies are gained. o Capital spending for 2003 is expected to be approximately the same to slightly down compared with the $391 million spent in 2002. o The tax rate for 2003 is expected to be approximately 30%.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 16, 2003  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2003. The results reflect strong customer adoption of EMC's broad portfolio of automated networked storage solutions.
 
Total consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.38 billion, 6% higher than the $1.30 billion reported in the first quarter of 2002. Net income for the first quarter was $35 million or $.02 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $77 million or $.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2002.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "The product innovation engine at EMC is running in overdrive. We continue to earn the confidence of new and existing customers by delivering market-leading price/performance through the broadest portfolio of storage platforms, software and services in EMC's history. As a result, I believe we again gained market share during the first quarter."
 
EMC's first-quarter results were marked by encouraging performance in several strategic areas. Revenue from EMC's new Symmetrix DMX series of high-end networked storage systems, introduced on February 3, 2003, accounted for more than half of total Symmetrix systems sales. Revenue from EMC's CLARiiON CX series of networked storage systems and software, introduced in the third quarter of 2002, continued to achieve strong growth. Revenue from information storage software grew 6% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2002. Revenue from information storage services grew 28% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2002. EMC Centera Content Addressed Storage (CAS) systems, introduced a year ago, continue to be EMC's fastest-growing major product line. EMC shipped more than two petabytes (2,000 terabytes) of Centera systems in the first quarter.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "We achieved significant improvement in our profitability due to the popularity of our new line of storage platforms, including the Symmetrix DMX and CLARiiON CX series, growth in storage services revenue, and a lowered cost structure. Over the past seven quarters, we have reduced our revenue break-even point by more than $2 billion on an annualized basis. During the first quarter, our continued attack on costs and improved margins enabled us to reach our targeted break-even level a full quarter ahead of schedule. With cash and investments at approximately $5.7 billion and virtually no debt, we have a solid financial foundation."
 
For details on some of the many customers who chose to implement EMC Automated Networked Storage solutions during the first quarter, please see EMC's separate customer news release issued today.
 
Besides the introduction of Symmetrix DMX and its record-breaking new Direct Matrix Architecture, other highlights of the first quarter included the introduction of the Symmetrix z8000 and CLARiiON with ATA networked storage systems; the introduction of EMC SAN Copy, enabling customers to centrally manage the movement and replication of data between current and legacy EMC CLARiiON and Symmetrix systems; and the broadening of EMC's market reach through new and enhanced partner and channel relationships with Oracle, Lockheed Martin, GE Medical, Eastman Kodak, Iron Mountain and KVS Inc. Also during the quarter, EMC settled all pending patent infringement litigation with Hitachi and Hitachi Data Systems (HDS) and agreed to exchange application programming interfaces (APIs) with Hitachi, HDS and Veritas Software.
 
EMC Automated Networked Storage solutions have been recognized repeatedly since the start of the year for innovation and market leadership. EMC was the only company to achieve "leader" status in both the SAN and NAS markets in META Group's recently released METAspectrum
SM
. New market data released by IDC found that EMC gained market share in the fourth quarter of 2002 to finish the year as the revenue leader in both the networked storage (Open SAN + NAS) and External RAID systems markets. Analysts at Gartner Dataquest confirmed that EMC was the world's leading supplier of storage management software in 2002, for the fourth straight year.
 
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof.

Conversion of Capital Stock
 
(a). Subject to this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted
Company Common Stock
 
into the right to receive 0.9 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), payable upon the surrender of the Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or having a record date) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
 
(b). All shares of Company Common Stock that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership), (B) such party or any Subsidiary of such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding equity or voting securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary of such party has the right to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization.

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d). Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.10 hereof. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP (as defined below) shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 5.4 hereof.

SECTION 2.2    
Exchange of Certificates.
 
(a). Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a
Exchange Agent
 
bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, stock certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. From time to time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to make all cash payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
 
(b). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (C) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), after giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable law, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Exchange Procedures
 
(c)No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock for which the record date is after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive until
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent Shares
.
 
such holder surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.
 
(d). No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of Parent Common Stock at the 4:00 p.m., New York City time, end of regular trading hours on the New York Stock Exchange during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.
No Fractional Shares
 
(e). If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or have established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
Transfers of Ownership
 
(f). At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Parent Common Stock which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar law) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar law following the passage of time specified therein.
Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability
 
(g). Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to
Withholding Rights
 
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.
 
(h) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock
.
 
(i) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a) as well as the other Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II; provided, howeverthat Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

(j). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

(c) The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents) to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from taking any action or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; , , that except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.2 or in connection with the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.

Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan
 
(a) To the maximum extent permitted under Parent's employee benefit plans, the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary who continue in employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") shall be eligible to participate, upon the same terms and conditions, in the various employee benefit plans which Parent or its affiliates maintain for their respective employees. In furtherance thereof, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee benefit plans of Parent or its affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan). From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company) under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which evidence of payment is provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, Parent and its Subsidiaries agree to honor in accordance with their terms and not contest any and all benefits accrued or vested as of the Effective Time, or otherwise contingent in whole or in part upon the occurrence of one or more transactions contemplated by this Agreement, under any employee benefit plan or agreement of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed in Section 3.24 of the Disclosure Schedule, including, without limitation, any rights or benefits arising under any such plan or agreement as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event, including termination of employment or service); it being understood that for purposes of any such plan or agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute, or will be deemed to constitute, both a "change of control" and a "corporate transaction".
 
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
 
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect as of the Effective Time such actions relating to the Legato Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including without limitation, terminating the 401(k) Plan, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any successor plan.
 
(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event within thirty (30) days thereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the outstanding Company Stock Options assumed under Section 6.10(a) for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available. The Company shall cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. Parent shall use its best efforts to maintain such Form S-8 registration statement in effect until all the Company Stock Options are either exercised or expire.
 
SECTION 6.10    .
Stock Plans
 
(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, and the Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP) themselves, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were applicable under the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the same number of shares of Parent Common Stock as the holder of the Company Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Option in accordance with the foregoing. Such Company Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section after giving effect to the Merger). It is the intention of the parties that the options so assumed by Parent hereunder qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event within thirty (30) days thereof, Parent shall make available to each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of a Company Stock Option assumed hereunder information evidencing the assumption of such option by Parent.
 
(b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of any Company Stock Plan or any Company Stock Option, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect to the provisions of Section 6.10(a).
 
SECTION 6.11    . The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Company's material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases in connection with the Merger, including without limitation each of the consents listed in Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule or required to prevent the occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect prior to the Effective Time or after the Effective Time.
Consents
 
SECTION 6.12

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of litigation expenses and limitation of personal liability existing in favor of the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the provisions existing on the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter or Company By-Laws shall, with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), survive the Effective Time, and, as of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all obligations of the Company in respect thereof as to any claim or claims asserted prior to or within a six-year period immediately after the Effective Time.
 
(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company) only with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; , , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.12(b) more than an aggregate amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Maximum Amount") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be approximately $1,125,000 in the aggregate). If the amount of the aggregate annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation during such six-year period shall maintain or procure as much coverage as possible for aggregate annual premiums not to exceed the Maximum Amount.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass. and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 8, 2003  EMC Corporation and LEGATO Systems, Inc., today announced a definitive agreement for EMC to acquire LEGATO, in a stock transaction valued at approximately $1.3 billion, extending EMC's technology and market leadership in storage software. The addition of LEGATO's strengths in heterogeneous information protection and recovery, HSM (hierarchical storage management), automated availability, and email and content management will expand EMC's market-leading portfolio of open storage software, making it easier for customers to access, manage and protect all of their information. This move underscores EMC's commitment to open, heterogeneous storage management, expands EMC's capabilities around information access and recovery, and deepens EMC's unparalleled storage management expertise and customer service and support.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "This combination is all about improving the access, management and protection of an organization's core asset  information  through its complete lifecycle. We're combining best-of-breed storage technology, two winning employee populations with similar reputations for customer focus, and two experienced management teams with highly complementary visions for the future of information management. This represents a significant win for both companies' customers, employees, partners and stockholders, accelerating the evolution of EMC as the company that offers the most comprehensive, open and integrated information storage solutions."
 
The acquisition will accelerate EMC's ability to deliver the industry's most complete information lifecycle management solutions, helping customers get the maximum value from their information at the lowest total cost at every point in the information lifecycle. Further, LEGATO's software-focused sales expertise, extensive channel partner relationships, and strong service capabilities will complement EMC's distribution strategy and enhance its ability to serve customers of all sizes around the globe.
 
David B. Wright, LEGATO's Chairman and CEO said, "LEGATO's current shareholders, employees, customers, and partners will see tremendous benefits from EMC's extensive R&D resources, expertise in networked storage, global distribution and customer reach, and overall financial strength. We will now have additional resources to further accelerate the development and delivery of solutions to the market in order to fulfill our mission of delivering the software and services that protect and manage customer's information, assure the availability of their applications and provide immediate access to business-critical information. This begins the next chapter for LEGATO as we expand our capabilities and continue our legacy of innovation."
 
Under terms of the agreement, LEGATO stockholders will receive 0.9 of a share of EMC common stock for each share of LEGATO common stock. Based upon the EMC closing stock price of $11.74 on July 7, 2003, the transaction is valued at approximately $1.3 billion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including LEGATO's stockholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2003. When completed, EMC expects to
take an expense charge in the quarter the transaction is closed for the value of LEGATO's in-process research and development costs. EMC expects to report a net profit in each quarter in 2003 and expects the transaction to be slightly accretive to fully diluted earnings per share in 2004.
 
Upon completion of the acquisition, EMC intends to operate LEGATO as a software division of EMC headquartered in Mountain View, California, led by David B. Wright, LEGATO's current Chairman and CEO. LEGATO's sales, marketing and service will remain focused on selling and servicing LEGATO's full line of products and solutions. EMC and LEGATO will integrate engineering and development functions to accelerate the development and delivery of comprehensive storage management solutions for high growth markets such as email management and HSM/archiving.
 
EMC President and CEO, Joe Tucci, LEGATO Systems, Chairman and CEO, David B. Wright and EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Teuber, will discuss the acquisition on a conference call for financial analysts, investors and the media at 8:30 a.m. EDT, today. The dial-in numbers are (888) 790-1750 (domestic) or (210) 234-8670 (international). The pass code to access the call is EMC. For the general public, the call will be webcast with supporting slides at EMC and LEGATO's homepages, and .

Date: July 16, 2003
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 16, 2003  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2003, reflecting strong customer adoption of EMC's information storage solutions in a challenging IT spending environment.
 
Total consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $1.48 billion, 7% higher than the $1.39 billion reported for the second quarter of 2002. Net income for the second quarter was $82 million or $.04 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1 million or $.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2002.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "The two words that best describe EMC's second-quarter performance are solid and balanced. Our automated networked storage strategy and strong execution are producing good results across all major segments of our business. We are experiencing the benefits of a completely refreshed product portfolio, broadened services offerings and an expanded distribution network. All signs point to additional EMC market share gains during the second quarter and we expect that to continue through the remainder of 2003."
 
EMC's second-quarter results were marked by sequential growth across all major segments of the business. Total information storage systems revenue, including EMC's new Symmetrix DMX, CLARiiON CX and Centera networked information storage systems, grew 7% sequentially compared with the first quarter of 2003. Revenue from the new, highly acclaimed Symmetrix DMX series of high-end networked storage systems accelerated sharply and accounted for approximately 80% of total Symmetrix systems sales in the second quarter. Revenue from EMC's industry-leading CLARiiON CX series again grew sequentially. Enthusiastic customer adoption of serial ATA technology, available on both CLARiiON and Centera systems, resulted in nearly 4.5 petabytes of ATA-based EMC storage shipped during the second quarter.
 
Total information storage software revenue grew 8% sequentially compared with the first quarter of 2003. Revenue from EMC's open multi-platform software, which includes products developed under the AutoIS open software strategy, grew 11% sequentially compared with the first quarter of 2003, driven by demand for the EMC ControlCenter family of storage management software. Total information storage services revenue grew 7% sequentially, led by an increase in software maintenance and support and continued demand for EMC's storage-focused professional services.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our newly introduced products, broadened distribution channels, storage services offerings, and a
much leaner cost structure have all contributed to a significant improvement in our profitability over the last 12 months. With cash and investments growing by $385 million during the quarter, reaching approximately $6.1 billion and virtually no debt, we have significant resources for the future."
 
In addition to broad customer acceptance of EMC's recently introduced products, highlights of the second quarter included a groundbreaking new version of EMC's popular PowerPath software, including the addition of integrated volume management, multi-vendor array support, and application availability features such as non-disruptive upgrades; the introduction of EMC Centera Compliance Edition, a specialized content addressed storage solution specifically designed to meet and exceed today's strictest records retention regulations; additions to the EMC ControlCenter family of storage management software including new online access and subscription-based software, SAN Architect and AutoAdvice; the announcement of the EMC NetWin 200, the first in a new family of Windows Storage Server products; new and/or enhanced alliances with Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu Siemens, Microsoft, and MTI; a new multi-tiered channel partner program to strengthen EMC's ties with the world's leading storage resellers; and the acquisition of Astrum Software Corporation, a privately held supplier of storage resource management (SRM) software for multi-platform, mid-tier storage environments.
 
Also during the quarter, EMC Automated Networked Storage continued to be recognized for innovation and market leadership. The new CLARiiON CX series of networked storage systems received the MVP (Most Valuable Product) award at the 2003 Storage World Conference. New Gartner findings also confirmed that EMC was the world's #1 storage systems and storage management software provider in 2002.*

the GCL. Section 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.

Section 1.5 BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. At and after the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub By-Laws"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the GCL, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Documentum, Inc." Section 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law.

The date on which the Closing shall occur is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." ARTICLE II CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by 2
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or any capital stock of Merger Sub: (a) COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)), together with each associated "Right" (as defined in the Rights Agreement, dated as of February 3, 1999, between the Company and BankBoston, N.A., as rights agent (the "Company Rights Agreement")), shall be converted into the right to receive 2.175 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), payable upon the surrender of the Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or having a record date) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. All shares of Company Common Stock, together with each associated "Right," that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership), (B) such party or any Subsidiary of such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding equity or voting securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary of such party has the right to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization. (c) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving 3
Corporation. (d) STOCK OPTIONS. Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated in the manner set forth in Sections 5.4 and 6.10 hereof. (e) COMPANY CONVERTIBLE DEBT. The outstanding debt of the Company convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Company Convertible Debt") pursuant to the terms of the Indenture dated as of April 5, 2002 between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company (the "Indenture") shall become convertible into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company Convertible Debt had been converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such actions required under the Indenture, in each case as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Indenture. Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, stock certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. From time to time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to make all cash payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d). (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (C) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such 4
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), after giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable law, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED PARENT SHARES. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock for which the record date is after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive until such holder surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of Parent Common Stock at the 4:00 p.m., New York City time, end of regular trading hours on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") during the five consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time. (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent 5
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or have established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND; NO LIABILITY. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Parent Common Stock which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar law) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar law following the passage of time specified therein. (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. (h) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY STOCK. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (i) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a) as well as the other Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against 6
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Section 2.3 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

or (ii) materially adversely affects the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no change, effect or circumstance resulting solely from any of the following shall be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor shall it be taken into consideration when determining whether there has occurred a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (A) general market, economic or political conditions affecting the industries in which Parent participates, provided that such change, effect or circumstance does not have a substantially disproportionate impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the pendency or announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) any litigation brought or threatened by stockholders of Parent (whether on behalf of Parent or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with the announcement of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; (D) any decrease in the market price or trading volume of Parent's publicly traded common stock; (E) Parent's failure to meet published industry analyst expectations; or (F) any change in applicable accounting requirements or principles, or applicable laws, rules or regulations which occurs or becomes effective after the date of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect 41
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, or 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the acquisition of 25% or more of any class of equity securities or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as set forth in this Section 6.2, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company's Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger (any such withdrawal, amendment, modification or proposal, a "Change of Recommendation"); (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in and consistent with the provisions of Section 6.2(a)); or (iii) except as set forth in this Section 6.2 adopt, approve or recommend to its stockholders that they accept, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.2, effect a Change of Recommendation or in the case of a tender or exchange offer made directly to its stockholders, recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer, if (A) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal; (B) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, but only at a time that is prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and is after the third business day following Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Company's Board of Directors desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such 42
Superior Proposal; or (C) the Company shall have complied with this Section 6.2 and shall not have breached in any material respect of the provisions set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) (provided, that in the case of a tender or exchange offer made directly to its stockholders the Company may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer) of the first sentence of this Section 6.2(b), or (B) affect any obligation of the Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the Company's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, regardless of whether the Company's Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation.

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Merger, to have a reasonable likelihood of closing, and for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being, and likely to be, obtained on the proposed terms by such third party. (c) The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall cause and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and shall direct its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents) to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. The Company shall inform Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) of all material developments and the status of any Acquisition Proposal, any negotiations or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in 43
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity that, to the Company's knowledge, is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all documents received from (to the extent such documentation sets forth the terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) or delivered or sent to any person or entity that is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent. (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from taking any action or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so under applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.2, neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal. Section 6.3 PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS; REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

Each of Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.

Section 6.7 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. 46
(a) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the written advice of counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or The Nasdaq National Market if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party prior thereto and provided, further, that, following a Change of Recommendation, no such consultation or agreement shall be required. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties (and each employee, representative or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant to the tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby beginning on the earliest of (i) the date of the public announcement by the parties of discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the date of public announcement by the parties of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) the date of the execution of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this Section 6.7(b) shall permit either party (or any employee, representative or agent thereof) to disclose (A) any information that is not necessary to understand the tax treatment and tax structure of such transactions (including the identity of the parties and any information that could lead another to determine the identity of the parties), or (B) any other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a violation of any applicable law. Section 6.8 LISTING OF PARENT SHARES. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have authorized for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Section 6.9 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; 401(k) PLAN. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation) of Parent or its affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide Company Employees for so long as such Company Employees remain so employed, health and welfare benefits (i) pursuant to the Company's or its Subsidiaries' employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements as provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and benefits which (in the case of this clause (ii)) are no less favorable than those 47
provided to employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by Company Employees with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company) under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which evidence of payment is provided to Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the benefits described in Section 6.9 of the Disclosure Schedule to the Company Employees, in each instance in accordance with Section 6.9 of the Disclosure Schedule. (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect such actions relating to the Documentum, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate (after reasonable consultation with the Company), including terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any successor plan. (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event within five days thereof (to the extent Parent has received copies of the relevant Company Stock Plans within a reasonable time period prior thereto), Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the outstanding Company Stock Options assumed under Section 6.10(a). Parent shall maintain such Form S-8 registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein) in effect for as long as all the Company Stock Options remain outstanding. (d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and continue in full force and effect the Company's Change of Control Retention Plan. Section 6.10 STOCK PLANS. (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted in accordance with its terms into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were applicable under the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a price per share equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio 48
(with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that the Company Stock Options which qualify as incentive stock options (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten business days thereafter), Parent will deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices regarding options held under Company Option Plans and the effect of this Section 6.10. (b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of any Company Stock Plan or any Company Stock Option, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect to the provisions of Section 6.10(a). (c) If the Closing Date occurs on or after January 1, 2004 but prior to March 1, 2004, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to create a special offering period under the Parent's Employee Stock Purchase Plan so that the Company Employees who become employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries can participate in such plan within ten business days from the Closing Date. Section 6.11 CONSENTS. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Company's material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases in connection with the Merger required to prevent the occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect prior to the Effective Time or after the Effective Time. Section 6.12 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with the written consent of Parent) or liabilities arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time, that are based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary. This Section 6.12(a) shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have under any agreement with the Company or under the Company's Charters or By-Laws as presently in effect. (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the 49
Company and its directors and officers in effect prior to the date of this Agreement (or indemnification agreements in the Company's customary form as of the date hereof for directors joining the Company's Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time) and any indemnification provisions under the Company's Charter or By-Laws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect, subject to the terms described on Schedule 6.12(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the current policies of directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company) only with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time. Section 6.13 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 6.14 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, upon any director or officer of Parent or the Company (as applicable) becoming aware of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.14, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.14 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger. Section 6.15 TAKEOVER STATUTES. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 203 of the GCL be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the Company. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company's Board of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.

providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock, and of options to purchase Parent Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information (as defined below), is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition by the Company Insiders of the Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Parent Common Stock, and the disposition of their Company Stock Options which will be deemed to occur upon the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as listed in the Section 16 Information.

Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: AJ Ragosta, EMC 508-293-6884 ragosta_aj@emc.com Kathleen O'Boyle, Documentum 925-600-6727 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE kathleen.oboyle@documentum.com ------------------------------ EMC ANNOUNCES PLAN TO ACQUIRE DOCUMENTUM, FURTHER ADVANCING INFORMATION LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES Information-Centric Leaders Join to Help Organizations Simplify Management of Rapidly Growing Volumes of Unstructured Content HOPKINTON, Mass., and PLEASANTON, Calif. - October 14, 2003 - EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the leader in information storage, and Documentum, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCTM), a leader in enterprise content management software, today announced a definitive agreement for EMC to acquire Documentum in a stock transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion. EMC's acquisition of Documentum combines two leading information-centric technology companies with a shared commitment to enabling organizations to maximize the value of their information across the enterprise. Documentum's enterprise content management software allows organizations to proactively manage their unstructured content - from electronic documents such as Web pages and spreadsheets to medical records and audio/video content - and leverage that content to power business operations and gain competitive advantage. By incorporating intelligent content management with EMC's market-leading open software for data protection, storage management, and information management, and market-leading networked storage platforms, customers will be able to better align their content with their information infrastructure based on its value over time. This combination will enable customers to implement a total information lifecycle management solution for managing unstructured content, from creation and use to archive and disposal. Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "Information is one of the most strategic assets in any organization, and EMC technology has helped store, manage and protect vast amounts of information for our customers. Software is central to our strategy of delivering comprehensive information lifecycle management solutions that allow customers to select the appropriate levels of availability, protection and speed of access at every point in the information lifecycle, at the lowest total cost. EMC, Documentum and LEGATO have achieved a combined total of more than $2 billion in software license and support revenues in the most recent 12 months." "Much of the information in today's enterprise is unstructured data," continued Tucci. "Documentum enables organizations to organize and manage their growing volumes of unstructured data by leveraging knowledge about that data - information about information. We believe Documentum's rich software development talent, its management strength and depth, its top-notch sales, marketing and services expertise in content management, and its blue-chip customer base will add significant strategic value as EMC continues to evolve." Documentum's enterprise content management platform offers the most extensive modular suite of content management and collaboration software in the industry, providing customers with automated document management, records management, Web content management, digital asset management, and collaboration in a single, integrated content platform and repository. Documentum and EMC have successfully worked together since the April 2002 introduction of EMC Centera, the world's first content addressed storage (CAS) solution. Documentum's enterprise content management software platform is one of more than 65 leading applications that have integrated with Centera's open CAS platform under the EMC Developers Program. Dave DeWalt, Documentum's President and CEO, said, "As a company we continue to see customers needing enterprise content management expertise, and the need for our products and services is growing and becoming more strategic to our target customers. EMC's significant R&D investments, leadership position in automated networked storage solutions, global distribution and service capabilities, and overall financial strength will provide the scale and resources for Documentum to attain our market potential. As a result, the combination of Documentum and EMC represents an outstanding opportunity for our stockholders, employees, customers and partners." Under terms of the agreement, Documentum stockholders will receive 2.175 shares of EMC common stock for each share of Documentum common stock. Based upon the EMC closing stock price of $14.45 on October 13, 2003, the transaction is valued at approximately $1.7 billion, excluding net cash in the business. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including Documentum's stockholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of calendar year 2004. When completed, EMC expects to take a charge in the quarter the transaction is closed for the value of Documentum's in-process research and development costs and other integration expenses. Including the aforementioned charges, the transaction is expected to be dilutive in the first quarter of 2004 by $0.02 per diluted share. The transaction is not expected to materially impact EPS for the remainder of 2004, and is expected to be slightly accretive in 2005. Upon completion of the acquisition, EMC intends to operate Documentum as a software division of EMC headquartered in Pleasanton, California, led by Dave DeWalt, Documentum's current CEO. Documentum's sales, marketing and services will remain focused on selling and servicing Documentum's products and solutions. Conference Call & Webcast EMC President and CEO Joe Tucci, Documentum President and CEO Dave DeWalt, and EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Bill Teuber will discuss the acquisition on a conference call for financial analysts, investors and the news media at 8:30 a.m. EDT, today.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 16, 2003, EMC issued a press release announcing financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and shall be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: October 16, 2003
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  October 16, 2003  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2003, reflecting balanced double-digit growth across all major business segments and improved profitability.
 
Total consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $1.51 billion, 20% higher than the $1.26 billion reported for the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the third quarter was $159 million or $.07 per diluted share, including a $.02 benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. This compares with net income of $21 million or $.01 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2002.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "We are pleased that our third-quarter results reflect strong customer acceptance of EMC's comprehensive lineup of automated networked storage solutions. We are on track to achieve double-digit growth for the year, which not many large technology companies will do in this challenging economic environment. With 11% revenue growth for the first nine months of 2003 compared with the same period in 2002, it is clear that we continue to gain market share and extend EMC's lead as the world's #1 provider of information storage solutions."
 
Tucci continued, "With Tuesday's announcement of our agreement to acquire Documentum and the pending completion of our acquisition of LEGATO, two complementary leaders in information management software, we are making the strategic moves necessary to enable our customers to manage all of their information according to its value to the business at every stage of its life, at the lowest total cost  creating the ultimate information lifecycle management company."
 
EMC's revenue growth was balanced across all major segments of its business. In particular, information storage software revenue grew to 23% of the company's total revenue, driven by demand for replication, multi-platform management and content-addressed storage (CAS) software. Information storage systems revenue also had strong double-digit growth on a year-to-year basis, led by EMC's new Symmetrix DMX and CLARiiON CX networked information storage systems. Double-digit revenue growth in information storage services was spurred by strong customer demand for EMC's storage-focused professional services.
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The blend of new products and crisp execution across the entire organization enabled EMC to turn in strong top- and bottom-line results in what is traditionally the most challenging quarter of the year. We enhanced our balance sheet by growing cash and investments by almost $130 million to nearly $6.2 billion during the quarter, while buying back nearly $100 million worth of the company's stock."
 
EMC's rapid delivery of new products continued in the third quarter. Highlights include the unveiling of the next major wave of Symmetrix DMX systems, software and related technologies, including the new Symmetrix DMX3000, an entry-level Symmetrix DMX800 configuration, new advanced replication technology, native iSCSI connectivity and enhanced functionality for mainframe customers; the extension of EMC CLARiiON's functional leadership through major enhancements to EMC Navisphere, EMC SnapView and EMC SAN Copy software; the strengthening of EMC's open software portfolio with the addition of powerful new VisualSRM and VisualSAN software for small-and medium-sized organizations; and the introduction of EMC OpenScale, the world's first automated "pay as you go" billing for storage infrastructure.
 
EMC continued to extend its market reach in the third quarter by announcing its agreement to acquire LEGATO Systems, Inc., and create the world's most comprehensive portfolio of information storage software; partnering with BMC Software, the first independent software provider to resell EMC ControlCenter storage management software; and broadening its relationship with Oracle Corporation to include a new joint service available to help customers easily deploy Oracle Database with EMC network attached storage (NAS) technology.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements assume the acquisition of LEGATO Systems, Inc., closes on or about October 20, 2003, and the acquisition of Documentum, Inc., closes at the beginning of January 2004. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof, except for the planned acquisitions of LEGATO Systems, Inc., and Documentum, Inc.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and as a result of the Merger, each share of LEGATO common stock outstanding at the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive 0.9 of a share of EMC common stock. In addition, upon completion of the Merger, EMC assumed certain LEGATO stock plans and outstanding options to purchase shares of LEGATO common stock, adjusted to reflect the conversion ratio referred to above. The conversion ratio was determined through arm's length negotiations. Following consummation of the Merger, LEGATO's common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 22, 2004  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported fourth-quarter and full fiscal year financial results for 2003, reflecting strong customer demand for the company's broad portfolio of systems, software and services for information lifecycle management.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's fourth quarter was $1.86 billion, 25% higher than the $1.49 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income for the fourth quarter was $220 million or $.09 per diluted share, including a net benefit of $.01 resulting from certain income tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other special charges primarily related to the completed acquisitions of LEGATO Systems, Inc., and Documentum, Inc. This compares with a net loss of $64 million or ($.03) per share for the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2003 fiscal year was $6.24 billion, 15% higher than the $5.44 billion reported for the full 2002 fiscal year. Net income for the full 2003 fiscal year was $496 million or $.22 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $119 million or ($.05) per share for the full 2002 fiscal year.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "The strength of our broadened product portfolio, combined with outstanding execution and an improving global economy, made for a solid finish to 2003. Our information lifecycle management strategy is being well received by both long-standing and new customers who are grappling with the challenges of compliance, information protection and constrained budgets. EMC strengthened its market position and clearly gained share in 2003."
 
Tucci continued, "I could not be prouder of the EMC team. The impact of helping our customers control both their information and their costs is evident in today's results. Our innovation engine continued to run in overdrive throughout the year, enabling us to rapidly deliver new capabilities and functionality to our customers, who will reap even greater benefits from our aggressive product development in 2004."
 
EMC's revenue growth was strong across all major business segments and geographies in the fourth quarter. EMC Symmetrix, CLARiiON and Centera networked storage systems and core EMC software and services, which excludes revenue from LEGATO Software and
Documentum, each experienced double-digit sequential revenue growth compared with the third quarter of 2003. Total CLARiiON revenue, which includes systems and related software, reached nearly $1 billion for the full year, continuing to rapidly gain share in the mid-tier storage market. Connectivity revenues also had double-digit sequential growth, stimulated by high demand for EMC's groundbreaking new NAS Gateway, the Celerra NS600G. Consolidated international revenue grew 33% compared to the same period a year ago, representing a record 43% of EMC's fourth quarter revenues.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "For the year we reached and exceeded every major financial goal we set at the start of 2003. We were increasingly profitable during each quarter of 2003 and grew revenues every quarter over the preceding one throughout the year. Our crisp execution translated into continued improvements in our cost structure and additional margin expansion. We ended the year with the strongest balance sheet in EMC's history with more than $6.9 billion in cash and investments."
 
During the fourth quarter, EMC completed the acquisitions of LEGATO Systems, Inc., on October 20, and Documentum, Inc., on December 18, significantly expanding the world's most comprehensive portfolio of information lifecycle management solutions. LEGATO and Documentum each achieved record revenue during the fourth quarter. LEGATO and Documentum revenue recognized after the respective closings of these acquisitions are included in EMC's fourth quarter and full fiscal year results.
 
EMC's market-leading Symmetrix DMX high-end storage systems were named "Product of the Year" for 2003 among all disk and disk subsystems by TechTarget's Storage magazine and Searchstorage.com. Among other highlights of the fourth quarter, EMC continued to broaden its product portfolio and gain industry-wide recognition for delivering innovation and award-winning service to customers around the globe. EMC unveiled a series of new mid-tier network-attached storage (NAS) systems, including the NS600G NAS Gateway and NetWin 200 systems. EMC's LEGATO Software division delivered enhancements to its RepliStor for Windows Storage Server solution, allowing for the support of many-to-one and one-to-many replication configurations for data consolidation on a Windows Storage Server. Both EMC and LEGATO were recognized by the Service and Support Professionals Association (SSPA) for outstanding customer support. magazine selected EMC as the Best Storage Solutions Provider for 2003, and (CPM) magazine inducted EMC into the CPM Hall of Fame for its contributions to business continuity.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 15, 2004  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported strong, double-digit revenue growth and triple-digit net income growth on a year-to-year basis for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's first quarter was $1.87 billion, 35% higher than the $1.38 billion reported for the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $140 million or $.06 per diluted share, including a charge of $.01 per share, primarily related to the January 8, 2004, acquisition of VMware and certain additional restructuring charges. This compares with net income of $35 million or $.02 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2003.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "The first quarter marked EMC's highest revenue growth rate in nearly three years, measured with or without the inclusion of our recent acquisitions. This accelerating growth, which I believe is among the highest of any major IT supplier, is being fueled by customers around the world embracing EMC technology that saves them money, simplifies their operations and protects their information assets. We are delivering the world's broadest lineup of storage and information management products and services, all focused on empowering organizations to get the maximum value from their information at every point in the information lifecycle."
 
Tucci continued, "EMC's new software divisions Documentum, LEGATO Software and VMware, also played an important role in the quarter as customers grappled with the explosion of digital content, continued the shift to disk-based recovery solutions and reaped the benefits of virtualized computing resources."
 
Global customer demand for EMC's expanded portfolio of information management and storage systems, software and services resulted in solid, double-digit revenue growth across each of EMC's businesses in the first quarter. Core EMC revenue, which excludes revenue from Documentum, LEGATO Software and VMware, grew approximately 21% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2003. EMC's new, independent software divisions performed well during the quarter, with Documentum, LEGATO Software and VMware, on a combined basis, growing their revenue more than 30% compared with the first quarter of 2003. Consolidated international revenue, benefiting from EMC's continued focus and investment in
Europe, Asia and Latin America, represented 43% of EMC's first-quarter revenues, compared with 37% for the year-ago quarter.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "EMC finished the first quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and investments, after investing nearly $600 million on the acquisition of VMware and our stock buyback program. In addition to providing EMC with needed agility to react to future opportunities, a portion of these funds will be used to strengthen our new software divisions, deepen our penetration in the commercial market, expand further into promising regions in Asia and Eastern Europe, enhance EMC's own information infrastructure, and continue to evolve EMC' into one of the world's most powerful and recognized technology brands."
 
First Quarter Highlights
 
EMC information storage systems revenue, bolstered by a sweeping wave of first quarter enhancements and innovations across the entire lineup of EMC tiered networked storage platforms, grew 19% compared to the year-ago quarter. Core EMC information storage software revenue increased 26% compared to the same period a year ago. First-quarter software highlights included the introduction of the EMC DatabaseXtender software suite, which monitors database growth and usage and intelligently relocates inactive data to various EMC or non-EMC storage systems. Core EMC services revenue grew 23% compared to the year ago quarter, due to growing demand for information lifecycle management services and an increase in software maintenance revenues. EMC also broadened the global reach of EMC information storage and management products during the quarter by forming new distribution relationships with TechData in the U.S. and Samsung Electronics in Korea.
 
Documentum, acquired by EMC in December 2003, delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues and added more than 100 new customers in the first quarter. Documentum announced the first and only complete virtual repository solution enabled in part by technology acquired from Xerox Corporation in March, and two new compliance products to help organizations address regulatory and business requirements. Documentum also successfully demonstrated the mainframe-level performance and scalability of the Documentum 5 ECM platform with a billion-object repository benchmark.
 
LEGATO Software, acquired by EMC in October 2003, delivered its best first quarter revenues ever and added more than 300 new customers. During the quarter LEGATO improved the heterogeneous storage integration and support of the LEGATO DiskXtender 2000 software and partnered with Microsoft and EMC to develop a joint data consolidation and business continuity solution. Also during the quarter, LEGATO tightened integration between LEGATO DiskXtender and EmailXtender products with EMC Centera and LEGATO NetWorker software with EMC CLARiiON to answer customer need for comprehensive email compliance and backup-to-disk solutions.
 
VMware, acquired by EMC in January 2004, exceeded revenue expectations during its first quarter as an EMC subsidiary, posting record revenues and triple-digit growth as customers turned to VMware technology to consolidate server and workstation operations. VMware continued to advance the virtualization industry with new releases of its server virtual infrastructure software. Also during the quarter, VMware strengthened its relationship with Dell through a new agreement, evidence that VMware's value is resonating with partners and their customers.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 20, 2004  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2004, achieving its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and more than doubling net income compared with the year-ago period.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's second quarter was $1.97 billion, 33% higher than the $1.48 billion reported for the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the quarter was $193 million or $.08 per diluted share, 136% higher than the $82 million or $.04 per diluted share reported for the second quarter of 2003.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "I was pleased with our overall execution and financial results in the second quarter. Clearly the highlight of the quarter was our strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and resulting market-share gains in each of our business lines. The main driver of this growth was strong execution of our information lifecycle management strategy and solutions, which are enjoying an excellent reception from our customers and the overall IT marketplace.
 
"I continue to believe the overall market environment for storage and information management technology is rich with opportunity yet challenging, as customers continue to demand more from IT providers. They are looking for broader best of breed' solution sets and better service and support, and they are uncompromising when it comes to improving the total cost of ownership and overall returns on their IT investments. We think our strategy and our portfolio are very well suited for this challenge."
 
Core EMC revenue, which excludes product and service revenue from EMC's Documentum, LEGATO Software and VMware businesses, grew 19% compared with the second quarter of 2003. Core EMC international revenue grew 24%, with double-digit revenue growth in each major geography including Europe, Asia and Latin America.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our extensive product and services portfolio and expanded market reach helped us to achieve our financial goals in the second quarter. We continued to drive revenue growth, improve gross margins and increase cash flow, while improving operating income to more than 12% of revenues  putting us squarely on track to reach our mid-teens operating margin goal by the end of the year."
Second Quarter Highlights
 
EMC systems revenue grew 16% compared with the year-ago quarter as customers around the world aligned the value of their information to the appropriate platform within EMC's expanded family of tiered information storage. EMC's systems business in the quarter was led by EMC CLARiiON and EMC Celerra NAS platforms, which both had revenue growth of more than 40% compared with the year-ago quarter.
 
EMC software revenue increased 64% compared with the same period a year ago, buoyed by strong double-digit growth from sales of EMC's core storage software and the impact of the Documentum, LEGATO Software and VMware acquisitions. LEGATO Software delivered a record second quarter, driven by a 20% year-over-year increase in software license sales. Documentum also achieved double-digit year-over-year growth, with revenues increasing 14%.
 
VMware delivered record quarterly revenues in its second quarter as a separate subsidiary of EMC, as organizations turned to the virtual infrastructure software leader to virtualize industry-standard servers and desktops throughout the enterprise.
 
EMC services revenue grew 45% compared with the year-ago quarter, driven by increased software maintenance revenue, customer demand for information lifecycle management solutions and the impact of EMC's recent acquisitions.
 
EMC expanded its market reach through major new and enhanced partner agreements during the quarter. EMC announced it will resell Advanced Digital Information Corporation's (ADIC) tape library solutions to broaden its lineup of tiered networked storage; Langchao Electronic Information Industry Corp., Ltd., a leading server vendor in China, agreed to OEM the entire line of EMC CLARiiON products; Dell added EMC's LEGATO backup and replication software to its storage management offering; and VMware strengthened its relationships with systems vendors IBM and HP.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  October 19, 2004  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2004, achieving its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's third quarter was $2.03 billion, 34% higher than the $1.51 billion reported for the third quarter of 2003. Net income for the quarter was $218 million or $.09 per diluted share, 37% higher than the $159 million or $.07 per diluted share reported for the third quarter of 2003.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "We again achieved solid, balanced performance in a spending environment that continues to improve at a steady but modest pace. In each of the first three quarters of 2004, we have grown revenues almost three times faster than our overall addressable market. Clearly, our focus on information lifecycle management is influencing and improving how customers manage and store information, as well as setting the agenda for our industry as a whole."
 
Core EMC revenue, which excludes revenue related to EMC's Documentum, Legato and VMware acquisitions, grew 19% compared with the third quarter of 2003. All of EMC's major geographies recorded double-digit core revenue growth, with each of EMC's international regions gaining more than 20%.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "We have now met or exceeded our financial goals for eight consecutive quarters. During the third quarter, our gross and operating margins continued to expand, and our already strong balance sheet got even stronger. Cash and investments exceeded $7 billion for the first time in the company's history while we remained active in the market, buying back $108 million of our stock during the quarter. I am particularly pleased with the returns we are seeing from investments made to broaden our product portfolio and expand our customer reach, which have allowed us to penetrate more deeply into high-growth markets."
Third Quarter Highlights
 
EMC systems revenue grew 18% compared with the year-ago quarter as customers of all sizes aligned the value of their information to platforms within EMC's expanded family of tiered information storage.
 
"Our commitment to developing the market's most economical, functionally rich mid-tier systems and software is clearly paying off," commented Tucci. "Our traditional enterprise customers, along with our rapidly growing base of small to medium-sized customers, are integrating these solutions into their ILM-enabled infrastructures. In the third quarter, our CLARiiON, Centera and NAS (network attached storage) businesses collectively grew well over 50%."
 
EMC software license revenue increased 56% compared with the same period a year ago, driven by the Documentum, Legato and VMware acquisitions and double-digit growth from sales of EMC's core storage software.
 
The newly formed EMC Software Group, which markets and develops platform-independent information storage and content management software, delivered consolidated revenues of $351 million in the third quarter as customers around the world implemented EMC software to reduce costs, streamline complex IT operations and handle explosive data growth. The major components of EMC Software Group, including core EMC multi-platform software, Documentum and Legato, each had double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter over the comparable year-ago quarter.
 
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, delivered record quarterly revenues of $61 million in the third quarter, an increase of more than 200% over the third quarter of 2003. With the introduction of VMware ACE in the third quarter, VMware again demonstrated its relentless innovation and aggressive technology leadership. VMware solves the problems of efficiency, flexibility and security with its comprehensive solutions for servers, desktops and test and development that provide an easy on-ramp to next-generation computing models.
 
EMC services revenue grew 48% compared with the year-ago third quarter, due to the impact of EMC's software company acquisitions, increased core software maintenance revenue and continued customer demand for information lifecycle management solutions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  December 21, 2004  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information storage and management, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire SMARTS, Inc., for approximately $260 million in cash, subject to closing adjustments. SMARTS is a fast-growing, privately held technology leader in event automation and real-time network systems management software. SMARTS expects its fiscal 2004 revenues to be slightly more than $60 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and is not expected to have a material impact to EPS for the full 2005 fiscal year.
 
A leader in the service-centric approach to network systems management, SMARTS' patented modeling and correlation technologies dynamically capture knowledge about the inter-relationships, behaviors and characteristics of any IT environment to be managed. SMARTS' InCharge software products automatically pinpoint root cause problems, calculate their impacts across technology domains, and present the logical action plan required to keep business services up and running. SMARTS InCharge is being used by the world's leading enterprises and service providers to increase availability and performance of mission-critical, revenue-generating business services, while significantly reducing operational costs.
 
Over time, SMARTS will enable EMC storage management software to intelligently correlate, determine root cause problems and present a plan of action for critical problems across the storage network. An important attribute of information lifecycle management (ILM) is the uninterrupted flow and movement of information. The health, well-being and management of the information network will serve as a cornerstone for any comprehensive ILM strategy.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC President and CEO, said, "This acquisition is about market expansion, innovative technology and growth. SMARTS represents a strategic acquisition for EMC in a complementary, growing market  network systems management. EMC is committed to dedicating the resources required to expand SMARTS' current market presence, while also applying their world-class modeling, correlation and root cause analysis technology to expand our lead in information and storage management."
Shaula Alexander Yemini, SMARTS Founder and President, said, "This combination is a great fit, at the right time, for SMARTS and our customers. EMC and SMARTS share a vision for event automation and real-time network systems management and their increasing importance as the IT world becomes more complex, heterogeneous and dynamic. With the help of EMC, SMARTS now has at our disposal the resources to realize the full potential of our technology, and bring a broader set of products to a larger customer base much faster."
 
Chris Gahagan, Senior Vice President, EMC Software, said, "This acquisition not only expands EMC's software portfolio and market lead, but will play an important role in taking customers to the next level of storage management. As the convergence of data and storage networks continues, SMARTS extensible technology will enable EMC to take advanced management and real-time analysis capabilities developed for the data network and apply them across heterogeneous storage networks."
 
SMARTS technology can be deployed either stand-alone or integrated with existing systems management frameworks. SMARTS integrates with and enhances traditional systems management frameworks by adding automated, actionable intelligence.
 
Upon completion of the acquisition, SMARTS will be integrated into the EMC Software Group with a dedicated specialty sales force focused on selling SMARTS' products.
 
A Webcast beginning today at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) at will be hosted by Howard Elias, EMC's Executive Vice President, Corporate Marketing and Office of Technology, and Shaula Alexander Yemini, SMARTS Founder and President.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 25, 2005, EMC Corporation ("EMC") issued a press release announcing financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The press release contains EMC's Business Outlook which includes certain forward-looking numbers that may constitute non-GAAP financial measures due to the fact that these numbers do not include the impact of expensing stock options under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 123R (FAS 123R), which will be effective for fiscal quarters after June 15, 2005. EMC is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking measures to GAAP because EMC is currently in the process of assessing its implementation of FAS 123R and, therefore, the amount of stock option expense is unknown at this time. Notwithstanding the fact that these forward-looking numbers exclude the impact of expensing stock options, management believes that these forward-looking numbers are useful to investors because they provide insight into management's current expectations for the performance of EMC's business. Management also believes such information is useful because it represents the manner in which EMC's business is currently being managed.
 
The press release may also contain other non-GAAP financial measures. If any other non-GAAP financial measures are presented, reconciliation to GAAP is included. Management uses any such non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of its comparative operating performance. Management believes that these measures provide useful information because they exclude activities that are not necessarily relevant to understand EMC's business.
 
The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 25, 2005  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported strong fourth-quarter and full fiscal year financial results for 2004. EMC's sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth was driven by robust customer demand for its expanded software portfolio, tiered networked storage systems and professional services.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's fourth quarter was $2.36 billion, 27% higher than the $1.86 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income for the quarter grew 46% to $321 million or $.13 per diluted share, compared with $220 million or $.09 per diluted share reported for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2004 fiscal year was $8.23 billion, 32% higher than the $6.24 billion reported for the full 2003 fiscal year. Net income for the full 2004 fiscal year grew 76% to $871 million or $.36 per diluted share, compared with $496 million or $.22 per diluted share reported for the full 2003 fiscal year.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "EMC had a strong finish to a solid 2004. Customers rewarded our focus on information lifecycle management (ILM) with a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our people, products and partners continue to define what is required to be the best-of-breed provider of systems, software, services and integrated solutions for comprehensive information storage and management."
 
"2004 was an exceptional year for EMC," continued Tucci. "We extended our market and technology position across all of our major segments and geographies, while significantly advancing our ILM and VMware's virtual infrastructure strategies. In 2005, we intend to further expand our share of an expected $51 billion market opportunity by accelerating our pace of innovation, driving additional value from our acquired
 
companies, expanding our channel partner network and increasing our focus on overall customer satisfaction."
 
Core EMC revenue in the fourth quarter of 2004, which excludes revenue related to EMC's Dantz, Documentum, Legato and VMware acquisitions, grew 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. All of EMC's major geographies recorded double-digit revenue growth, with consolidated international revenue increasing 26% during the quarter.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "For the second consecutive year we exceeded every major financial goal that we set in January. Moving our operating margins up into the mid-teens has been a focus for some time, and we finished the fourth quarter in that range. Cash and investments grew by more than $400 million during the quarter, while we continued to leverage our financial strength by buying back $128 million in company stock and acquiring Dantz Development Corporation. The strength of our balance sheet will continue to provide us with solid financial footing for our growth plans moving forward."
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
Systems revenue grew 15% compared with the year-ago quarter, with every product category showing year-over-year growth. Growth in EMC Symmetrix networked storage systems revenue confirmed that EMC continued its high-end market share gains in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, EMC CLARiiON networked storage systems revenues grew 46% as small to medium-sized enterprises embraced CLARiiON's unique blend of functionality and affordability. The new EMC CLARiiON Disk Library (CDL) products were notably strong as customers implemented EMC's backup-to-disk solutions to reduce recovery times. EMC Celerra NAS (networked attached storage) and EMC Centera CAS (content addressed storage) products continued to gain momentum in the marketplace with strong, double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Centera had a record quarter, growing revenues 48% over the year-ago quarter.
 
Total software license revenue in the fourth quarter increased 43% compared with the same period a year ago, driven by EMC's acquisitions of Dantz, Documentum, Legato and VMware, and by a 26% year-over-year increase in EMC's quarterly core software sales.
 
The EMC Software Group reported consolidated revenues of $410 million in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of 17% compared with the third quarter of 2004. Each of the EMC Software Group's major components had record revenues during the quarter, with double-digit revenue growth across EMC's core multi-platform, Documentum and Legato software products. The EMC Software Group saw notable product strength during the quarter from its EMC Legato NetWorker software, EMC Documentum Enterprise Content Management Platforms and EMC ControlCenter software family.
 
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, delivered record quarterly revenues of $71 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 159% over VMware's fourth-quarter 2003 results. VMware's torrid growth was led by strong customer demand for its enterprise products, including VMware ESX Server and VMware Virtual Center.
 
EMC services revenue grew 35% compared with the year-ago fourth quarter. The increase was due to the impact of EMC's software acquisitions, growing software maintenance revenues and customer demand for assistance in implementing information lifecycle management.
 
"We believe our broadened product portfolio delivered share gains across each of our business lines in the fourth quarter," Tucci said. "Growth among our platforms was driven by our mid-tier systems and supported by our market-leading high-end EMC Symmetrix family, which recorded its highest quarterly revenue in more than two years. Our recent acquisitions continued to have momentum in the market. Solutions from Legato and Documentum each delivered in excess of $100 million in quarterly revenues for the first time, and VMware maintained its triple-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter as an EMC subsidiary."
 
2004 Highlights
 
EMC's revenue growth was strong across all major business lines in 2004. EMC's systems business, which grew revenues 17%, benefited from Symmetrix's year-long high-end share gains and CLARiiON's record performance, which completely changed the dynamics of the mid-tier market in 2004.
 
Total software revenues, including license and maintenance revenues, grew to $2.98 billion and accounted for more than a third of total revenues in 2004, due in part to the outstanding performance of EMC's recent software acquisitions. VMware alone nearly tripled its revenues in 2004, cementing its position as the fastest-growing software concern of its size.
 
Services revenues grew 44% in 2004, due to increased customer demand for professional service implementations and increased software maintenance revenues.
 
Consolidated international revenues grew 39% in 2004, driven by double-digit revenue growth in Europe, Asia and Latin America. International revenue represented 42% of EMC's total 2004 revenues, compared with 40% in 2003.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the impact of expensing stock options under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 123R (FAS 123R), which will be effective for fiscal quarters after June 15, 2005

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass. - February 2, 2005 - EMC Corporation, the world leader in information storage and management, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of SMARTS, a privately held technology leader in event automation and real-time network systems management software. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement announced on December 21, 2004, EMC acquired SMARTS for approximately $260 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
 
In addition to expanding SMARTS' current network systems management market presence, EMC plans to apply the world-class SMARTS modeling, correlation and root cause analysis technology to expand its lead in information and storage management.
 
Joe Tucci, President and CEO, EMC Corporation, said, "The addition of SMARTS expands EMC's presence into an adjacent and fast-growing market: network systems management. We've hit the ground running and already have begun to apply the necessary resources to grow the current SMARTS business while executing on and expanding the SMARTS product roadmap. EMC will extend and leverage the SMARTS portfolio to support current and future SMARTS customer requirements while exploring a range of new storage-specific opportunities for SMARTS technology."
 
Over time, SMARTS will enable EMC storage management software to intelligently correlate and determine root cause problems and present a plan of action for critical problems across a storage network. The health, well-being and management of the information network will serve as a cornerstone for any comprehensive information lifecycle management (ILM) strategy.
 
"As a long-time customer of both EMC and SMARTS, we're very excited by today's news," said James Lancaster, Vice President, Fifth Third Bank. "Both companies have a complementary vision for the future. We see this as a prime opportunity for EMC to build SMARTS' core business as well as drive the technology into the storage domain. From a customer perspective, this is definitely a winning proposition."
 
Immediately following the announcement of EMC's intent to acquire SMARTS, the two companies assembled a cross-company, cross-functional team to analyze and plan for SMARTS integration into EMC. Planning is complete, and SMARTS now will be integrated into the EMC Software Group. The specialized SMARTS sales force and channel partners, including Cisco, will continue to sell SMARTS offerings while leveraging the EMC direct sales force for expanded growth.
 
EMC will also further enhance SMARTS' strong customer support capabilities. For example, with the addition of EMC personnel and infrastructure, customers will have true follow-the-sun global support.
 
In addition to extending the SMARTS technology to create solutions tailored to key industry verticals such as healthcare, financial and converging telecommunications services, EMC also will make SMARTS' technology available to existing EMC partners for integration into their offerings.
 
Patented SMARTS modeling and correlation technologies dynamically capture knowledge about the interrelationships, behaviors and characteristics of any IT environment to be managed. SMARTS InCharge(tm) software products automatically pinpoint root cause problems, calculate their impact across technology domains and present the logical action plan required to keep business services up and running. SMARTS InCharge is used by the world's leading enterprises and service providers to increase availability and performance of mission-critical, revenue-generating business services while significantly reducing operational costs.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 19, 2005  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2005, achieving double-digit year-to-year revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. EMC, the world leader in information storage and management, saw first-quarter growth driven by its market-leading mid-tier storage systems, expanding software business, and increasingly popular professional services.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's first quarter was $2.24 billion, 20% higher than the $1.87 billion reported for the first quarter of 2004. Net income for the quarter was $270 million or $.11 per diluted share, 93% higher than the $140 million or $.06 per diluted share reported for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "EMC delivered its seventh quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth, once again extending one of the strongest and steadiest growth stories in the tech industry today. Solid execution and the investments we have made to broaden our product and market reach played major roles in our ability to successfully navigate through a difficult first quarter."
 
"Clearly, our acquisition strategy is bearing fruit, strengthening our core business and taking us into opportunity-rich adjacent markets," Tucci continued. "We are satisfying customers' demands with a product portfolio that is second to none and by leveraging our market leadership across all major segments of our business. We are using these combined strengths to greater and greater effect as our hardware, software and services offerings become even more tightly integrated and as we continue our new product introductions this year."
 
Systems revenue grew 15% in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter, to $1.03 billion, driven by strong, double-digit growth from the EMC CLARiiON, Celerra NAS and Centera platforms. Strong performances across each of EMC's software businesses grew software license and maintenance revenues 26% to $832 million in the first quarter, now representing 37% of total EMC revenues. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 26% to $375 million during the quarter, as customers around the globe turned to EMC to help manage the growing complexity of their information infrastructures.
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our tenth straight quarter of meeting or exceeding our major financial objectives places us firmly on track to deliver on our 2005 goals. During the quarter, we continued to execute well across the board, achieving double-digit growth in all three major business lines and all of our major geographic regions. We generated more than $600 million in cash from operations and used $380 million to acquire SMARTS and buy back 9.8 million shares of company stock. We were particularly pleased with our operating margins for the quarter, and we believe we are on course to end the year with operating margins in the high teens."
 
First Quarter Highlights
 
Demand for EMC's broad portfolio of tiered networked storage platforms and related software drove double-digit revenue growth across its platforms businesses in the first quarter. EMC CLARiiON networked storage revenues grew 47% year over year, posting solid growth across all major geographic regions, particularly Europe, and in each of EMC's direct and indirect channels. CLARiiON's fourth consecutive quarter of more than 40% revenue growth was driven by EMC's focus on delivering complete solutions that address the needs of midsize enterprises. EMC Celerra NAS systems revenue grew 40% during the quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 30% revenue growth. Customer deployments of the EMC Celerra NS Gateway filers and NS integrated products into tiered storage environments continued to drive market momentum for the industry's most comprehensive family of NAS solutions.
 
The EMC Software Group reported revenues of $401 million in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 24%. Growth across the EMC Software Group's major categories was fueled by the tremendous value customers are realizing from the ability of EMC software to help them reduce operational costs and complexity and to comply with government regulations. Storage and Management Software license revenue, which includes EMC PowerPath, the EMC ControlCenter and EMC Visual product families, and the EMC Smarts software product family, grew 21% in the first quarter. Backup and Archive software license revenue, which comprises all EMC software for backup and archiving including the EMC Dantz software family, grew revenues 36% during the quarter, driven by EMC Legato NetWorker, EMC Dantz Retrospect, EMC EmailXtender, EMC DiskXtender and EMC Replication Manager software. Content Management Software license revenue, including the entire EMC Documentum line, grew 23% with the addition of more than 125 new customers during the quarter.
 
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, reported record quarterly revenues of $80 million in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 104%. VMware booked a record number of new deals, and license sales represented nearly 80% of VMware's first-quarter revenues. VMware's triple-digit revenue growth was led by strong customer demand for its virtual infrastructure software products used widely for server consolidation and containment, business continuity, test/development and the enterprise desktop. During the quarter VMware continued to strengthen its channels and deepen relationships with Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel. In the last year, VMware's innovation, excellence and strategic importance to customers around the world have been recognized through more than 20 industry awards.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 21, 2005  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information storage and management, today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2005, achieving double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. EMC's second quarter growth was driven by its market-leading mid-tier storage systems, increasingly popular virtual infrastructure software from its VMware subsidiary, and an expanding services business.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's second quarter was $2.34 billion, 19% higher than the $1.97 billion reported for the second quarter of 2004. Net income for the quarter was $293 million, 52% higher than the $193 million reported for the second quarter of 2004. Earnings per diluted share was $0.12, an increase from the $0.08 per diluted share reported for the year-ago quarter.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "We continued to execute in the second quarter, resulting in revenue growth that we believe was more than twice the rate of the market. EMC leads one of the fastest-growing segments of IT and it is clear we are gaining share. We're committed to strengthening and expanding our portfolio so we can meet even more of our customers' needs and open up new market opportunities."
 
"This was our eighth quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth not only for the company, but also across our major geographies and business lines," continued Tucci. "Our sustained performance is a direct result of the tremendous market acceptance of EMC's Information Lifecycle Management solutions, which we build from our broad portfolio of proven, best-of-breed platforms, software, and services. With our expanded portfolio, we're able to help more customers, in more ways, manage the complexity of their IT environments, harness their information growth, and solve their toughest business challenges."
 
Systems revenue grew 15% in the second quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter, to $1.1 billion. EMC's software businesses grew software license and maintenance revenues 23% year on year to $878 million in the second quarter, representing 37% of total EMC revenues. Professional services, systems maintenance, and other services revenue grew 26% year on year to $389 million during the quarter.
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our focus on driving profitable growth while gaining market share is working exceptionally well, as evidenced by our 11
th
consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our major financial targets. During the quarter we leveraged the power of our product portfolio to grow net income at nearly three times the rate of revenue growth, expand gross margins to 53.6%, and continue our march toward high-teens operating margins by year end. We also continued to strengthen our financial position in the quarter, ending June with nearly $7.7 billion in cash and investments after buying back $144 million worth of EMC shares in the quarter."
 
Second Quarter Highlights
 
EMC Symmetrix product revenue grew 4% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2004 as large enterprises deployed EMC's market- and performance-leading Symmetrix DMX-2 information storage systems to manage their most demanding information storage requirements. EMC CLARiiON product revenues grew 32%, the 10th consecutive quarter of more than 30% revenue growth. EMC CLARiiON, the information storage system mid-tier market and performance leader, had its strongest growth in Europe and among small- to-medium-sized enterprises. EMC platform software, including license and maintenance revenues, grew 24%, reflecting growth across each of EMC's storage systems, driven by customer demand for EMC's market leading replication software to safeguard their information assets.
 
The EMC Software Group reported second quarter revenues of $408 million in open, platform-independent software, a year-over-year increase of 16%. Backup, Recovery and Archive software license revenue, which increased 28% during the quarter, was the strongest growth performer within the EMC Software Group. Enterprise customers continued to leverage EMC Legato NetWorker for backup-to-disk solutions and deployed EMC EmailXtender to help unlock the complexity that accompanies email retention compliance, while small- to-medium sized businesses invested in EMC Dantz Retrospect data protection software to easily administer and receive fast, reliable backups and restores.
 
Services growth in the second quarter continued to be driven by professional services, which has become an integral part of the value EMC delivers to customers. EMC Consulting engagements in the quarter were driven by customers under pressure to respond to compliance demands, implement tiered information infrastructures, and classify information to better align IT resources with business requirements.
 
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, achieved record quarterly revenues of $91 million in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 93%, making it one of the fastest-growing major software businesses in the world. Software license revenues were up 70% over the year-ago quarter on a record number of orders. Services, including maintenance and consulting, increased nearly 200%. VMware's revenue growth was driven by the proliferation of virtual infrastructure into x86 environments as customers deployed VMware products for server consolidation and containment, business continuity, test/development and the enterprise desktop. VMware software partners BEA Systems, MySQL AB, Novell and Red Hat joined Oracle Corporation in distributing their software via VMware virtual machines.

Item 8.01 Other Events
 
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the board of directors of EMC Corporation ("EMC") has approved in principle a long term incentive program for certain senior executives of EMC (the "Executive LTIP"). The program is comprised of equity awards intended to drive performance and promote retention, while also being cost efficient.
 
The Committee has also decided to continue to use the traditional equity awards, stock options and restricted stock grants it has made in the past, in conjunction with the Executive LTIP. The senior executive equity program has therefore been designed with a blend of traditional equity awards and the Executive LTIP.
 
The Committee may modify the proposed blend of equity awards to be granted in the event that the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R regarding mandatory expensing of equity awards does not become effective as of January 2006.
 
Executive LTIP
 
As part of the Executive LTIP, the Committee awarded 750,000 performance shares under EMC's 2003 Stock Plan (the "Plan") to one executive officer effective July 22, 2005. These shares will vest in the event that certain earnings per share targets have been met prior to specified dates. If the targets are not achieved, the performance shares will be forfeited.
 
The Committee intends to award performance shares to certain other executives of the Corporation in late 2005 or early 2006. These shares will not vest unless certain financial targets approved by the Committee at the time of the grant have been met, and will be forfeited if the targets are not achieved. The Committee expects to determine whether such targets have been met in January 2009.
 
EMC intends for compensation realized upon the vesting of the performance shares to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
Traditional Awards
 
Options
 
Effective July 22, 2005, the Committee granted options to acquire an aggregate of 4,910,000 shares of EMC common stock under the Plan to certain executive officers. These options will vest pro rata over five years.
 
Restricted Stock
 
Effective July 22, 2005, the Committee awarded an aggregate of 650,000 shares of restricted stock to two executive officers. These shares will vest fully on specified dates, but may vest on an accelerated basis if certain performance targets are met at specified times prior to such dates.
 
The Committee also intends to award additional shares of restricted stock under the Plan to certain executives in late 2005 or early 2006. These shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, but may vest on an accelerated basis if certain earnings per share targets are met at specified times prior to such date.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  October 19, 2005  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2005, achieving double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for the ninth consecutive quarter. EMC's third quarter growth was driven by its expanding services business, market-leading mid-tier storage systems, software for enterprise content management and backup, recovery and archive, and VMware's virtual infrastructure software.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's third quarter was $2.37 billion, 17% higher than the $2.03 billion reported for the third quarter of 2004. Earnings per diluted share were $0.17, including $0.04 from a tax-related benefit, compared with $0.09 per diluted share reported for the year-ago quarter. Net income for the quarter was $422 million, including $106 million from a tax-related benefit, compared with $218 million reported for the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the tax-related benefit in the third quarter of 2005, earnings per diluted share were $0.13, up 44% from the year-ago quarter.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC's President and CEO, said, "Few companies in our industry have been able to match the record of consistency and execution that EMC has achieved so far this year. Each of our major business segments and geographies continued to grow by double-digits during the third quarter, reflecting the power of our model, the soundness of our strategy and the excitement customers have about our expanding portfolio of solutions. We are in the midst of the most robust wave of new product introductions in our history, and customer response to our new products has been outstanding."
 
"With each passing quarter," continued Tucci, "information lifecycle management (ILM) is being adopted by more and more customers who see it as the most logical and efficient way to maximize the value of their information, answer the demands of compliance and get their IT costs under control. In the information infrastructure marketplace, our platforms and software are second to none, as is our ability to combine these products with consulting services to create complete ILM solutions."
 
Systems revenue grew 15% in the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter, to $1.09 billion. EMC grew its software license and maintenance revenues 16% to $865 million,
representing 37% of total EMC revenues. Professional services, systems maintenance, and other services revenue, which represented revenue from EMC's fastest-growing business line for the second consecutive quarter, grew 25% to $402 million.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "We again outperformed the market, while driving our level of profitability higher. Our twelfth straight quarter of meeting or exceeding our major financial targets was marked by continued operating leverage, solid cash flow and better than expected bottom-line results. We significantly stepped up our stock buy-back efforts by spending $333 million on more than 24 million shares in the third quarter and will continue to be very active in the market again in the current quarter."
 
Third Quarter Highlights
 
EMC platforms and related software revenue had double-digit growth in the third quarter, driven by demand for EMC's mid-tier networked storage systems including EMC CLARiiON, EMC Celerra and EMC Centera. During the quarter EMC introduced new versions of its EMC Symmetrix and CLARiiON networked storage systems, providing customers with an unparalleled range of tiered information storage functionality and performance. Interest in the new platforms was high, suggesting strong demand for the new Symmetrix and CLARiiON systems during the current fourth quarter, their first full quarter of general availability.
 
EMC multi-platform software revenue also had double-digit revenue growth during the quarter, led by backup, recovery and archive software license revenue, which increased 39% over the comparable prior-year period. EMC again saw strong demand for EMC Legato NetWorker, EMC EmailXtender and EMC Replication Manager as customers continued to place a priority on information protection and compliance. Content management software also delivered double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter as customers deployed the EMC Documentum enterprise content management platform to manage their growing volumes of unstructured information.
 
Services revenue growth of 25% was driven by professional services engagements as customers sought help to plan, build, manage and support their ILM implementations. Professional services engagements involving data classification, migration and consolidation, along with business continuity, increased as customers enlisted EMC Consulting to aid in the management and protection of their increasingly complex information infrastructures.
 
VMware achieved record quarterly revenues in the third quarter, exceeding $100 million for the first time in its history and continuing to be one of the fastest-growing major software businesses in the world. The EMC subsidiary showed continued growth as customers increasingly standardize on VMware virtual infrastructure for their x86 production environments to solve server consolidation and containment, business continuity, software lifecycle and enterprise desktop computing demands. During the third quarter VMware, in conjunction with 15 partners, introduced two major new initiatives aimed at fostering open virtualization standards and accelerating the availability of the widest possible range of options and support for virtualization. Also during the quarter Sun Microsystems joined Dell, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC and Unisys in offering VMware virtual infrastructure on its servers.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On October 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of EMC Corporation ("EMC") set 2006 annual base salaries for Joseph M. Tucci, Michael C. Ruettgers, William J. Teuber, Jr., David I. Goulden and David B. Wright, each of whom is an EMC named executive officer for 2004, at $1,000,000, $300,000, $600,000, $550,000 and $650,000, respectively. Such annual base salaries are the same for each named executive officer as in 2005, other than for Mr. Ruettgers, whose annual base salary has been reduced in connection with his employment arrangement with EMC as described below in Item 5.02.
 
The Compensation Committee also established bonus awards that may be earned for fiscal year 2006 under the EMC Corporation Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") by Messrs. Tucci, Teuber, Goulden and Wright. The aggregate annualized target amounts of the 2006 bonuses that Messrs. Tucci, Teuber, Goulden and Wright may earn are $1,440,000, $400,000, $450,000 and $650,000, respectively, the same as the annualized target amounts of their 2005 bonuses. Each of these executives is eligible to receive semi-annual bonuses based on EMC's profitability and quarterly bonuses based on a mix of EMC, business unit and individual financial, strategic, operational and other performance objectives. The performance goals and the weights assigned to them will vary among these executives depending on the individual's role and responsibilities.
 
The actual bonus payments in 2006 may be less than or greater than the target amounts depending on certain factors. For the semi-annual bonuses and certain of the quarterly bonuses, actual bonus payments will be made based on the extent to which the goals are achieved, with potential upside for exceeding the goals and no payment being made unless a threshold percentage of the goals are achieved. Under certain other quarterly bonuses, actual bonus payments will be based on achievement of the executive's goals and EMC's overall bonus funding level for that quarter. The overall funding level will be based on the extent to which certain EMC financial and strategic objectives are achieved for that quarter.
 
The goals for the 2006 bonuses for Messrs. Tucci, Teuber, Goulden and Wright will be based on one or more of the performance criteria set forth in the Bonus Plan, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our report on Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  October 21, 2005  EMC Corporation, the world leader in information management and storage, today announced that Joe Tucci will become Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2006. Tucci will continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of EMC, a role he has held since January 2001. Mike Ruettgers, who has been EMC's Chairman since January 2001 and has served as an EMC Director since 1992, has resigned from the Board of Directors effective December 31, 2005. He will continue as a Senior Advisor to the EMC Board and management.
 
The EMC Board of Directors also approved the designation of a lead director, to be effective January 1, 2006. David Strohm has been selected by the independent directors to serve as lead director.
 
"Joe Tucci has clearly been the right leader at the right time for EMC," said Ruettgers. "In five years as President and CEO, Joe has led EMC through a remarkable period of transformation, resurgence and success. He has broadened our portfolio through both internal investment and strategic acquisitions that give us the most comprehensive set of information lifecycle management offerings in the world. He has built a deep and talented bench. And he and the people of EMC have now delivered nine straight quarters of double-digit year-to-year revenue growth."
 
Ruettgers, 62, joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001, leading the company in a decade-long trajectory of accelerating profitable growth and market leadership. He was named Executive Chairman in January 2001 and Chairman in January 2004. He has led EMC's proactive corporate governance, focusing on shaping the composition and expertise of EMC's independent and fully engaged Board.
 
"We have been incredibly fortunate to have the benefit of Mike's wisdom and guidance in leading our Board over the past five years," said Tucci. "He has done so much for this industry, and especially for the employees and customers of EMC, through the best of times and the most challenging. He has been a mentor and a friend, and we are very pleased that he will continue to provide his time and advice to us as we move forward."
In announcing David Strohm as EMC's lead director, Ruettgers said, "David has brought new dimensions and insight to our Board over the past two years. As lead director, he will act as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman, and facilitate discussions among the independent directors on key issues and concerns outside of Board meetings. The addition of this role to the EMC Board is good corporate governance practice and positive for EMC and our shareholders."
 
Strohm, 57, is a General Partner with Greylock Partners, one of the largest early-stage venture capital firms in the U.S. He became an EMC Director in October 2003, and is a member of EMC's Compensation and Mergers and Acquisitions Committees.
 
Tucci, 58, joined EMC in January 2000 as President and Chief Operating Officer, ascending to President and CEO a year later. He has overseen the most aggressive new-product introduction cycles in the company's history, led EMC into multi-platform, open software for storage, information and content management, broadened industry alliances and partnerships, and completed more than 20 acquisitions to broaden EMC's market leadership, technology offerings, and growth potential.

Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In July 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the board of directors of EMC Corporation ("EMC") approved in principle a long term incentive program for certain senior executives of EMC (the "Executive LTIP"). The program is comprised of equity awards intended to drive performance and promote retention, while also being cost efficient.
 
On December 5, 2005, the Committee awarded an aggregate of 5,875,000 performance shares under EMC's 2003 Stock Plan (the "Plan") to certain senior executives. 4,700,000 of these performance shares are referred to as Target Shares, and 1,175,000 of these performance shares are referred to as Overachievement Shares.
 
The performance shares awarded in December will vest in the event that a three-year cumulative earnings per share target (the "EPS Goal") approved by the Committee has been met. The Committee expects to determine whether the EPS Goal has been met or exceeded, in full or in part, in January 2009. If earnings per share equal or exceed (i) 90.9% of the EPS Goal, 50% of the Target Shares will vest, (ii) 94.2% of the EPS Goal, 75% of the Target Shares will vest or (iii) 100% of the EPS Goal, 100% of the Target Shares will vest. If earnings per share equal or exceed 106% of the EPS Goal and the holder is continuously employed by EMC through a specified date in January 2010, the Overachievement Shares will also vest. If the targets and conditions set forth above are not achieved, the performance shares awarded in December will be forfeited.
 
EMC intends for compensation realized upon the vesting of the performance shares to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
On December 5, 2005, the Committee also awarded an aggregate of 1,200,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive officers. These shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, but may vest on an accelerated basis if certain earnings per share targets are met at specified times prior to such date.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 6, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported preliminary fourth-quarter and full 2005 fiscal year revenues, exceeding previously announced fourth-quarter revenue expectations and establishing new all-time company record highs for quarterly and full-year revenues.
 
EMC expects to report total consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter between $2.70 billion and $2.71 billion. Excluding certain items discussed below, diluted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be at the high end of EMC's previously announced expectations or $0.17. Consolidated revenues for the full 2005 fiscal year are expected to be between $9.65 billion and $9.66 billion, an increase of 17% over 2004. EMC plans to announce complete fourth-quarter and full-year results on the morning of Tuesday, January 24, 2006.
 
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and CEO, said, "With a great finish to a tremendous year, the people of EMC exceeded revenue expectations in the fourth quarter and delivered record results. We achieved our tenth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth largely because our customers' enthusiasm for information lifecycle management has never been stronger. Organizations around the world are investing in our portfolio of systems, software and services to capture greater value from their information infrastructures and accelerate their businesses to capitalize on the vast opportunities of this information-rich age."
 
EMC completed its acquisition of Captiva Software Corporation ("Captiva") during the fourth quarter and incurred an in-process research and development charge of approximately $14 million.
 
In the fourth quarter EMC also completed the repatriation of accumulated income earned abroad. EMC repatriated approximately $3.0 billion, resulting in a fourth-quarter 2005 income tax charge. The impact of this charge is expected to be approximately $175 million.
 
On December 30, 2005, EMC approved a plan to rebalance its workforce, which will result in increased focus on new product development and the company's ability to target, reach and
support more customers around the globe. During 2006 approximately 1,000 positions will be affected as the company expands its sales coverage around the world and grows its product development team. The adjustments are expected to be complete by the end of 2006 and will result in a fourth-quarter 2005 cash charge of approximately $80 million to cover the cost of employee separation benefits.
 
Tucci continued, "The best companies preserve their leadership by looking out to the horizon and making adjustments today to position themselves for shifts in customers' expectations and market dynamics. Our business model and organizational structure continue to evolve as we integrate new acquisitions, expand into new markets and address more of our customers' information infrastructure needs. While we continue to focus on improving our overall cost efficiencies, we also plan to utilize this rebalancing to invest in sales and R&D in order to accelerate our innovation engine to capture an even greater share of our expanding market opportunity."
 
The charges related to closing the acquisition of Captiva, repatriation and the workforce rebalancing are expected to be approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2005 are expected to be approximately $0.06.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 24, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported strong fourth quarter and full fiscal year financial results for 2005, establishing new company records for quarterly and full year revenues.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's fourth quarter was $2.71 billion, 15% higher than the $2.36 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding the fourth quarter charges discussed below, net income for the quarter grew 27% to $409 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with $321 million or $0.13 per diluted share reported for the fourth quarter of 2004. Including these charges, net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
 
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2005 fiscal year was $9.66 billion, 17% higher than the $8.23 billion reported for the full 2004 fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year, excluding the special items discussed below, grew 47% to $0.53. Including these items, net income for the year grew 30% to $1.1 billion or $0.47 per diluted share.
 
Joe Tucci, Chairman, President and CEO of EMC, said, "We closed a record year with a record quarter. Our combined software businesses had their first billion-dollar quarter and our market-leading midrange storage systems had their best quarter ever.
 
"In 2005 we invested more than a billion dollars in research and development to make information lifecycle management really come alive for customers. We will continue our aggressive rollout of new products in 2006 to help organizations around the world tackle relentless information growth, improve productivity, lower technology and operational costs, and simplify their information infrastructures.
 
"With 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth behind us, we fully expect our momentum and level of execution to continue into 2006 and beyond. During the year our platforms and our portfolio of software and services will continue to expand to address new markets and customer priorities. With information technology utilization rates at record highs and capital
expenditures approaching record lows, we expect even stronger interest among our customers for these new offerings and the value they provide."
 
Systems revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago quarter, to $1.3 billion. EMC grew its software license and maintenance revenues 16% to a record $1.0 billion during the quarter. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 4% to $403 million.
 
EMC had double-digit revenue growth across each of its major geographies during the quarter. International revenue growth outpaced revenue growth in North America as EMC continued to benefit from investments made in regions where the company has been traditionally under-represented.
 
Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "It was a quarter and year of billions. In addition to reaching a billion dollars in quarterly software revenues and spending more than a billion dollars during the year on R&D, we bought back more than $1 billion of our stock during the year. We also invested nearly $700 million of cash in several strategic acquisitions in 2005, further strengthening our core business and expanding EMC into new, adjacent markets."
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
Within EMC's systems business, midrange platforms grew revenues 32% compared to the year ago quarter as new products and tighter enterprise application integration drove record revenues for the EMC CLARiiON, EMC Centera and EMC Celerra lines. EMC's NAS revenues increased nearly 50% during the quarter compared to the year ago quarter. EMC Symmetrix revenue was up 19% from the third quarter of 2005 on strong demand for the recently introduced DMX 3 platform. The new DMX system sold out in the fourth quarter and represented more than a third of all Symmetrix systems sold.
 
EMC multi-platform software revenue grew by double-digits during the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, led by record sales of EMC Documentum, EMC NetWorker, EMC Retrospect and EMC Smarts software. Content management software license revenue grew 25% as customers deployed the EMC Documentum enterprise content management platform to manage their growing volumes of unstructured information. Backup, recovery and archive software license revenue also grew by double-digits as customers continued to place a priority on information protection and compliance. And resource management software revenues expanded as customers continued to adopt EMC Smarts as their core IT analysis and impact assessment software.
 
VMware achieved record quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter, growing revenue 62% compared to the year ago quarter. The EMC subsidiary showed continued growth as customers increasingly standardize on VMware virtual infrastructure for their x86 production environments. During the quarter VMware introduced the new ESX Server 3, with data center capabilities for larger enterprise workloads and expanded low cost storage support; VirtualCenter 2, with Distributed Resource Scheduling; and VMware Player, a free product that enables personal computer users to easily run any virtual machine on a Windows or Linux personal computer. There have been more than 700,000 downloads of VMware Player and more than 150,000 of the browser
appliance that runs on it. Also during the quarter more than 60 leading operating system, database, application server, enterprise application, management and infrastructure software vendors announced they support their software applications in VMware virtual infrastructure environments.
 
2005 Highlights
 
EMC had double-digit revenue growth across all major business lines in 2005 as customers and partners deployed information lifecycle management strategies and embraced the company's expanding lineup of systems, software and services.
 
Systems revenue grew 16% during the year, helped by additions and enhancements to EMC's entire line of networked storage platforms. Total software revenue, including license and maintenance revenue, grew 20% to a record $3.58 billion as organizations turned to EMC's software portfolio to manage, protect, secure, move and share information. Services revenues grew 20% in 2005, as more and more customers engaged EMC professionals to help plan, build, manage and support ILM implementations.
 
Special Items
 
During the fourth quarter EMC incurred several special charges including a $14 million in-process research and development charge related to closing its acquisition of Captiva Software Corporation; a $180 million charge for income taxes related to the repatriation of approximately $3 billion of accumulated income earned abroad; and an $80 million charge for the approval of a plan to rebalance approximately 1,000 positions within its workforce. During the third quarter EMC had a $106 million favorable benefit from an income tax settlement. Excluding the after tax impact of these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for the fourth quarter and $0.53 for the year.

This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (ix) war or acts of terrorism; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
 
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of EMC's financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the text of this release or in the table entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Net Income" attached to this release. EMC's non-GAAP measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Specifically, the following special items are excluded from certain of the non-GAAP financial measures, as detailed in this release:
 
 
 
 
 
EMC's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of its comparative operating performance (when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect the underlying economics of EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Such comparisons may be more meaningful because operating results presented under GAAP may include, from time to time, items that are not necessarily relevant to understand EMC's business and may, in some cases, be difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that impact EMC's operations. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

(2) The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors acts with respect thereto.

disinterested directors then in office, provided that there has been obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal counsel to the effect that such director or officer appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such individual's action was in the best interests of the corporation; or (c) by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock at the time entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, exclusive of any stock owned by any interested director or officer. Expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by any director or officer in connection with the defense or disposition of any such action, suit or other proceeding may be paid from time to time by the corporation in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by such director or officer to repay to the corporation the amounts so paid by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that indemnification for such expenses is not authorized under this Section 7. The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled. As used in this Section, the terms, "director" and "officer" include their respective heirs, executors and administrators, and an "interested" director or officer is one against whom in such capacity the proceedings in question or another proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then pending. Nothing contained in this Section shall affect any rights to indemnification to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law.
 
 
The seal of the corporation shall, subject to alteration by the directors, consist of a flat-faced circular die with the word "Massachusetts", together with the name of the corporation and the year of its organization, cut or engraved thereon.
 
 
Except as the directors may generally or in particular cases authorize the execution thereof in some other manner, all deeds, leases, transfers, contracts, bonds, notes, checks, drafts and other obligations made, accepted or endorsed by the corporation shall be signed by the president or by one of the vice presidents or by the treasurer.
 
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on December 31.
 
 
These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose, of which the notice shall specify the subject matter of the proposed alteration, amendment or repeal or the sections to be affected thereby, by vote of the shareholders. These bylaws may also be altered,
 
amended or repealed by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, except that the directors shall not take any action which provides for indemnification of directors nor any action to amend this Section 11, and except that the directors shall not take any action unless permitted by law.
 
Any bylaw so altered, amended or repealed by the directors may be further altered or amended or reinstated by the shareholders in the above manner.
 
 
The provisions of Chapter 110D shall not apply to control share acquisitions of the corporation.
 
If the provisions of Chapter 110D shall become applicable to control share acquisitions of the corporation through amendment of these bylaws or otherwise, the following provisions shall apply:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
made a control share acquisition shall be deemed to have been duly given.
 
 
References in this Section to Chapter 110D mean Chapter 110D of the Massachusetts General Laws as in effect from time to time.
 
 
The provisions of Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws shall not apply to "business combinations" (as defined therein) involving the corporation.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 20, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported record first-quarter revenues on increased demand for its new family of high-end networked EMC Symmetrix storage systems, EMC Documentum content management software, EMC Smarts resource management software and VMware virtual infrastructure software.
First Quarter Financial Results
 
 
 
Additional information about EMC's net income is included within the supplemental tables released with today's first-quarter financial announcement.
Joe Tucci, Chairman, President and CEO of EMC, said, "The power of our balanced, solutions-focused business model is evident. Our sustained focus on information lifecycle management (ILM) and expanding portfolio of best-in-class products and services enabled us to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the 11th quarter in a row.
"Our business continues to be rich with opportunity," Tucci continued. "We have the strongest new product lineup in our history, and this aggressive rollout will continue at a fast pace as the year unfolds. At the same time, we are making major inroads into emerging areas like unified ILM, virtualization, model-based resource management and information security. Together, these new, exciting solutions are enabling us to engage customers at a more strategic level and help them transform the way they build, manage and realize more value from their information infrastructures."
Systems revenue in the first quarter was $1.23 billion, a 20% increase over the year-ago quarter, giving EMC its strongest quarterly systems revenue growth rate in more than two years. EMC had double-digit software license and maintenance revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter, increasing revenues 11% to $925 million. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 6% year over year to $396 million.
EMC completed the first quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and investments. Year-to-date the company has purchased approximately $375 million in EMC stock in the open market and redeemed $125 million in convertible debt. Earlier this week, EMC's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional 250 million shares of EMC common stock.
"When you consider its price relative to the opportunity, EMC stock at these levels continues to be one of the best values in the market," said Bill Teuber, EMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We plan to purchase another $2.5 billion worth of stock through the rest of this year, deploying $3 billion toward share reduction in 2006  three times our 2005 investment. These investments, along with our continued interest in strategic, growth-oriented acquisitions, are part of our expanded commitment to increase our addressable market and drive shareholder value by leveraging our strong cash position."
First Quarter Highlights
EMC's strong, double-digit systems revenue growth was driven by solid demand for the new Symmetrix DMX-3 family of tiered networked storage. Sales of the new DMX-3 made up more than half of the total Symmetrix systems revenues during the quarter, as customers increasingly deployed the most scalable, highest-performance system available in the marketplace today.
EMC multi-platform software revenue growth was led by record sales of enterprise content management software. Excluding acquisition impact, enterprise content management software license revenue grew approximately 30% compared with the year-ago quarter, driven by rapid growth of unstructured information and improved synergy between EMC's traditional and software-focused sales forces. Smarts software also surged during the quarter as customers continue to transition to model-based resource management to pinpoint service-affecting problems automatically and calculate the impact of those problems in real time without human intervention.
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, again achieved record quarterly revenues, growing sales 64% year over year to $131 million during the first quarter. VMware showed continued growth as customers increasingly standardize on its enterprise-class suite of virtual infrastructure products. During the quarter, VMware introduced VMware Server (the successor to GSX Server) and made it freely available to accelerate mainstream adoption of virtualization. VMware Server is the first commercially available server virtualization product with support for 64-bit virtual machines and Intel Virtualization Technology. During the quarter VMware also continued to win top accolades in the industry, with its innovation and technology leadership being recognized by and .

This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (ix) war or acts of terrorism; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of EMC's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the text of this release or in the tables entitled "Income Statement Adjusted to exclude Stock Option Expense," "Quarterly Non-GAAP Income Statement Trend," "Reconciliation of GAAP Income Statement to a Non-GAAP Income Statement" for various periods and "Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Net Income per Weighted Average Share had the Provisions of FAS No. 123 been Adopted in 2005" attached to this release. EMC's non-GAAP measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Specifically, stock option expense is excluded from each non-GAAP financial measure in this release. Restricted stock expense and intangible amortization are also excluded from certain of the non-GAAP financial measures detailed in this release or the attached tables. Management views these items as non-cash expenses that are reported internally as corporate expenses. In addition, in some cases where specified, restructuring and other special items are excluded from net income and earnings per share. For purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals, EMC's management uses financial statements that do not include such items.
 
EMC's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect the underlying economics of EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Such comparisons may be more meaningful because operating results presented under GAAP may include, from time to time, items that are not necessarily relevant to understand EMC's business and may, in some cases, be difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. One material limitation of a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation is that it does not reflect any benefit that such compensation may confer on EMC. Management compensates for this and other limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: In 2005, we elected to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans. The above table provides a reconciliation of net income and diluted net income per weighted average share had we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" for the periods presented. Certain amounts may not add due to rounding. The 2005 amounts have been adjusted to be calculated following the same method that will be utilized under FAS No. 123R consistent with the presentation in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
* Excluding restructuring and other special charges and special tax items, diluted EPS was $0.53 for 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HOPKINTON and BEDFORD, Mass  June 29, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the leader in information management and storage, and RSA Security Inc. (NASDAQ:RSAS), the leader in protecting and managing identities and digital assets, today announced a definitive agreement for EMC to acquire RSA. Under the terms of the agreement, EMC will pay $28.00 per share in cash in exchange for each share of RSA and the assumption of outstanding options, for an aggregate purchase price of slightly less than $2.1 billion, net of RSA's existing cash balance. EMC's acquisition of RSA brings together two market leaders with a shared vision for helping organizations of all sizes securely manage their information throughout its lifecycle. The acquisition adds industry-leading identity and access management solutions and encryption and key management software to EMC's expanding, information-centric security portfolio. The acquisition is expected to be completed late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2006, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Joe Tucci, EMC's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Information security is a top priority among executives around the world, and it has become an inseparable attribute of information management. Businesses can't secure what they don't manage, and when it comes to securing information, that means simply two things  managing the data and managing access to the data. EMC is the leading provider of information management solutions. Bringing RSA into the fold provides EMC with industry-leading identity and access management technologies and best-in-class encryption and key management software to help EMC deliver information lifecycle management securely."
RSA provides technologies to secure information no matter where it resides or travels inside or outside of an organization and throughout its lifecycle. With industry-leading authentication, access control, and encryption solutions, RSA helps organizations of all sizes ensure the authenticity and protection of people, information and transactions.
"This acquisition signals a fundamental change in the landscape of the security market," continued Tucci. "EMC is 100% committed to applying the resources required to continue to expand RSA's leading market share while also tightly integrating their technology with EMC's products to bring customers the best information-centric security portfolio available."
According to recent surveys conducted by industry and financial analyst firms, information security is the number one priority among CIOs. Meanwhile, 75% of U.S. companies suffer data loss each year. With high profile data breaches garnering national coverage and pressure to meet regulatory compliance, the combination of RSA's security offerings and EMC's information management and storage solutions uniquely addresses the market's rapidly growing need for information-centric security.
EMC's information-centric security strategy implements an integrated, four-part solution that secures information throughout its lifecycle. The strategy helps customers assess the security of their information, secure their information infrastructure, directly protect their sensitive information, and manage security information and events to assure effectiveness and ease the burdens of compliance. The integration of RSA's authentication and access management capabilities will build on EMC's foundation of inherently secure products and processes. RSA's encryption and key management technology will be central to EMC's strategy to directly protect the information no matter where it resides within or outside of an organization.
Art Coviello, RSA CEO and President, said, "Information security threats are evolving from attacks on the network and the perimeter to attacks on the data itself. These attacks are designed to obtain information, intellectual property and other information that can be exploited for criminal gain. For this reason, security must be an integral part of the information infrastructure, transparently allowing authorized users to easily get access to information. The combination of RSA's leading security technology coupled with EMC's best-in-class information infrastructure and financial resources will accelerate the integration of security into the information infrastructure."
On a GAAP basis, EMC currently expects the acquisition of RSA will be dilutive by $.03 per diluted share in 2007 and will not have a material impact on diluted earnings per share in 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of intangible amortization and stock option expense, EMC currently expects the acquisition will not have a material impact on diluted earnings per share in 2007 and will be accretive to earnings by $.03 per diluted share in 2008.
Upon completion of the acquisition, RSA will operate as EMC's Information Security Division, headquartered in Bedford, Mass. Art Coviello will become an Executive Vice President of EMC and President of the division.
Conference Call & Webcast
EMC Chairman, President and CEO Joe Tucci, RSA CEO and President Art Coviello, and EMC Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Bill Teuber will discuss the acquisition on a conference call for financial analysts, investors and the news media at 5:15 p.m. EDT, today. The dial-in number is 210-234-0104. The pass code to access the call is EMC. For the general public, the call will be webcast with supporting slides at EMC and RSA's home pages, and .

This release contains "forward-looking statements", including forward-looking statements under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of closing, integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies associated with the acquisition; (ii) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (iii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (ix) war or acts of terrorism; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's and RSA's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC and RSA disclaim any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of EMC's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the text of this release. EMC's non-GAAP measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Specifically, intangible amortization and stock option expense is excluded from each non-GAAP financial measure in this release. Management views these items as non-cash expenses that are reported internally as corporate expenses. For purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals, EMC's management uses financial statements that do not include such items.
EMC's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect the underlying economics of EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Such comparisons may be more meaningful because operating results presented under GAAP may include, from time to time, items that are not necessarily relevant to understand EMC's business and may, in some cases, be difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. One material limitation of a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes intangible amortization and stock option expense is that it does not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for this and other limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC

With that, it is now pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Thanks, Tony, and welcome and thank all of you for joining us on today's call. It's an exciting day for us, and I'd like to first officially welcome RSA. We are incredibly pleased to have announced this integration with RSA, and we think it's going to be a tremendous asset to EMC, going forward. Let me put this in a little perspective for you -- over the last several meetings we've had with analysts and investors and, most notably, I'm pointing to our Analyst Day this past June 7th in New York City, we talked about EMC's evolution from a storage company to a storage and information management company, to where we're classifying ourselves today as an information infrastructure company. And, indeed, the vast majority of this transformation from a storage company to an information infrastructure company actually happened over the last three years. We talked about EMC's stack of technology and focused on our information lifecycle management offerings of hardware and software starting with our tiered storage, our protection software that goes from backup and tape to more efficient and effective disk backup and disk replication. We talked about how we have data mobility storage and how storage virtualization, our Invista product was going to revolutionize that layer of information software. We talked about our leadership position in archiving software and how we're going to unify that with a common archive and retrieval system. We talked about how most of information, more than 70%, is unstructured and how that's being managed with our content management software; putting this information into repositories and then making sure we manage that properly with checkin/checkout version control and digital rights management, et cetera. And then, of course, we talked about the coming, which we'll have at the end of this year, our intelligent information management software layer, which will feature data classification; we'll build out a metadata engine and around that we'll be able to set and automate management policies around this information. We talked about how to manage the information lifecycle management stack in conjunction with other assets in your infrastructure, what we were doing in resource management; we talked about how virtualization was basically game-changing and wrapping that around with services is how we have now categorized our information infrastructure strategy. We talked about how the EMC storage business is strong and growing; we talked about our plan over the next several years to sustain double-digit growth, and we talked about EMC's goal to grow five businesses -- five business areas into the $1 billion mark over the next several years. I mentioned these business areas were VMware infrastructure, which, obviously, would have VMware as a foundation. I've talked about content management, which would actually have Documentum and Captiva and several other acquisitions as the foundation. We talked about resource management being one of those $1 billion goals, which would have Smarts and the SRM Control Center family as a base foundation. We talked about storage virtualization being another one of these $1 billion opportunities for us with Invista and Rainfinity as the foundation. We also talked about our goal for information security and, of course, at that time the EMC, I was honest, had a small amount of revenue in that space and, of course, now as we talk through this, you can see how with RSA Security joining the EMC family, we will have the opportunity to grow that fact on a kind of a little bit of a pro forma basis, so to speak. We would expect this business in 2007 to start out at about a $500 million run rate, which would be the RSA business plus growth plus some of the EMC pieces that we also have in the security area. 3
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security So you can see, we are well underway. All these businesses are at least $500 million in size, larger, they are growing at substantial double-digit rates and, hopefully, you can see now, as the strategy is fleshed out, we have this opportunity of building these five new $1 billion businesses more relevant than ever. When you think of security of information, we have mentioned many times that as you look at IT surveys done by almost every single surveyor out there, security always makes the top of the list. As a matter of fact, security and storage usually dominate the top of this list and, again, being -- having a strong position in both of those, we think will bode well for us in the future. I want to talk about -- we talked about acquisitions in the past, and I've always said we have a disciplined, focused, acquisition strategy. I've categorized our strategy as a bit of a string of pearls. These are, as you see, from a 2006 size, the expectation from the market is that RSA would be about $375 million in size. It is a leader in what it does, and I think you can see that's a continuation of my pledge that I'd rather do something larger, a merger of equal is totally game-changing to continue to move our strategy forward with a very disciplined string-of-pearls approach. You know that we're kind of famous for detailed plans on exactly how we're going to bring whoever we acquire into the EMC family and make sure we maintain the talent that we bring in and make sure that we create the leverage to this. I've also told you that EMC, if we pull off the two strategies I talked about earlier -- one, of continuing to grow our core storage business in double digits as well as build these five new $1 billion businesses over the next several years -- that would mean over the next several years we'd have a growth rate in the mid-teens. I also said it was my kind of druthers and certainly my drive to buy a business that was growing faster than the mid-teens. And, if you look at RSA as according to some of the analysts out there, even a stand-alone, the expectation is to have a CAGR over the next three years of over 20%, and we absolutely believe that inside the EMC family with the leverage we create and talk to you about today, that will go up from there. Obviously, any acquisition we do -- we need to have strategic to be core to our storage and our information infrastructure focus, and here, to me, the mandate is clear by our customers and the technology itself. We need to make sure that the information itself is protected; we need to make sure it can be encrypted; we need to be able to encrypt the rest in flight, online, on disk, on tape, across networks -- in other words, wherever digital information lives. We need to do that. We need centralized key management software, and we have to provide identity management and control and authorize access to that information. These are the things that RSA brings to EMC. In short, we fundamentally and deeply believe that the technology company that seamlessly integrates information storage with information management, with information protection, with information security, and centrally manages and orchestrates this information infrastructure will be a huge winner in the technology marketplace, and the technology that's going to do that is EMC. EMC is where information lives and tomorrow you will see that it will be where information lives securely. With that, let me hand it over to Dennis Hoffman, and he'll put a little more meat on the bones and then, of course, I hope Art puts a little more meat on the bones after that, and then Bill will talk about some of the financing aspects. Dennis? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dennis Hoffman - EMC - VP Information Security Thanks, Joe. The simple truth of information security is that no one really thinks their data is safe. The focus and the threat has clearly shifted, and the financial legal implications of data loss and data theft are enormous. The reasons are twofold. First, today's information security solutions are insufficient to address this shifting threat. They protect resources like networks, servers, and laptops. They protect proxies for information not the information itself, and they attempt to establish perimeters. Second, information lives, and it moves. It's in constant motion through its lifecycle, whether that's in the form of an e-mail, a backup tape, or a laptop walking out the door every night. In short, information leaves the perimeter, and when it does it leaves its security behind. So the approach to securing information needs to change fundamentally. It's clear that information security is becoming an information management problem. It's changing from network-focused and perimeter-centric to data-focused and information-centric, and organizations of all sizes are realizing they simply can't secure what they don't manage. The strategy, which we've previously articulated, is aimed at addressing this very challenge, comprised of four integrated elements. First, assessing the security of information; second, securing the information infrastructure that holds it; third, moving beyond the security of the infrastructure to actually, more directly protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data itself. 4
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security And, finally, closing the loop on this process by assuring policy compliance in a way that doesn't kill organizations with regulation compliance. The foundation of this strategy is securing the information infrastructure and protecting the data. To secure the information, you have to secure the data itself, you must secure the user's access to it. That requires authentication, authorization, and encryption seamlessly integrated with the infrastructure that stores and manages the information. Every interaction, transaction, or communication starts with a trusted identity or all the rest of the security measures are wasted and all information is ultimately stored and managed over its lifecycle, or its value is diminished drastically. That's why EMC and RSA are coming together. To tell you more about that, I'd like to introduce Art Coviello, President and CEO, RSA Security. Art? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO Thanks, Dennis. First, I'd like to say on behalf of all RSA employees that we're thrilled to become part of EMC. We'll be able to fulfill our vision of protecting online identities and digital assets while leveraging the financial strength of EMC but, more important, EMC's solution and expertise information lifecycle management. You know, security has evolved as an independent industry because security was not designed in as IT infrastructure and the Internet were developed. It has become increasingly clear to us due to the changing nature of security threats as well as the evolution of the Web and ubiquitous access to information that security has to be part of the information infrastructure. The combination of EMC and RSA will be of tremendous value to our joint customers because, together, we are the only company with the people, technology, and solutions to be able to achieve this vision. I'm enormously proud of our record of innovation and accomplishments over our 20-year history. Our record annual revenue of $310 million in '05 was followed in Q1 of '06 with a 30% year-over-year growth in orders netting better than 20% growth in revenue. Picking up on Dennis's comments -- securing information is about managing the relationship between people and data. Managing access to data, the people side, requires that we authenticate users, establish and manage their identity, authorize what they can and can't do, and maintain a record of what they have done -- audit. In addition, we need to secure data wherever it resides as it moves throughout its lifecycle. To do this, we need to encrypt the data and manage the encryption keys used to encrypt that data. RSA provides the technology to meet both of these needs and support the core parts of EMC's information-centric security strategy. How do we accomplish this? In short, we bring the industry's leading solutions for enterprise security, consumer protection, and data protection. I am now going to take you briefly through each of those solution groups beginning with enterprise solutions. Our enterprise solutions focus on protecting and leveraging trusted identities. In this day and age, as Dennis mentioned, a digital identity is the starting point for communication, interaction, and transactions that take place electronically. RSA's focus is in making sure that all those digital identities can be trusted. RSA's Secure ID is the industry-leading one-time password authentication in multiple form factors including tokens, USB devices as well as capability on PDAs and cell phones offering organizations and their users a wide range of options depending on the level of convenience and security desired. Our RSA Secure ID solutions ensure the authenticity of the users as they access data and take part in transactions. On the back end, we offer truly differentiated authentication management that can support large-scale deployments across organizations of any size. But what value does a trust identity have in isolation? Absolutely none. It needs to interact with the world around it. It needs to access corporate data; it needs to get e-mail; it needs to transact online; it needs to be leveraged or, better yet, the identity needs to be empowered to do useful things and here we have a broad range of solutions for our customers including our access manager to enable single sign-on and access management for Web apps, RSA sign-on manager for single sign-on within the enterprise, and RSA federated identity manager for across domain, single sign-on in the form of Identity Federation. There are obvious synergies with EMC in this area. Quite simply, RSA is able to offer EMC customers the ability to ensure that only authorized users gain access to corporate information, and RSA solutions can make access to this information even easier without compromising security. In addition to our enterprise solutions, we offer the industry's leading authentication solutions for consumer-facing companies to protect online transactions and the identities of the people behind those transactions. These RSA consumer solutions guard against identity fraud and theft, phishing, spam attacks by online fraudsters, sophisticated pharming scams and malware, and eroding consumer confidence that results from these online crimes. RSA offers flexible, layered authentication solutions to address varying needs of the consumer market including risk-based site-to-user and one-time password authentication. 5
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security In addition, we have an extensive fraud-monitoring network. Our fraud network is a single repository of fraud patterns that are identified during processing online transactions at 50 of the world's largest financial institutions as well as thousands of smaller ones worldwide. When we spot a fraud attempt, we share the identity of the fraudster across the network thereby preventing cyber criminals from launching the same attack against other businesses. Under EMC, RSA will continue to build and invest in this business as both companies believe that the protection of online consumer identity is a burgeoning business that is just beginning to take off. Finally, our RSA data protection solutions are designed to provide a robust framework for protecting an organization's sensitive data anyplace where data resides, whether it is at rest or in transit. Historically, our data protection solutions have supported traditional commercial software providers as well as embedded security for brand-name hardware providers, and this continues to be a growing business. Additionally, we are increasingly supporting the enterprise data protection needs of some of the largest companies in the world. According to Gartner Group, protecting consumer data is much less expensive than dealing with a security breach in which records are exposed and potentially misused. In addition to protecting data through encryption, customers need to be able to manage the keys, which is arguably the hardest part. At RSA we have the industry's leading key management solutions. So EMC and RSA Security are a natural team to lead the industry in data protection solutions as well. Together, we can enable customers to take a more proactive stance on protecting their information assets and, at the same time, provide them with what they need to comply with the recent regional and vertical mandates such as the U.S., state, breach notification laws, the European Union's Data Privacy Directive; Japan's Personal Information Protection Act, and the payment card industry standard. To summarize, it's time security becomes an integrated part of the information infrastructure. EMC and RSA are the companies best-positioned to accomplish this. Bill? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bill Teuber - EMC - Vice Chairman and CFO Thanks, Art. I'll be walking through a brief summary of the transaction details, our financial expectations, and the organizational structure of EMC's new information security division. First, the transaction summary. It will be an all cash transaction. The current enterprise value of the deal, which is net of RSA's cash of $230 million is slightly less than $2.1 billion, or $28 a share. Pending the appropriate approvals, we expect this transaction to close late Q3 or early of Q4 2006. Turning to our financial expectations, 2007, on a GAAP basis, we anticipate the RSA acquisition to be dilutive to EMC's earnings per share by $0.03. This is primarily due to the foregone interest income on EMC cash, which we'll use to complete the acquisition. We are taking some of the cash we have on our balance sheet and investing it in the business to drive much greater long-term returns for EMC. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding intangible amortization and stock option expense, the RSA acquisition will be neutral to earnings. In 2008 we anticipate the acquisition to be neutral to GAAP EPS and accretive by $0.03 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Once the acquisition is finalized, RSA will operate as EMC's new Information Security Division. Art Coviello will become and Executive Vice President of EMC and the President of the Information Security Division. Going forward, any future security activities and acquisitions will become part of this Information Security Division. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Tony to answer Q&A. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Thanks, Bill. Before we open up the lines for your questions, I'd ask you to limit yourself to one question including clarification. There are a lot of callers on the line including investors and analysts covering each of our companies. We want to be able to answer as many questions as possible from as many stakeholders as possible. Thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Jennifer, can we please open up the lines for questions? 6
QUESTION AND ANSWER FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Thank you, sir. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] Keith Bachman, Banc of America. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keith Bachman - Banc of America - Analyst The words don't seem to match what is suggested by the economics, and I'm not sure how investors can conclude this is a good deal for EMC. You're taking on additional risk by buying a company and their assets. You're getting -- if I use the higher level, it's neutral in '07 and accretive in '08 by a cumulative $0.03. If you took that same [TAS] that you're using to buy back stock, you'd add $0.06, roughly, per year. How is this a good deal for EMC shareholders? The economic realities don't seem to match in any way the strategy that you've outlined. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Well, Keith, first of all, we're going to do both, right? We are still committed, and I think when you see, as we announced the amount of buyback we've done, to date, I think you'll be pleased. So we're going to definitely continue to step up and very committed to buying back our shares. Secondly, we are absolutely convinced that to propel our business into the future and grow, and which would say that if we do this right, I absolutely, positively believe there is upside. But the way information, as I said before, is stored and to integrate protection around that, security around that, is going to be a mandatory, and if you can't do this, your core business will fall off, and to do it right and have a stock that's a lot more powerful, more valuable than our competitors, it's us that will benefit, and their little pieces or slices of technology that will fall off faster. So all that is kind of upside. So the whole name of the game here how do you build continued value for the long shot? So what we're basically saying at this juncture, since, you know, there's still a lot of work to do is let's come in at a what we believe is a conservative case, but as we operate, I think that's how we're going to do it, and we still have plenty of cash flow, plenty of financing capability, to make sure that the buybacks get stepped up. So it wasn't once or no. This was a missing piece in an information infrastructure puzzle, and right now we're focusing. I assure you, we're not in or out. We don't have anything else of size in our sights. There will be, obviously, some little tuck-in acquisitions, put a little bit of technology here and there, but this is something, if we do right, we can distance ourselves. And individual competitive products are not going to win. You need a stock of technology, and the companies that filled out these solid technology stocks are going to be the big winner, and that is the potential, and so the one answer would be and to your point -- all of that opportunity, if we do this correctly, is not built into the models yet. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Aaron Rakers, A.G. Edwards. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards - Analyst Just to build on Keith's comments there, you know, looking at the financials or the valuation of the acquisition, I just want to get a better understanding of the meaningful premium paid for RSA. It looks like about five times estimated revenues, looking out into calendar 2007 -- definitely at the high end, if not above the high end of the range that the company's traded at over the last year. I just want to -- was there a bidding war here that, you know, why such a hefty premium on this name and why at this point? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO 7
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security This piece -- this company and this space is incredibly hot. I pointed out, and those of you that could see the slides -- I showed you the pick list on CIO's minds of where they're going to spend money. As you could see, this kind of technology is at the top and I think, of course, this technology integrated would be at the top top. So integrate into our information infrastructure stock. So obviously there are other companies that noticed this, and to answer your question directly, as I usually do, yes, this was a very competitive situation. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Question please? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Participant Yes, EMC is doing an acquisition. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO What? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Kevin Hunt, Thomas Weisel. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel - Analyst I just want to clarify a couple of things that you had said at your Analyst Day a few weeks ago. First of all, you said the main focus for the company would be on smaller acquisitions. You said you wouldn't do anything above $300 million. Now three weeks later you're doing something well over $300 million for a seemingly very high price. So the first thing I want to have clarified is what's changed, I guess, in three weeks on that. Secondly, in terms of the strategy, the outline on security, you indicated it would be security added in at the various layers of EMC's existing technology. Maybe we just don't know about RSA, but it seems like most of what they do is really in no way integrating with any of EMC's technology. So maybe you could help clarify those two things. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO First of all, Kevin, I think that's not what I said, I mean, I know that's not what I said. What I pointed out, as I said, I wasn't going to do something the merger of equals, game-changing. I said that in the past, and I prefer "string of pearls." I said that in the past the biggest acquisition that EMC did was -- in revenue terms, was Legato at $315 million in the year we bought it, that was their revenue. So I said at that time we did that, our revenues were approximately $6 billion. So at $6 billion we bought a $300 million company. I said now as an $11 billion company, I said, I certainly believe that -- I still want to do something that is not massive in size. I said certainly you could expect this. I hardly think that 375 jumped from 315 when are revenues are up 80% from the time we did Legato is going -- changing my word or the reality or the specificity of my word at all, okay? The other thing is the answer here is some and some, right, in terms of this, and I want to turn it over to Art in a second, but what we're doing on the authentication side and the encryption side, for instance, are directly integrations and, of course, the identity management is a bit of a tag on that when you think of businesses we have in content management and e-room and repository -- I mean -- there's a lot of connectivity right there, but, Art, you can do this better than I can. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO Yeah, no, I think there's a tremendous amount of value. The fact of the matter is, the nature of threats on the Internet and against companies have evolved to direct attacks on data, whether that's identity data, intellectual property, or other information that is designed to achieve some type of 8
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security criminal gain. That means the market is headed our way, because we have the best answer against those types of threats. And because these are attacks on data, it's critically important that where the information lives is tied closely to the security, and that's what this combination will do. You need to secure information itself as well as secure access to the information. You can only do that through authentication and access control and encryption, and those are the technologies and solutions that we bring to EMC. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Brian Freed, Morgan Keegan. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian Freed - Morgan Keegan - Analyst Your detractors are going to say that you made a big acquisition to very weak underlying trends in your core business. Can you talk about trends in your core business and what you see there? And also can you talk a little bit about the DOJ options -- timing and how you've hedged that in your acquisition? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Sure. I don't know, Brian, I mean, we've been very specific on what we wanted to do with the information infrastructure. We've been very specific that tiered storage is important and how strong we are there. We were very specific that protection is and how we're the leader there and how important that is. Data mobility software -- how storage virtualization would [unintelligible] and Rainfinity is going to revolutionize that. What we're doing in archiving and content management and what we will do by the end of the year in information management software. We talked about how the management of resources, instead of domain by domain but more collectively was powerful for us and, of course, what we're doing in virtualization is unparalleled. Basically everything we do has to embed in it a significant piece of information security. We basically said, and I continue to say the core business will grow in double digits for the long term. So there is nothing here that's trying to protect the core business. What we're trying to do is create an information technology stock, which is somewhat expensive but is much more deep and collective. I really believe that, say, just take the storage part of your business -- if you can't have these options for encrypting, so some companies are going to want to encrypt only when it, say, goes to tape, and they're going to wheel it out to Iron Mountain or something. Some companies are going to want encrypted data itself right on the drives, and you can do that with appliances, you can do that - -- we could do that with directors right on the storage, we could do that with software -- all these techniques are going to happen, and all these techniques are going to be necessary and doable and, again, you need technology, and we think the best encryption technology in the industry is with RSA. To do that is really difficult, really difficult to do centralized key management. Again, we believe the best key management on the planet is us. So if we can do that in combination and just pick our storage business, that should -- which is the thing we don't have built in here, right, and that's the opportunity for the future. If I'm right, and I believe I'm right, this will also not only give us the growing RSA business, which we're showing you here, and how that impacts our P&L but it should make our storage business, at the expense of others, grow faster, and I could give you the same thing what's going to happen in protection and data mobility and everything we're doing with content management and resource management and other areas of our technology stock. So it's all about getting stronger, grading your own technology stock and distancing yourself from the competitors that play maybe stronger or only on one line. Art, do you want to add to that? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO I think that, again, if you're going to have the kind of value stack that you're talking about, you're going to need to have a tremendous component not just of encryption and key management but access control. Access control is critical in our own key management solutions; it will be critical in things like content management. So there's tremendous leverage not only from the encryption side of our business but the access control. And at the front end of access control is making sure that you identify whoever it is in the first place that's getting access to the information. 9
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Tell me if I'm wrong -- you were asking about the last part, and you kind of asked it nicely and in code, but let's talk prose here. You wanted to know about the -- inquire about the stock option expensing on our side, was that what you were getting at? Hello? Let's assume that's right so maybe -- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO I'll take that, Joe. So, first of all, we have an SEC inquiry and a DOJ subpoena essentially looking for the same level of information. So right now it's an inquiry and a request for information. I'm comfortable that we've always had strong corporate governance practices. We've applied them consistently, we've strengthened them over the years in conjunction with evolution of law and standards, but I can also tell you that this has not been the least of a management distraction to us, and we're complying fully with the investigation. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bill Teuber - EMC - Vice Chairman and CFO This is Bill. Obviously, we looked at this issue and feel comfortable with RSA's response. Next question, please. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Rebecca Runkle, Morgan Stanley. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley - Analyst Joe, if you could address what you consider the biggest holes in the security platform are, post the RSA acquisition, and then, secondly, just clarify whether or not the deal requires shareholder approval. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO It would obviously -- it's going to require shareholder approval on the RSA side, for sure, and I don't believe -- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley - Analyst But not EMC? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Not on the EMC side, on the RSA side. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bill Teuber - EMC - Vice Chairman and CFO The biggest holes post that -- I mean, I think we've got a pretty complete story. There are elements of the strategy we have yet to execute on, but as I mentioned in my comments that the foundation of the strategy was enhancing the security of the information infrastructure that we sell today, and RSA helps us dramatically across the board with their offering there. And in better protecting data directly, and we've talked at some length about encryption and key management, the one area that we didn't talk about was the EMC common security platform. Underlying the business unit mandate here at EMC to build -- to maximize the inherent security, the products we sell in compliance with a product security policy, we have built, underlying that, a common security platform, which is a single, unified platform to deliver fundamentally a consistent set of security services around authentication, authorization, encryption, and so on. 10
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security RSA's identity management system, or IMS, effort to unify their products on a common architecture will significantly accelerate our ability to do that, and that's another area of integration for us. So with the exception, as Joe mentioned, a couple of developments and possibly a tuck-in here or there, we feel like our strategy is pretty well moving at this point. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Ben Reitzes, UBS. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ben Reitzes - UBS - Analyst I want to expand on a question asked earlier. There's obviously significant concerns in the marketplace about Legato execution in Asia Pacific, even the strength of your new Clarion cycle, and decelerating revenue growth. So now, tomorrow, we are going to be talking about a new deal, a whole new direction, really, even though you've talked about it before. I just want to hear again that you feel confident in your underlying core business, Joe, that we're not going to be surprised by anything short term and long term, and that we should assume that you have the ability to make this deal -- integrate this deal, another deal, seamlessly and go in this direction, create another direction for EMC with everything -- you feel good about where you are? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Let me just take one part of your question, which is near term. It sounds like you're asking us to talk about the quarter. I'm not going to talk about the quarter. As a matter of fact, policy, during the quiet period, not to talk about the quarter, but please join us on July 20th, and we'll fill you in. I do feel that our business is on a good track. We said that last time we got together for our earnings call that we had a couple of areas -- uncharacteristically, we didn't execute well on. We told you the fixes. Some of those fixes are short term; none of those fixes are long term. Some of those fixes might take us beyond one quarter, but we have all those actions in place, and I do believe that we can very seamlessly and quickly do what we want to do and integrate the RSA family into EMC products, and I really don't -- again, I've got to take exception to this -- this is not a totally new [indiscernible] direction. This is -- the vast majority of this is going to be right down the line of what we do, and I think this whole thing is about leverage. The access to the corporate customers in banking and telcos, other financial services, institutions like life and property and casualty insurance companies - -- I mean, these are places where we have great footprints. All these are going to be big, big opportunities for the ID management businesses. And creating this leverage, I mean, I think there is a ton, a ton, of opportunity here for us to create even more upside leverage. So, obviously, we're going to go after the cost side of this with a vengeance, and most of our cost side is in what you might call infrastructure and back office functions, you know, on the sales development. Those are all opportunities for us to create top-line leverage, and that's exactly what we want to do. The most important one -- most important point is customers are going beyond asking us, they are demanding we do this. And they want the security built in not continually bolted on. It's driving them crazy, and that's what's motivating us to do this. You can't take this year or two months' view of this business. I mean, point blank, I mean, I've got to tell you, you will be very pleased, I'm sure, as we report the level of stock purchases, EMC stock purchases that we've done this quarter. I think you'll be pleased with how we're going to continue that in the future and, I've got to tell you, I love our stock at this place, and you're going to see we have enough capital bandwidth and cash flow generation in this company to do both things -- to set ourselves up for the future and make sure that we cut back those numbers of shares outstanding and drive those EPS points back up. And Bill and I and others have, as you know, have based our future compensation on being able to do that, and we will do that. 11
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO I can confirm what Joe said about the leverage. You know, we've always done a good job at the chief security officer level, but increasingly, again because of the nature of the threats and because of our expanding product and solutions portfolio, we've been becoming more and more strategic to enterprises. As a result of that, we have a requirement more and more to call at the CIO level, to be able to have our sales team leverage the EMC major accounts team is an opportunity that I know our field is going to relish, and we're really looking forward to that. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Without trying to be defensive, you picked out a few points that were less than robust last quarter. We have a broad portfolio of products, okay? And we show you basically how we do in that portfolio. As you know, with a portfolio, you have ups and downs, but people get way too focused on some of the downs and not focused at all in the areas that we really had core strength. You didn't mention SIM, you didn't mention content management, you didn't mention VMware, you didn't mention how did in Smarts. We have a great deal of things going well for us. At the same time, you run into bumps in the road every once in a while, and that's not unusual in any business. We just happened to show you where the bumps in the road are, and we're working hard to fix them. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Andrew Neff, Bear Stearns. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns - Analyst I would just like to understand the approach you take in terms of all cash. I mean, just for RSA, you know, doing an all cash deal, I guess the concern is how do you tie these people into the success of EMC? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Obviously, we have to make sure that we have incentives in place for the good people. Part of the deal that we did is we think -- and I'll let Art comment in a second -- that -- I can tell you that Art and his team is incredibly excited about being with us. I'll let Art comment on -- I think we've put enough and appropriate, and we're working on this together, to make sure that we create excitement for the future for, a, individuals like to be part of a successful organization. Together, we can create more success. They want to see their products succeed in the marketplace. We think we can accelerate that and I personally think EMC is not getting recognized for what we can do. I mean, we're saying publicly, and I said it again today, that over the next several years we will and can grow this company in the mid-teens, and we can and will have significant leverage between that growth and the bottom-line growth. So whenever we get believers there, and that will happen as we perform, there will be at some point a great pop in the stock, and that will make everybody thrilled. Why don't you comment, Art? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO I certainly will. I said at the outset that we're very excited and thrilled about the opportunity, and part of it is the way EMC goes about their acquisitions, the ability to continue to pursue our vision with not only the financial leverage but also the information lifecycle management capability and the strategic entrA(C)e that gives us into the enterprise. That's just going to be a tremendous boon to our sales organization. 12
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security So there's significant retention in terms of the stock options that will be assumed. I do have an excited management team. We're on a roll. We've had a hell of a last six months. We know the market's turning our way, and now we get to take full advantage of it. And let me be so bold as to suggest, and I think Joe is alluding to it -- I think, over time, not just with RSA but the collection of all of the technologies and solutions that EMC has been accumulating, you create more value, you create more strategic value to all of your customers and, as a result, each and every product is strengthened, and I think that's the leverage, over time, the string-of-pearl strategy is going to deliver to EMC. I think it makes absolute sense. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Dan Renouard, Robert W. Baird. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Frank Timms - Robert W. Baird - Analyst Actually, this is [Frank Timms] for Dan. Just curious, and you can look at the VMware acquisition and by keeping it kind of a separate entity, you've seen the success there. I'm just curious whether or not you'd consider doing something like that with the RSA acquisition and your thoughts around bringing it in house versus making it a little bit more separate. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO What we're going to do here is not what we did with VMware. You've got to remember, with VMware, as I keep saying, some of our largest and most fierce competitors are some of VMware's biggest partners. We had the opportunity with VMware to create a new layer of technology in the Hypervisor and advanced storage services around that -- software services around that Hypervisor, and, you know, to do that we're doing something very special, which is working exceedingly well. But all I say, like Documentum, first of all, I would say security is probably the best brand in security. So we're definitely not going to throw away that brand. It will be EMC's dedicated, if you will, security business unit. It certainly will have sales capability. It will have a tremendous amount of presales capability. It will have some support capability and, obviously, obviously, development capability. But we're going to make sure that we leverage aggressively the EMC sales force. We're going to make sure that we leverage our infrastructure, whether it's real estate, whether it's IT, whether it's back office functions, finance, et cetera, et cetera. So we are absolutely going to go after -- and Art is as passionate about this as I am -- we're going to go after every dime of cost savings there are, and we've got some targets on the wall, which we will meet, indeed, and then we have what I think are not as aggressive as we need, and we will fix that over time, but I have long learned that it is better to under-promise and over-deliver, and as we get more comfortable, we will give you, hopefully, those revenue synergies which I think are huge, because we will leverage our massive 7,000-person-plus sales force out there, which are calling on exactly the same customers, because these are banks, which need to buy, say, identity management for customers that use online banking. These are medical companies, which need to secure medical information, and so these sales are going to go together. These are two disparately different people. Even in all our sales now, the chief security officer is getting involved. There's mandates that we getting for our -- so by putting -- so this is going to be much more -- much, much, much more integrated and really an integral part of our stock, and VMware is going to be -- you know, continue to run very arm's length like we're doing it. Why? Because it's working fantastic, but that's not the plan here. Art, you got -- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO It would be crazy not to take advantage of the leverage. And at the risk of being a little bit repetitious, we're saying that the security protection for the information infrastructure is getting to be a strategic and critical item at the CIO level. And EMC's strength in similar verticals to ours, whether it's the telco industry, financial services industry, go on and on, will give us tremendous leverage points and, again, at the risk of repeating a little bit, you know, you don't win in technology spending all of your money buying back shares. It can be a great thing to do opportunistically if you think your shares are undervalued, but you only win in technology by growing, and I think we'll be able to add to that growth rate and, again, create more synergy in conjunction with some of the acquisitions that EMC has done. 13

And, secondly, can you remind us what your internal IRR or ROI target is for acquisitions, and tell us what needs to happen for this deal to meet that criteria? Thanks. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Chris, from a synergy standpoint we have, obviously, baked in both top line and expense synergies. I'm not going to say what is which but clearly we expect more top-line synergies, and we think we'll get out of the overall cost base, and we think that there is tremendous top-line synergies here for EMC. We haven't disclosed our internal IRR metrics in the past, and we're not going to do that right now, but we think this is incredibly important and a good acquisition for EMC. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Next question, please. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Erita Clemon - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Hi, this is [Erita Clemon] for Harry. I just wanted to ask if you could talk a little bit about what you'll be getting from the acquisition that you wouldn't from just partnering with RSA. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO RSA wasn't going to be around, that's what we're getting. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Takazawa - EMC - VP Global Investor Relations Okay, next question please. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO I'm not being facetious. I mean, if there's anything that I do wrong that some of you tell me in private is that I'm kind of too blunt and too straight, but that's kind of the way I was built. And, I'm telling you, this is critical technology, critical, and if you think we're the only ones that 14
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security saw that, you're not listening to me, okay? This was very competitive, and this is not -- and then there's a limited number of places you can get this kind of technology, and not having it would put us at a severe disadvantage and, I assure you, others that might have bought this would not want to share it with us. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Brent Bracelin, Pacific Crest Securities. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst Hi, Joe, I certainly appreciate you being straightforward here. I know you touched on this before, but I kind of wanted to follow-up and dig a little deeper on the product overlap and then the sales coverage overlap today. More specifically, how often is RSA directly sold or bundled with storage today, if at all? And then, if not bundled, how long do you think it will take to integrate these technologies and sell this through your sales force as an integrated solution? - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO Let me give that to Art. He's been getting -- from the other side, he sees this better, plus he sees others besides us. And I'll add a little color after that. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO I think Dennis touched on the common security platform from a technology standpoint. We've been developing our identity management system, IMS, now, for two or three years. So we give EMC a substantial leg up. The first iteration of that product should be out the latter part of this year, and that will be our authentication manager. Essentially what the platform does is it enables us to incorporate all of our server products onto one platform with a common user interface, common GUI, common administrative services, and we can leverage that throughout EMC's product line. So we've got obvious development work to get all of our own products on that. By the way, that will include the key management product as well as our access manager and sign-on manager products. So, certainly, that technology integration that will go on over the next couple of years internally with RSA and then across with EMC's products. Again, I think there's more and more of a demand from CIOs to combine technologies to buy from a single vendor, and as the attacks, as I mentioned earlier, continue to evolve to ones that are specifically against data, then the synergy between the two companies will become increasingly apparent. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst Can you just be clear? It sounds like today do you actually bundle the technology with storage or this authentication management product is something that you would, in the future, bundle with storage? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art Coviello - RSA Security - President and CEO Well, the initial discussion we had were about potentially OEMing the technology, and I think EMC's basically just in tune with their own strategy would look at this as the technology they need to own. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Tucci - EMC - Chairman, President, and CEO If we don't have centralized key management, if we don't have strong encryption, if we don't, you know, a number of our businesses get much closer and provide identity management to the information directly. We will put ourselves in a [troubled] position. Having the best technology, we can put ourselves in a market advantage, because we don't believe anybody is going to beat us to the punch here, if we do this properly. And this is what you need to monitor -- how are we doing on this? If we do this properly, which is what our challenge is, and integrate this quickly and properly and get the leverage out of our sales force, it's going to be a phenomenal story, and that's the upside leverage that's not built in. 15
FINAL TRANSCRIPT - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun. 29, 2006/5:50PM, ET, EMC - EMC Acquires RSA Security You know, remember, and it was kind of touched on before, and we talked about it at Analyst Day, those of you that were there, and I think most everybody on the phone here was, you know, that we -- and there's pluses and minuses thrown around about it, and we said from the stage that we put -- our board put a three-year EPS goal in front of us for our compensation, and there was debate whether that was -- EPS was good or not. Obviously, when we do something like this on the short term we're hurting ourselves, right? The best thing I could have done is just do a bunch of buybacks and really play it. But what we're doing is, we're putting this company in the right spot for the long haul, obviously doing this right, there is opportunity to make these results significantly better and have a much longer and much more powerful, competitive company out there. So, again, we are acting in the best -- I believe, since I am a big shareholder, and I have a lot at stake, I am acting in the best interest of the shareholders in doing this because we think this is going to really make us competitive. And, if you think about it, right, we started out this year with 7.4 billion in cash, no debt. They used 2 billion of cash for this. That leaves us with 7.4, but we're going to generate about 2 billion this year. So we're kind of back where we were in the beginning, very committed to being a buyback. It gives us a lot more firepower to do additional buybacks, and we haven't even touched -- haven't even touched the financing opportunities to do more. So basically we're going to play all these things together to continue to drive EPS because I want to make sure that we do both. So I want to position the company properly and drive EPS, and I've got two shots on goal here with RSA -- one is to get that leverage on the top line, make sure those we get those synergies quickly, get that leverage on the top line, and I've achieved what we're showing you here today and, number two, is obviously if we continue to have non-believers, you know, they just continue to go -- buy the hell back out of this stock because -- and we've got plenty of financial leverage to do it. So I didn't see, like, this is a trade-off. And, again, I'm exactly where you want me to be for my motives. I am doing the best thing for this company's shareholders. Great. I think we've said enough. I really appreciate it. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of interest, and we'll be around talking to you in groups, and thank you for your interest, and we will not let you down. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass  July 10, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today announced preliminary results for the second quarter of 2006. Total consolidated revenue for the second quarter was approximately $2.575 billion, an increase of approximately 10% over the second quarter of last year, but lower than EMC's previously announced second quarter revenue expectations of at least $2.66 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 are now expected to be $0.12, including a charge of $0.02 per share for stock option expense, an additional $0.02 expense related to amortization of intangible assets and other equity compensation, and a $0.01 tax benefit received during the quarter. The company's previously announced expectations for second quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.13.
The primary factors impacting EMC's performance in the second quarter included a faster-than-anticipated customer transition to the new EMC Symmetrix DMX-3 platform and later-than-expected orders from customers. While product bookings finished strongly for the quarter, up 14% from the same period a year ago, the volume and mix of orders at the end of the quarter prevented EMC from fulfilling all of the customer demand for its Symmetrix systems.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We received more customer orders than we anticipated very late in June for our new EMC Symmetrix DMX-3 systems, and fewer than anticipated customer orders for our prior-generation Symmetrix DMX-2 systems, and we therefore did not have the right inventory mix to fulfill demand as we closed the quarter. The transition to our new storage platform families is now substantially complete and as we finished the quarter, it was clear that our customers have now completely embraced the new Symmetrix DMX-3 and CLARiiON CX-3 storage platforms. We ended the quarter with healthy margins on our bookings and a backlog that was approximately $100 million larger than planned. If we had been able to fulfill the strong Symmetrix DMX-3 demand and some of the other customer orders had come in a bit earlier, we certainly would have been able to meet our financial targets."
Tucci continued, "EMC's newer software businesses showed exceptionally strong results. License revenue from EMC's subsidiary, VMware, grew year-over-year by more than 70%. EMC's content management license revenue increased year-over-year by approximately 30%, excluding the impact of the Captiva acquisition. License revenues from EMC Smarts-related software offerings within our resource management business nearly doubled in the quarter, and our back-up and recovery software licenses bounced back nicely with year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 10%. Overall, the second quarter, while not up to our expectations, will show double-digit year-over-year revenue growth on the top line and gross margin improvement over the first quarter."
Bill Teuber, EMC Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, said, "During the second quarter we spent about $1 billion on our stock buyback program, repurchasing more than 78 million EMC shares. Through the first half of the year the company has repurchased a total of 106 million shares and spent about $1.5 billion including the redemption of convertible debt. We are going to continue to aggressively repurchase our shares in the second half of the year."
EMC plans to announce complete second quarter results this Friday morning, July 14, 2006, and the company has rescheduled its second quarter earnings conference call for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time that day. Supporting presentation slides and a live streaming of the conference call audio will be made available at .

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 14, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported full financial results for the second quarter of 2006. The company's 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth was highlighted by increased demand for VMware virtual infrastructure software and EMC Documentum content management software.
Total consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2006 was $2.57 billion, 10% higher than the $2.34 billion reported for the second quarter of 2005.
Net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $279 million or $0.12 per diluted share on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, which includes a charge of $0.02 per share for stock option expense, an additional $0.02 expense related to amortization of intangible assets and other equity compensation, and a $0.01 tax benefit, net of an in-process research and development charge. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter grew 15% to $0.15 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP second quarter 2005 earnings per diluted share of $0.13, which excludes $0.01 per share for amortization of intangible assets and equity compensation expense. Additional information about EMC's net income is included within the supplemental tables released with today's second-quarter financial announcement.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "While our execution was not up to our own high standards, our business and customer demand for our products and solutions remain strong. The compelling evidence is the 14% year-over-year growth in new bookings, which speaks to the broad customer endorsement of EMC's information lifecycle management strategy and the great value customers see in our unique technology. We know what we need to do to sharpen our execution going forward and will focus our efforts on both EMC's short-term performance and our company's long-term growth and opportunity."
"EMC has the most comprehensive information infrastructure portfolio in the industry, spanning platforms, software, services and solutions," Tucci continued. "In many of these areas, we delivered strong performances in the second quarter. For example, VMware had a record quarter, our content management software business again delivered very strong double-digit growth, and license revenues from EMC Smarts software nearly doubled. Our strategy continues to be validated by the performance of our newer software businesses, which are driven by the technology and people that have joined EMC through acquisition."
Systems revenue in the second quarter was $1.15 billion, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. Software license and maintenance revenue grew 14% to $997 million. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $424 million.
EMC completed the second quarter with $6.3 billion in cash and investments. Year-to-date the company has spent approximately $1.5 billion to purchase EMC shares in the open market and to redeem $125 million in convertible debt.
Bill Teuber, EMC Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to leverage our strong balance sheet during the quarter, deploying cash to deliver value to our shareholders. We accelerated our buyback program and are well on our way to meeting our commitment to spend at least $3 billion on EMC share repurchases by the end of this year. We also continued to add to our technology portfolio and customer base during the quarter, buying five small yet strategic software and services firms, and announcing an agreement to acquire RSA Security, the leader in protecting and managing identities and digital assets."
Second Quarter Highlights
EMC's newer software businesses continued to show strong financial performance during the second quarter. Excluding the impact of Captiva, content management software license revenues grew 30%, reflecting the growing synergy with EMC's traditional information storage business and customer appreciation for the EMC Documentum suite of content management products. During the quarter, EMC Documentum eRoom and Documentum Business Process Management software each received the coveted for exceptional quality and significant ROI potential for customers.

EMC backup and archive software license revenue returned to double-digit growth, increasing 13% over the prior-year second quarter. Organizations continue to turn to EMC software products, notably NetWorker, not only to back up and protect, but also to more quickly and reliably recover their data with minimal disruption to business operations.
EMC Smarts resource management software license revenue growth continued to accelerate during the second quarter as customers transition to model-based resource management to pinpoint service-affecting problems automatically and calculate the impact of those problems in real time without human intervention. Major advancements for EMC's resource management business in the quarter included the announcement of the breakthrough EMC Smarts Storage Insight for Availability software for automating root-cause and impact analysis of availability problems across the fibre channel storage area network, and the acquisition of nLayers, which brings EMC the necessary insight into application behavior and all interdependencies within the IT infrastructure.
VMware, an independent EMC subsidiary, grew total revenues 73% year-over-year to $157 million, its highest growth rate in five quarters. VMware's exceptional growth reflects customers' increasing adoption and standardization on VMware Infrastructure and the success of its growing virtual appliance/software life cycle and enterprise desktop businesses. VMware Infrastructure 3, which shipped in the last month of the quarter, added significant new hypervisor platform functionality as well as a suite of groundbreaking new virtualization-leveraging services including distributed resource management, high availability, and online agent-less backup. VMware launched the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Alliance during the quarter, with more than 20 hardware, software and service providers joining the initiative focused on hosted and mobile enterprise desktop solutions. VMware continued its focus on industry standards during the quarter, releasing the virtual machine disk format (VMDK) for free and without license.

This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (ix) war or acts of terrorism; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of EMC's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the text of this release or in the tables entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data" for the periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 attached to this release. EMC's non-GAAP measures may be defined differently
than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Specifically, stock option expense, restricted stock expense and intangible amortization is excluded from each non-GAAP financial measure in this release. Management views these items as non-cash expenses that are reported internally as corporate expenses. In addition, in some cases where specified, restructuring and other special charges and certain tax benefits are excluded from net income and earnings per share. For purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals, EMC's management uses financial statements that do not include such items.
EMC's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect the underlying economics of EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Such comparisons may be more meaningful because operating results presented under GAAP may include, from time to time, items that are not necessarily relevant to understand EMC's business and may, in some cases, be difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. One material limitation of a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization is that it does not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for this and other limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 12, 2006, EMC Corporation ("EMC" or the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of September 12, 2006 among EMC, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as Sole Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $2.2 billion facility, the proceeds of which are to be used to finance the acquisition by the Company of RSA Security Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RSA Security"). Interest on the borrowing under the Credit Agreement is LIBOR for a specified period plus a margin rate of 0.50% per annum and will be adjusted on a monthly basis.
The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. In addition, payment under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated following certain customary events of default including, but not limited to, (i) failure to make payments under the Credit Agreement when due, (ii) the voluntary filing of the Company for bankruptcy or (iii) the entry of any judgment in excess of $100 million against the Company, the enforcement of which remains unstayed. Notwithstanding acceleration pursuant to an event of default, the borrowing is scheduled to mature on March 15, 2007.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement.

The Company, each of its Material Subsidiaries and each of their ERISA Affiliates have complied in all material respects with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in material "default" (as defined in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan.

Exhibit 99.2
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.  September 18, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the leader in information management and storage, today announced it has completed the acquisition of Massachusetts-based RSA Security (NASDAQ:RSAS), the leader in protecting and managing online identities and digital assets. Under the terms of the definitive agreement announced on June 29, 2006, EMC paid $28.00 per share in cash in exchange for each outstanding share of RSA and the assumption of outstanding options for a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion, net of RSA's existing cash balance. RSA Security stockholders approved the acquisition on Thursday, September 14, 2006.
EMC also announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Massachusetts-based Network Intelligence, a privately-held leader in the security information and event management market, in a cash transaction valued at approximately $175 million. The acquisition of RSA and Network Intelligence joins market leaders which together will create the new information security division of EMC. The acquisition of Network Intelligence is expected to close by the end of business on September 18, 2006.
Joe Tucci, EMC's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Information security continues to dominate the spending intentions of CIO's around the world. The battlefront in security has quickly shifted from securing the network perimeter to protecting and securing the information itselfwherever that information lives and wherever it moves."
"The additions of RSA and Network Intelligence to the EMC family enable us to execute on our information-centric security strategy to help organizations around the world secure their information throughout its lifecycle and reduce the associated cost of regulatory compliance."
EMC's information-centric security strategy comprises five integrated elements that enable organizations to systematically and comprehensively secure their information. Those elements help customers assess the risk to their information, secure the people who access that
information, secure the infrastructure through which that access takes place, directly protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information itself, and manage security information and events to assure effectiveness and ease the burden of compliance.
RSA Security adds industry-leading enterprise identity and access management products, consumer identity and fraud protection solutions, encryption and key management software and tremendous security knowledge and expertise to EMC's expanding, information-centric security product and service portfolio. Network Intelligence advances EMC's information-centric security strategy by providing tools that enable companies to collect, monitor, analyze and report on security event-related activity throughout the IT infrastructure  in the network, in enterprise applications, on mainframes, on desktops, in storage devices or elsewhere. Solutions from Network Intelligence ease the burden of proving compliance with security policy and regulations, which is an enormous cost- and time-management issue today.
Operating under the RSA brand, EMC's security division will be headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts and led by Art Coviello, the former CEO of RSA Security. Coviello is an Executive Vice President of EMC and the President of RSA, reporting directly to Tucci. "It's becoming critical that security move beyond a point product solution. Customers are in need of security that is built in and broadly distributed within the IT infrastructure to protect people, gear and data as a cohesive solution," said Coviello. "EMC now has the resources and expertise to give customers seamless and pervasive security that allows them to leverage their information as a valuable asset rather than a potential liability."
EMC also announced the establishment of a $2.2 billion short-term, unsecured credit facility which it is using to pay for the RSA acquisition. David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The availability of this credit facility benefits EMC because it enables us to complete the acquisition while avoiding the cost of monetizing our short term investments ahead of normal maturity, providing a very efficient way for us to utilize the strength of our balance sheet."
Additionally, EMC reaffirmed its commitment to spend at least $3 billion repurchasing EMC shares during 2006. "When you consider the opportunity ahead of us, EMC stock at these levels continues to be one of the best values in the market, and we will continue to fund our buy back program," added Goulden.
Immediately following the announcement of EMC's intent to acquire RSA Security, the two companies assembled cross-functional teams to develop extensive integration plans designed to maximize business leverage and efficiencies. Key areas of integration include:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.  October 17, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2006. The company's 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth was highlighted by strong demand for new EMC Symmetrix DMX-3 and EMC CLARiiON CX3 networked storage systems and VMware Infrastructure.
Total consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2006 was a record $2.82 billion, 19% higher than the $2.37 billion reported for the third quarter of 2005. The September 2006 acquisitions of RSA Security and Network Intelligence, which form the foundation of EMC's new security division, contributed $37.8 million to EMC's third quarter 2006 revenue. Excluding revenue related to these acquisitions, revenue for the quarter was $2.78 billion, also a record for EMC and 17% higher than the third quarter of 2005.
Net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $283.7 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the September acquisitions, diluted earnings per share were also $0.13. Reported third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share were $0.17, which included a $0.04 tax-related benefit and excluded $0.03 related to stock option expense. Adjusting for these third-quarter 2005 items, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 were up 30% compared with the year-ago third quarter.
EMC also announced plans to implement consolidation efforts designed to deliver a more unified experience to customers through the further integration of EMC and most of the 21 acquisitions made over the past three years and by improving efficiencies across the company's business. The actions are expected to result in the departure of approximately 1,250 employees worldwide by the end of 2007. As a result, EMC estimates that it will record a pre-tax charge of between $150 million and $175 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006 to cover the cost of these consolidation efforts. VMware will continue to operate as an independent subsidiary of EMC and is not part of these actions.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC had a very solid quarter. We delivered the highest quarterly revenues in our 27-year history, even before including revenues from the newly acquired RSA Security and Network Intelligence businesses. We also achieved higher-than-expected earnings per share. We continue to grow significantly faster than the markets we serve, and we are clearly gaining a larger share of our growing worldwide market opportunity.
"Information storage, VMware and our EMC Smarts resource management software were among the standouts during the quarter," continued Tucci. "Our storage business benefited from strong customer response to the new Symmetrix DMX-3 and CLARiiON CX-3 systems introduced in the first half of the year. Outstanding execution from VMware delivered accelerated revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter as the new VMware Infrastructure 3 began to be deployed in data centers around the world. License revenue from our EMC Smarts products more than doubled as customers took advantage of our model-based approach to resource management, deploying it not only within their networks, but also across application and storage environments.
"At EMC our focus is on information," Tucci continued. "Over the past three years we have invested nearly $10 billion to bring innovative technologies to our customers through our own R&D and acquisitions. Today we have the world's best solutions for storing information, protecting and securing information, managing and moving information, and optimizing information infrastructures. Our greatest opportunity and competitive advantages lie in the value realized by our customers when these capabilities come together in a unified information infrastructure."
Commenting further on the planned consolidation efforts, Tucci said, "These actions, while difficult, are necessary. Customers are asking us to approach them more as a single, integrated partner, and to streamline some of our processes in order to bring innovation to them even faster, more simply and more cost-effectively than we do today. The time is right for us to accelerate the integration of EMC and most of the companies we have acquired over the past three years, create more efficient, centralized corporate functions, reduce management layers, and take greater advantage of opportunities to improve our overall cost structure."
Quarterly Results
Systems revenue in the third quarter was $1.3 billion, a 19% increase over the year-ago quarter. Software license and maintenance revenue grew 25% to $1.1 billion, and professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $432 million.
EMC completed the third quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and investments. During the third quarter, EMC borrowed $2.2 billion on a short-term, unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA Security. Year-to-date the company has spent approximately $2.6 billion to purchase 208 million EMC shares in the open market and to redeem $125 million in convertible debt.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "With overall revenues up 14% year-to-date, EMC is one of the fastest-growing large-cap technology companies in the world. We accelerated our stock buyback during the quarter, buying nearly a third more shares than we purchased during the second quarter and placing us on target to invest at least $3 billion repurchasing EMC shares during 2006."
Quarterly Highlights
EMC information storage revenues increased 14% compared with the year-ago quarter. EMC Symmetrix sales grew 21%, as customers continue to consolidate information and capitalize on the
performance, scalability and flexibility of these market-leading, high-end platforms. In the mid-tier, EMC CLARiiON revenues grew 18% over the year-ago quarter, driven by widespread customer and partner adoption of the easy-to-use and flexible new CLARiiON CX3 UltraScale systems. EMC Smarts model-based resource management software license revenues grew more than 100% during the quarter, highlighting the importance customers place on quickly gaining actionable management intelligence to minimize the impact of failures or congestion across the information infrastructure. EMC NetWorker software had double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth as organizations continued to invest in backup-to-disk and recovery management.
The EMC Content Management software business grew 25% compared with the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, EMC reached a significant milestone with the announcement of its 15,000th content management customer, reflecting EMC's strong share gains and leadership in this rapidly growing market.
Security revenues for the full quarter, including the period in which EMC did not own RSA Security or Network Intelligence, grew 30% compared with the year-ago period, with both companies having record revenue during the quarter. New customer acquisitions grew to over 1,500 during the quarter, reflecting, in part, the ongoing success of the recently-introduced RSA SecurWorld Channel Program and increasing traction with consumer-facing applications in financial services. Additional third quarter factors included positive momentum from Network Intelligence, as well as customer enthusiasm for RSA Security's acquisition by EMC.
VMware, an independent EMC subsidiary, had another record quarter and grew total revenues 86% year-over-year to $188.5 million. VMware delivered its highest year-over-year growth rate in five quarters and the second consecutive quarter of sequential quarterly growth of 20%. VMware's exceptional performance, which now places the company's revenue on an annualized run rate of $750 million, was fueled by broad adoption of VMware Infrastructure 3, which began shipping in June. VMware's third quarter momentum and expanding customer base were driven in part by the release of the free VMware Server, which includes the option to purchase enterprise-class support, and the announcement of a new product for Apple Mac users.

A reconciliation of the remaining non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the text of this release or in the tables entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data" for the periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 attached to this release. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
As specified certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release are adjusted for the results of operations of the security division, stock option expense, tax related benefit and restructuring charges. In addition, stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization and in-process research and development and the related tax impact of each is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the schedules entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data". Finally, where specified in the table entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data" for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax benefits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the schedule.
EMC's management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above listed expenses from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the security division, stock-based compensation, intangible amortization, in-process research and development, restructuring charges, the related tax impact of each and certain tax benefits, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof.
INTRODUCTION
Our financial objective is to achieve profitable growth. Management believes that by providing a combination of systems, software, services and solutions to meet customers' needs, we will be able to further increase revenues. Our efforts over the past few years have been primarily focused on growing revenues by enhancing and expanding our portfolio of offerings to satisfy our customers' requirements. We have also focused on improving operating margins by increasing gross margins and reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased from 6.4% for 2003 to 15.3% for 2005. Our gross margins have increased from 45.6% for 2003 to 53.7% for 2005. We have increased our overall investment in R&D from $718.5 in 2003 to $1,004.8 in 2005. These R&D expenditures have enabled us to introduce new and enhanced product and service offerings. We have also made acquisitions over the past three years to expand our offerings. We plan to continue to focus our efforts in 2006 on growing revenues and improving our gross and operating margins.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table presents certain consolidated income statement information stated as a percentage of total revenues.
 
Revenues
The following table presents revenue by our segments:
 
The EMC information storage products segment revenues include information storage systems and platform-based software revenues. Information storage systems revenues were $4,486.9, $3,871.0 and $3,314.7 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of 16% in 2005 and 17% in 2004. The increases in 2005 and 2004 were due to greater demand for these products attributable to wider acceptance of information lifecycle management-based solutions, a broadened product portfolio, increased demand for IT infrastructure and new and enhanced distribution channels. Platform-based software revenues were $1,215.2, $1,108.9 and $891.7 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of 10% in 2005 and 24% in 2004. Platform-based software revenues consist of revenues from software whose operation generally controls and enables functions that take place within an EMC storage system. The increases in 2005 and 2004 in platform-based software revenues were attributable to an expanded product offering, a greater demand for software to manage increasingly complex high-end and midrange networked storage environments and new and enhanced distribution channels. The reduced growth rate for platform-based software revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to the change in mix of information storage systems sold in 2005 to a higher proportion of systems that utilize a lower software content.
The EMC multi-platform software segment revenues include software license, software maintenance and other services revenues. Software licenses revenues were $1,019.4, $896.9 and $517.2 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of 14% in 2005 and 73% in 2004. Software maintenance and other services revenues were $675.5, $540.4 and $151.2 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of 25% in 2005 and 257% in 2004. Software license revenue increased due to greater demand for resource management software, backup and archive software and content management software. The results for each period were favorably impacted by the Legato and Documentum acquisitions which were completed in October and December 2003, respectively, and the Smarts acquisition which was completed in February 2005. The growth in software maintenance and other services revenues was primarily due to increased software maintenance revenues, which was favorably impacted by the aforementioned acquisitions.
The EMC services segment revenues include software and hardware maintenance and professional services revenues. EMC services revenues increased in 2005 and 2004 due to greater demand for both software and hardware maintenance contracts associated with increased sales of information storage products. Additionally, increased demand for professional services, largely to support and implement information lifecycle management-based solutions, contributed to the increases in 2005 and 2004.
The VMware segment was established as a result of the acquisition of VMware in January 2004 and is comprised of virtual infrastructure solutions and services. VMware's total revenues were $387.5 in 2005 and $218.2 in 2004. Software license revenues were $287.5 in 2005 and $178.3 in 2004, a 61% increase. The revenue increase was attributable to increased demand for virtual infrastructure software and the introduction of new product offerings. Software maintenance and services revenues were $100.0 in 2005 and $39.9 in 2004, a 151% increase. The increase in maintenance revenues was primarily due to increased software license sales.
The other businesses segment revenues consist of revenues from AViiON maintenance services. These revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years, as we have discontinued selling AViiON servers.
Revenues by geography were as follows:
 
Revenue increased in 2005 and 2004 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services. Also contributing to the increases were revenues generated from the acquisitions of Documentum and Legato in 2003, VMware in 2004, and Smarts in 2005, new and enhanced distribution channels and broadened product offerings. Changes in exchange rates positively impacted revenue growth by 0.8% in 2005 and by 3.7% in both 2004 and 2003. The impact of the change in rates was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, France and Italy.
 
We expect our revenues for 2006 to be between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion, representing a growth rate of between 15% and 17%. However, our revenues could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy, demand for IT infrastructure, product availability, competitive factors, changes in exchange rates and other factors set forth in Item 1A (Risk Factors).
Costs and expenses
The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income. As described in Note Q to our consolidated financial statements, these amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to give effect to a change in our segment operating performance measure.
 
Gross Margins
Our overall gross margin percentages were 53.7% in 2005, 51.2% in 2004 and 45.6% in 2003.
Gross margin percentages for the EMC information storage products segment were 44.2%, 42.9% and 38.8% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in the gross margin percentages were attributable to achieving higher sales volumes while at the same time improving our manufacturing cost structure. Provisions for product warranties, which reduce information storage products gross margins, were $127.4 in 2005, $146.5 in 2004 and $90.4 in 2003. The provision for warranties as a percentage of information storage systems revenues was 2.8% in 2005, 3.8% in 2004 and 2.7% in 2003. The increase in the
 
amount of the provision, as well as the increase in the provision as a percentage of information storage systems revenues in 2004 compared to 2003, was attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold and an increase in the service requirements to fulfill our warranty obligations. In 2005, as a result of cost control efforts, we were able to reduce the cost of fulfilling our service obligations. These efforts reduced the provision as a percentage of information storage systems revenues in 2005 compared to 2004.
The gross margin percentages for the EMC multi-platform software segment were 80.9%, 79.4% and 82.9% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in gross margin percentage from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to a more efficient cost structure for software maintenance and professional service offerings. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to a shift in the mix of software license revenues and services revenues, with a greater proportion of revenues being derived from services. Services revenues accounted for 38% of total segment revenues in 2004 compared to 23% in 2003. Services revenues provide a lower margin than software license revenues.
The gross margin percentages for the EMC services segment were 55.1%, 51.1% and 49.4% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The annual increases in the gross margin percentages were primarily attributable to improvements in the gross margin percentages earned from professional services. The margin improvements resulted primarily from reducing our services cost structure and a change in mix of our services offerings to services which provide a higher gross margin.
The gross margin percentage for the VMware segment was 88.3% in 2005 and 91.7% for 2004. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was attributable to a shift in the mix of software license revenues and services revenues, with a greater proportion of revenues being derived from services. Services revenues accounted for 26% of total VMware revenues in 2005 compared to 18% in 2004. Services revenues provide a lower margin than license revenues. This decrease was partially offset by gross margin improvement attributable to achieving higher sales volumes while controlling our operating cost structure.
The gross margin percentages for other businesses were 52.8%, 53.4% and 53.7% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentages resulted from declining revenues in this segment as the volume of AViiON maintenance contracts decreased.
The corporate reconciling items include stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense. These amounts were $77.7, $80.6 and $20.8 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense was $72.5, $75.7 and $20.3 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the Documentum, Legato and VMware acquisitions, which occurred between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004.
Research and Development
As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 10.4%, 10.3% and 11.5% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, we spent $167.1, $166.3 and $113.4 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on software development costs which were capitalized. R&D spending includes research and development on new product offerings and enhancements to our software and information storage systems. The increase in R&D expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the incremental R&D efforts resulting from the acquisitions of Legato and Documentum in 2003, VMware in 2004 and Smarts in 2005.
Selling, General and Administrative
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 27.0%, 27.5% and 26.6% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars spent each year was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Legato and Documentum in 2003, VMware in 2004, and Smarts in 2005. SG&A decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 as we achieved higher sales volumes while controlling our cost structure. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the acquisitions of LEGATO, Documentum and VMware. These operations have a higher selling cost as a percentage of revenue than EMC has historically incurred.
Restructuring and Other Special Charges
In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $101.6, $56.1 and $66.3, respectively.
The 2005 charge consisted of $17.4 of in-process R&D ("IPR&D") charges associated with acquisitions and $84.1 for employee termination benefits associated with work force rebalancing and reductions in force efforts and $0.4 of costs associated with vacating excess facilities. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $0.3 associated with prior years' restructuring programs.
 
The 2004 charge consisted of $17.4 of IPR&D charges associated with acquisitions and $38.7 of restructuring charges. The 2004 restructuring programs consisted of $24.5 of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force and $2.1 associated with vacating excess facilities. The remaining $12.1 of charges was associated with prior restructuring programs, primarily relating to additional rent expense for vacated facilities. The additional rent expense was attributable to a revised estimate of the time needed to sublet facilities.
The 2003 charge consisted of $29.1 of IPR&D charges associated with acquisitions, $18.6 of employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in force, $2.8 associated with vacating excess facilities, $10.5 pertaining to an asset impairment and $5.3 associated with prior restructuring programs.
The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections.
2005 Restructuring Programs
The activity for the 2005 restructuring programs for the year ended December 31, 2005 is presented below:
 
The 2005 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2005 that covered approximately 60 employees and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005 that covered approximately 1,000 employees. These actions impacted our major business functions and major geographic regions. Approximately 67% of the affected employees are or were based in North America, excluding Mexico, and 33% are or were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 80 employees have been terminated. Management plans to re-allocate the headcount from the fourth quarter charge to other areas of the business to enhance research and development activities and sales. The restructuring programs impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software, EMC services and other businesses segments.
The 2005 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2006, with the remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2007. The expected cash impact of the 2005 restructuring charges is $84.6, of which $4.8 was paid in 2005.
2004 Restructuring Programs
The activity for the 2004 restructuring programs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:
 
 
 
The 2004 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2004 and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregating approximately 400 employees across our major business functions and all major geographic regions. As of December 31, 2005, substantially all of the employees have been terminated. The remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction are expected to be paid by the end of 2006. The expected cash impact of the 2004 restructuring charge was $25.1, of which $8.6 was paid in 2004 and $10.7 was paid in 2005.
The $2.4 reversal to the provision for workforce reduction in 2004 was attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for reduction.
The 2004 restructuring programs impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software and EMC services segments.
2003 Restructuring Program
The activity for the 2003 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below:
 
 
 
The $4.8 reversal of the provision for workforce reduction in 2004 was attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for reduction. The $7.9 addition to the provision for elimination of excess facilities in 2004 related to additional charges for facilities being vacated as the time to sublet the facilities was greater than originally estimated.
In 2003, as a result of the LEGATO acquisition, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.5 for a duplicative EMC software project. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of its estimated discounted cash flows. The impaired asset is classified within our EMC multi-platform software segment.
The 2003 workforce reduction impacted approximately 200 employees across our major business functions and all our major geographic regions. The 2003 restructuring program impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software and EMC services segments.
The expected cash impact of the 2003 restructuring program is $22.3 of which $3.9 was paid in 2003, $13.3 was paid in 2004, and $4.6 was paid in 2005. The remainder is expected to be paid in 2006.
 
Prior Year Restructuring Programs
In 2002, we instituted a restructuring program. The activity for the 2002 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below:
 
 
 
The $24.1 addition to the provision for workforce reduction in 2003 was primarily attributable to finalizing severance packages for employees in foreign jurisdictions. The $6.1 addition to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2003 represents the charges for facilities being vacated, offset by the reversal of reserves related to the reactivation of facilities that had previously been vacated.
In addition to these restructuring programs, we have remaining liabilities aggregating $53.3 associated with restructuring programs prior to 2002. The remaining balance relates primarily to consolidation of facilities. All restructuring programs, with the exception of the 2005 restructuring programs, are substantially complete, although our ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The total remaining liability for all of our restructuring programs was $154.6 as of December 31, 2005. The remaining balance relates primarily to consolidation of facilities and employee termination benefits. These amounts are expected to be paid out through 2015.
As of December 31, 2005, we had a goodwill balance of $3,883.5. At least annually we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of December 31, 2005, none of the reporting units had any indication that goodwill was likely to be impaired.
As we continue to refine our business model, we will reassess our cost structure and asset deployment to assess whether additional changes are necessary. Should we determine that additional changes will benefit our business, we may incur additional restructuring and other special charges. If customer demand for products change or we acquire complementary products, we may be required to write down the value of assets. Additionally, changes in our business model or market conditions could cause goodwill or other assets to be impaired.
 
Investment Income
Investment income was $190.4, $156.7 and $187.8 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments and sales-type leases. Investment income increased in 2005 due to higher outstanding cash and investment balances and greater yields on investments and was partially offset by increased realized losses on investments. Investment income decreased in 2004 from 2003 due to lower yields on outstanding investment balances and reduced realized gains from the sale of investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 3.4%, 2.6% and 2.7% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Realized (losses) gains were $(58.9), $(11.7) and $30.5 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net were $10.6, $8.2 and $14.9 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to increased foreign currency losses. The decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to gains from selling strategic investments, partially offset by increased foreign currency losses.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate was 31.4%, 26.5% and 13.1% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. For 2005, 2004 and 2003 the effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate as a result of the mix of income attributable to foreign versus domestic jurisdictions. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. Additionally, in 2005, we recognized an income tax benefit of $163.9 from the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. These favorable reductions in our effective tax rate were partially offset by several factors. In 2005, we repatriated approximately $3,000.0 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The repatriation resulted in an incremental income tax expense of $180.2. Also in 2005, we incurred $17.4 of non-deductible IPR&D charges from acquisitions. We did not derive a tax benefit from these charges. For 2004, as a result of tax audits, we recognized a $20.0 reduction in our estimated income tax exposure pertaining to certain of our international tax liabilities. Partially offsetting these benefits were non-deductible IPR&D charges of $17.4 incurred in connection with acquisitions. For 2003, we favorably resolved a series of tax matters which aggregated $80.9. The tax matters included the resolution of certain merger-related contingencies. Partially offsetting these benefits were non-deductible IPR&D charges of $29.1 incurred in connection with acquisitions.
Financial Condition
Cash provided by operating activities was $2,216.3 in 2005, $2,102.3 in 2004 and $1,521.2 in 2003. Cash received from customers was $9,732.8, $8,329.4 and $6,693.8 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The annual increases were attributable to higher sales volume and greater cash proceeds from the sale of maintenance contracts. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $7,539.9, $6,299.1 and $5,507.7 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The annual increases were partially attributable to higher headcount. Total headcount was approximately 26,500, 22,700 and 20,000 at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum in 2003, VMware in 2004, Smarts, Rainfinity and Captiva in 2005 and general growth of the business accounted for the headcount increases as well as for the higher sales volume. Greater levels of component purchases to meet customer demand for information storage systems also contributed to the increased amounts of payments to suppliers. At the end of 2005 we were in the midst of transitioning our high end information storage systems to the next product generation. This resulted in an increase in our inventory levels which grew from $514.1 as of December 31, 2004 to $724.8 as of December 31, 2005. Cash received from dividends and interest was $249.2, $162.4 and $185.9 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The improvement in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher rates of return received on our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. The 2004 decline was due to lower rates of return received on our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. In 2005 and 2004, we paid $216.7 and $84.0, respectively, in income taxes. In 2003, we received $152.3 in net tax refunds. The payments in 2005 and 2004 represent our net payouts of international, federal and state income tax liabilities.
Cash used for investing activities was $611.7, $2,064.7 and $1,059.4 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, we spent an aggregate of $683.7 to acquire Smarts, Rainfinity, Captiva and several other companies. In 2004, we acquired VMware for $539.4, net of cash acquired. Capital additions were $601.1, $371.4 and $368.5 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in capital spending in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to additional facility requirements resulting from the acquisitions and various IT initiatives to enable us to more effectively service our growing customer base. Depreciation and
 
amortization expense was $640.0, $616.4 and $520.7 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in each year was primarily attributable to intangible amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of Documentum and LEGATO in 2003, VMware in 2004, and Smarts and Rainfinity in 2005. Additionally, increases in amortization of capitalized software development costs contributed to the increase. Capitalized software development costs were $167.1, $166.3 and $113.4 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the amount capitalized in 2005 and 2004 was attributable to the aforementioned acquisitions. Lastly, a general growth in our property, plant and equipment balances in both 2004 and 2005 resulted in greater depreciation expense. Net (sales) and purchases and maturities of investments were $(868.4), $858.1 and $839.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This activity varies from year to year based upon our cash collections and cash requirements.
Cash used for financing activities was $743.6, $323.8 and $40.1 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our principal financing activity has been the repurchase of our common stock in the open market. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of 300.0 million shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2005, we have repurchased 182.5 million shares, spending $1,003.4, $545.7 and $127.0 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We anticipate we will purchase additional shares of our common stock during 2006, however, the number of shares purchased and timing of our purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the price of our stock, market conditions, our cash position and alternative demands for our cash resources. We generated $263.3, $230.0 and $112.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, from the exercise of stock options.
In December 2003, we assumed, through our acquisition of Documentum, $125.0 in senior convertible notes that mature on April 1, 2007 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Holders of the Notes are entitled to convert the Notes at any time before the close of business on April 1, 2007, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the Notes, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $13.80 per share. The Notes may be redeemed by us at a price of 101.8% of the face value through April 1, 2006 and at a price of 100.9% of the face value from April 2, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The Notes will effectively rank behind all secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing those debts. The Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants. We have called all of the outstanding Notes for redemption on April 3, 2006.
Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $7,355.5, $7,440.8 and $6,907.6 at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We invest our excess cash in U.S. government and agency obligations, U.S. corporate debt securities, asset and mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, auction rate securities and foreign debt securities. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our short and long-term investments was $5,033.1 compared to an amortized cost basis of $5,066.4. Included in our portfolio are securities where the amortized cost basis exceeded the fair value by $40.0. Management regularly reviews the portfolio to evaluate whether any impairments are other-than-temporary. Management considers the type of securities held, market conditions, the length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity to make its evaluation. As of December 31, 2005, management did not consider any impairments to be other-than-temporary.
We have a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. At December 31, 2005, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the bank's base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants.
We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure.
Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months.
To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
Contractual Obligations
We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005:
 
Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space is more cost-effective than purchasing real estate. The long-term convertible debt pertains to debt assumed in our acquisition of Documentum. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non-manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage-based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service.
Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations
EMC's subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $62.3 as of December 31, 2005. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions.
We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and/or copyright. Most of these agreements in which we license our trademarks to another party require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers.
We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives.
We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies.
We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer.
In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company's by-laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired company's directors' and officers' insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. In connection with certain dispositions, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties. These indemnities vary in length of time.
 
Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2005, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2005 are not material.
Notes and Accounts Receivable
We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes.
Litigation
We are a party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Pension and Post-Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans
We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans were frozen in 1999, resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans' assets is based upon the assets' fair value. The expected long-term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 8.25%. This rate represents the average of the long-term rates of return for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by the plans' assets as of December 31, 2005. The actual long-term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2005 was 7.3%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long-term rate of return for 2006 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on the plans' assets would have approximately a $0.9 impact on the 2006 pension expense. As of December 31, 2005, the pension plans had a $141.9 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.7%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long-term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2005. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.7 impact on the 2006 pension expense for all plans (international and U.S.).
We also assumed a post-retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plan's assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plan's assets is equal to the assets' fair value. The expected long-term rate of return on the plan's assets for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 8.25%. The actual long-term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2005 was 7.3%. Based on current capital market conditions, the expected long-term rate of return for 2005 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on the plan's assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2005, the plan had a $1.8 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be recognized over the anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.7%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long-term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition"; Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"; Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition"; FAS No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists"; FAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases"; and SOP No. 81-1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts," among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate.
Warranty Cost
s
We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates.
Asset Valuation
Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level. The analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates. The estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset.
Restructuring Charges
We recognized restructuring charges in 2005, 2004, 2003 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted.
Accounting for Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted.
 
Accounting for Stock Options
Historically, we recognized stock option costs pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," in the notes to our financial statements. Effective in 2006, we will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." Both FAS No. 123 and 123R require management to make assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the stock options. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Additionally, we will be required to incorporate a forfeiture estimate as we recognize equity expense. Should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, this could have a material impact on our financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." Effective on January 1, 2006, we will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 123R that require us to recognize the fair value of options granted in our basic financial statements.
This statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements. Previously, we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements. See "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in Note A to the financial statements.
The statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified, repurchased, or canceled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date. The compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under Statement No. 123. Changes to the grant-date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded. The compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under Statement No. 123, which was the straight-line method, except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued. Any unearned or deferred compensation (contra-equity accounts) related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts. Additionally, common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option.
The statement also changes the reporting of tax-related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The gross amount of windfall tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation will be reported as financing inflows. Under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows, any shortfalls resulting from the write-off of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change in deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
We plan to adopt the statement on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006. Accordingly, the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations. The adoption of FAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations, increasing cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. We currently estimate that adoption of the statement will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09 in 2006; however, the amount may change based upon the number and value of additional stock option grants and forfeiture rates. We have utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options. We estimated volatility to be 40.3%, 46.4% and 55.0% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in volatility in 2005 and 2004 was due to our recent volatility experience. We estimated the expected life of stock options that were issued to be 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0 years in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in the expected life in 2005 and 2004 was due to a change in current exercise patterns. For more information on the impact of expensing stock options on the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, see "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in Note A to the financial statements.
 
ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Brazil real, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and South East Asia.
We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes.
We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value-at-risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by BearMeasurisk as of December 31, 2005. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one-day holding period. The value-at-risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.7 million as of December 31, 2005 and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The average, high and low value-at-risk amounts for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions):
 
The average value represents an average of the quarter-end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts.
Interest Rate Risk
We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage-backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk.
We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value-at-risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2005. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one-day holding period. The value-at-risk on the investment portfolios was $2.1 million as of December 31, 2005 and $6.5 million as of December 31, 2004. The average, high and low value-at-risk amounts for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions):
 
 
The average value represents an average of the quarter-end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, short and long-term investments, accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. We purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade. The bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating-rate coupons, which significantly reduces interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2005, bank loans represent 7% of our cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. We believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government-backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties.
We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value-at-risk for changes in credit conditions for our bank loan portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among credit spreads, market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2005. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one-day holding period. The value-at-risk on the bank-loan portfolios was $0.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2004. The average, high and low value-at-risk amount for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions):
 
The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $39.9 million and $41.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes.
 

Exhibit 99.2
ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
 
The management of EMC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
 
 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
EMC's management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, EMC's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in .
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
Based on our assessment, EMC's management determined that, as of December 31, 2005, EMC's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
EMC's management's assessment of the effectiveness of EMC's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Form 8-K.
 
To the Stockholders and the
Board of Directors of EMC Corporation:
We have completed integrated audits of EMC Corporation's 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EMC Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 (not presented herein) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in this Current Report on Form 8-K, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Accounting Principles
The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EMC and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Basis of Presentation
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation.
Use of Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We derive revenue from sales of information systems, software and services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. This policy is applicable to all sales, including sales to resellers and end users. The following summarizes the major terms of our contractual relationships with our customers and the manner in which we account for sales transactions.
 
Systems sales consist of the sale of hardware, including Symmetrix systems, CLARiiON systems, NetWin and Celerra systems, Centera systems and Connectrix systems. Revenue for hardware is generally recognized upon shipment.
 
Software sales consist of the sale of software application programs. Our software products provide customers with resource management, backup and archiving, content management and server virtualization capabilities. Revenue for software is generally recognized upon shipment or electronic delivery. License revenue from royalty payments is recognized upon either receipt of royalty reports or payments from third parties.
 
 
Services revenue consists of installation services, professional services, software maintenance, hardware maintenance and training.
Installation and professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities, do not require specialized skills and may be performed by our customers or other vendors. Installation services revenues are recognized upon completion of installation. Professional services revenues include information infrastructure assessments and design, integration and implementation, business continuity, data migration, residencies, networking storage and project management. Engagements for which reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are capable of being made are recognized as earned based upon the hours incurred. Revenue on all other engagements is recognized upon completion.
Software and hardware maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period.
Training revenues are recognized upon completion of the training.
 
When more than one element such as hardware, software and services are contained in a single arrangement, we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element's relative fair value, provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting. An item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. Fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately. Fair value of software support services may also be measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements. In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled.
 
Our sales contracts generally provide for the customer to accept title and risk of loss when the product leaves our facilities. When shipping terms or local laws do not allow for passage of title and risk of loss at shipping point, we defer recognizing revenue until title and risk of loss transfer to the customer.
 
Revenue from sales-type leases is recognized at the net present value of future lease payments. Revenue from operating leases is recognized over the lease period.
 
We accrue for the estimated costs of systems' warranty at the time of sale. We reduce revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of sale. Systems' warranty costs are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of systems' requirements. Sales returns are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of probable returns.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs are classified in cost of product sales.
 
 
Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency is the functional currency of the majority of our subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense, net, and consist of losses of $17.9 million in 2005, $13.4 million in 2004, and $13.3 million in 2003.
Derivatives
We use derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures related to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and forecasted revenue and expense transactions.
We hedge our exposure in foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Since these derivatives hedge existing exposures that are denominated in foreign currencies, the contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, all outstanding derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded in other expense, net, in the income statement. These derivative contracts mature in less than one year.
We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure on a portion of our forecasted revenue and expense transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. All outstanding derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying forecasted transactions occur. To achieve hedge accounting, the criteria specified in FAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instrument and Hedging Activities" must be met. These criteria include (i) ensuring at the inception of the hedge that formal documentation exists for both the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and (ii) at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributed to the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. Further, an assessment of effectiveness is required whenever financial statements or earnings are reported. Absent meeting these criteria, changes in fair value are recognized currently in other expense, net in the income statement. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement, in the related revenue or expense caption, as appropriate. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to the other expense, net, in the income statement in the then-current period. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings, which did not represent a material amount for the fiscal years presented. The ineffective portion of the derivatives consists of option premiums, discounts or premiums on forward contracts and gains or losses associated with differences between actual and forecasted amounts. Our cash flow hedges generally mature within six months or less. There were $107 million of cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2005, $60 million of cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and no cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2003.
We do not engage in currency speculation. For purposes of presentation within the statement of cash flows, derivative gains and losses are presented within net cash provided by operating activities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market securities, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. agency discount notes and commercial paper. Cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market. Total cash equivalents were $1,659.4 million and $734.9 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollectible accounts and notes receivable. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the
 
 
receivable and current market and economic conditions. Uncollectible amounts are charged against the allowance account. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained against both our current and non-current accounts and notes receivable balances. The balances in the allowance accounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (table in thousands):
 
Investments
Our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market value. Investments with remaining maturities of less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities of more than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.
We also hold strategic equity investments. Strategic equity investments in publicly traded companies are classified as available for sale when there are no restrictions on our ability to liquidate such securities. These investments are also carried at their market value. Strategic equity investments in privately-held companies are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value due to their illiquid nature. We review these investments to ascertain whether unrealized losses are other than temporary.
Unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments classified as available for sale are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of any related tax effect. Realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairments on non-strategic investments are reflected in the income statement in investment income. Realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairments on strategic investments are reflected in the income statement in other expense, net. Investment activity is accounted for primarily using the first-in, first-out method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, not in excess of net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Buildings under development are included in building construction in progress. Depreciation commences upon placing the asset in service and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
 
Upon retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed with any gain or loss recognized in the income statement. Repair and maintenance costs, including planned maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D costs include salaries and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility through the general release of the software products are capitalized. Technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a detailed program design or working model. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from eighteen months to two years which represent the products' estimated useful lives. The expense associated with the straight-line method exceeds the amount of expense computed using the ratio of current period gross product revenues to total anticipated
 
 
gross product revenues. Unamortized software development costs were $261.6 million and $219.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included in other assets, net. Amortization expense was $124.5 million, $113.5 million and $90.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amounts capitalized were $167.1 million, $166.3 million and $113.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Long-lived Assets
Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from one to twelve years. Intangible assets include goodwill, purchased technology, trademarks and tradenames, customer relationships and customer lists, software licenses, patents and contracts. Goodwill is carried at its historical cost.
We periodically review our long-lived assets and certain other intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. We initiate reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
We test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Advertising
Advertising production costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $14.7 million, $11.7 million and $14.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Legal Costs
Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are recognized when the costs are probable of occurrence and estimable.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax credits are generally recognized as reductions of income tax provisions in the year in which the credits arise. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax.
Earnings Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of stock options, unvested restricted stock and convertible debt.
Retirement/Post Employment Benefits
Pension cost for our domestic defined benefit pension plan is funded to the extent that current pension cost is deductible for U.S. Federal tax purposes and to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade Bureau additional minimum funding requirements. Net pension cost for our international defined benefit pension plans are generally funded as accrued.
 
 
Post-retirement benefit cost for the domestic post-retirement benefits plan assumed as part of our acquisition of Data General Corporation is generally funded on a pay-as-you-go basis to the extent that current cost is deductible for U.S. Federal tax purposes.
Concentrations of Risks
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. We purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade. The bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating-rate coupons, which significantly reduces interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2005, bank loans represented 7% of our cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. We believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government-backed securities or letters of credit and is held in our possession. At December 31, 2005, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. We provide credit to customers in the normal course of business. Credit is extended to new customers based upon industry reputation or a check of credit references. Credit is extended to existing customers based on prior payment history and demonstrated financial stability. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is limited due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. Our sales are generally dispersed to a large number of customers, minimizing the reliance on any particular customer or group of customers. Dell, Inc., one of our channel partners, accounted for 12% of our revenues in 2005. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties.
We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose customer orders. We attempt to minimize this risk by finding alternative suppliers or maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet our forecasted needs.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" defined a fair value method of accounting for stock options and other equity instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. As provided for in FAS No. 123, we elected to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period for time-based restricted stock grants and stock options granted where the exercise price is below the market price on the date of the grant. For performance-based restricted stock grants that have a graded vesting schedule, compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The following is a reconciliation of net income per weighted average share had we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 for the periods presented (table in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
The 2004 and 2003 amounts have been adjusted from the amounts reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2004 to be calculated following the same method that will be utilized under FAS No. 123R. The total impact of the charge was to increase the incremental stock option expense per FAS No. 123 net of taxes by $8.3 million in 2004 and $7.7 million in 2003.
The fair value of each option granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." Effective on January 1, 2006, we will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 123R that require us to recognize the fair value of options granted in our basic financial statements.
This statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements. Previously, we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements.
The statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified, repurchased, or canceled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date. The compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under Statement No. 123. Changes to the grant-date fair value of equity awards
 
 
granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded. The compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under Statement No. 123, which was the straight-line method, except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued. Any unearned or deferred compensation (contra-equity accounts) related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts. Additionally, common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option. The statement also changes the reporting of tax related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The gross amount of windfall tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation will be reported as financing inflows. Under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows, any shortfalls resulting from the write-off of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change in deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
We plan to adopt the statement on a modified prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006. Accordingly, the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations. The adoption of FAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations, increasing cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. We currently estimate that adoption of the statement will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09 in 2006; however, the amount may change based upon the number and value of additional stock option grants and forfeiture rates.
Under the EMC Corporation 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan"), certain awards granted to an employee who meets the age and/or length of service requirements for "retirement" set forth in the plan generally will continue to vest after such employee's retirement without additional service, subject to the terms and conditions of the grant document. In connection with the above reconciliation of net income assuming adoption of FAS No. 123, our policy with respect to these awards has been to recognize compensation cost over the stipulated vesting period, which is typically five years. If the employee retires before the end of the vesting period, any remaining unrecognized compensation cost would be recognized at the date of retirement. The SEC has determined that companies that follow this approach should continue to do so for all applicable equity-based awards issued prior to the effective date of FAS No. 123R. These awards should also continue to be accounted for in this manner subsequent to the effective date of FAS No. 123R. The cost of applicable equity-based awards issued subsequent to the effective date of FAS No. 123R, however, should be recognized through the retirement eligibility date. Had we recognized compensation expense over this shorter service period, the increase in stock compensation costs, net of taxes, presented on a proforma basis under FAS No. 123 would have been $57.0 million, $29.1 million and $15.5 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
B. Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Acquisition of Captiva
In December 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Captiva. Captiva is a provider of software solutions that capture and manage business-critical information from paper, faxed and scanned forms and documents, Internet forms and XML data streams, converting them into information that is usable in database, document, content and other information management systems. The acquisition enables us to deliver an expanded solution to our customers, enabling them to gain a richer understanding of their information and become better equipped to classify it, create policy based workflow and automate information lifecycle management.
The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was $322.5 million, which consisted of $280.9 million of cash, $36.2 million in fair value of our stock options and $5.4 million of transaction costs, which primarily consisted of financial advisory, legal and accounting services. The fair value of our stock options issued to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the stock options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
The intrinsic value allocated to the unvested options issued in the acquisition that had yet to be earned as of the acquisition date was $8.0 million and has been recorded as deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation. The
 
 
purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and a final determination of required purchase accounting adjustments will be made upon the receipt of an independent appraisal and the finalization of our integration activities.
The following represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price (table in thousands):
 
In determining the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, our intention to use the acquired assets and historical demand and estimates of future demand of Captiva's products and services. The fair value of intangible assets was primarily based upon the income approach. The rate used to discount the net cash flows to their present values was based upon a weighted average cost of capital of 15%. The discount rate was determined after consideration of market rates of return on debt and equity capital, the weighted average return on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted sales related to the technology and assets acquired from Captiva.
The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets is 5.3 years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill is classified within the EMC multi-platform software segment.
Of the $82.4 million of acquired intangible assets, $14.3 million was allocated to IPR&D and was written off at the date of acquisition because the IPR&D had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility. The write-off is included in restructuring and other special charges in our income statement. Two IPR&D projects were identified relating to data capture and input. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined utilizing the income approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the projects. The stage of completion of each in-process project was estimated to determine the discount rate to be applied to the valuation of the in-process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with in-process technology, we deemed a discount rate of 30% as appropriate for valuing IPR&D.
In connection with the Captiva acquisition, we commenced integration activities which have resulted in recognizing $2.3 million in liabilities for employee termination benefits which will be paid through 2006. No payments had been made as of December 31, 2005. Management is in the process of determining whether additional liabilities relating to employee termination benefits or other contractual obligations are required to be recorded.
Acquisition of Rainfinity, Inc.
In August 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Rainfinity for approximately $90.0 million in cash. Rainfinity is a provider of virtualization solutions for heterogeneous NAS and file systems environments. The acquisition enables us to provide more comprehensive information lifecycle management solutions to our customers, helping them to improve their capacity utilization and performance and simplify data migration and consolidation projects regardless of the NAS operating systems they may be using. Pro forma results and other financial disclosures have not been provided because the effects of the acquisition were not material to us.
 
 
Acquisition of Smarts, Inc.
In February 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Smarts. Smarts' software products automatically locate root-cause problems, calculate their impact across technology domains and present the logical action plan required to keep business services up and running. The acquisition enables us to offer event automation and real-time network systems management software. Additionally, the acquisition enables us to apply the modeling, correlation and root cause analysis technology to expand our information and storage management offerings.
The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was $293.5 million, which consisted of $252.6 million of cash, $37.4 million in fair value of our stock options and $3.5 million of transaction costs, which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. The fair value of our stock options issued to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the stock options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
The intrinsic value allocated to the unvested options issued in the acquisition that had yet to be earned as of the acquisition date was $3.5 million and has been recorded as deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation. The consolidated financial statements include the results of Smarts from the date of acquisition. The purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
The following represents the allocation of the purchase price (table in thousands):
 
In determining the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, our intention to use the acquired assets and historical demand and estimates of future demand of Smarts' products and services. The fair value of intangible assets was primarily based upon the income approach. The rate used to discount the net cash flows to their present values was based upon a weighted average cost of capital of 16%. The discount rate was determined after consideration of market rates of return on debt and equity capital, the weighted average return on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted sales related to the technology and assets acquired from Smarts.
The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets is 6.0 years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill is classified within the EMC multi-platform software segment.
Of the $47.4 million of acquired intangible assets, $3.1 million was allocated to IPR&D and was written off at the date of acquisition because the IPR&D had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility. The write-off is included in restructuring and other special charges in our income statement. Three IPR&D projects were identified relating to real-time management of networks and services. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined utilizing the income
 
 
approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the projects. The stage of completion of each in-process project was estimated to determine the discount rate to be applied to the valuation of the in-process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with in-process technology, we deemed a discount rate of 40% as appropriate for valuing IPR&D.
In connection with the Smarts acquisition, we commenced integration activities which resulted in recognizing an aggregate of $6.4 million in liabilities for lease obligations, employee termination benefits and other contractual obligations, of which $2.7 million was paid through December 31, 2005. The amounts will be paid over the remaining periods through 2008.
Acquisition of VMware, Inc.
In January 2004, we acquired all of the shares of outstanding stock of VMware, a software company specializing in virtualization technology. VMware's technology enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously and independently on the same Intel-based server or workstation and move live applications across systems without business disruption. We determined that the acquisition advances our goal of simplifying the information technology operations of our customers. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was approximately $613.1 million, which consisted of $539.4 million of cash, $72.0 million in fair value of our stock options and $1.7 million of transaction costs, which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. The fair value of our stock options issued to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the stock options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
The intrinsic value allocated to the unvested options issued in the acquisition that had yet to be earned as of the acquisition date was $47.3 million and has been recorded as deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of VMware from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for 2004 have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition were not material to us. The purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values as of the acquisition date (table in thousands):
 
In determining the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, our intention to use the acquired assets, historical demand and estimates of future demand of VMware's products and services. The fair value of intangible assets was primarily based upon the income approach. The rate used to discount the net cash flows to their present values
 
 
was based upon a weighted average cost of capital of 14%. The discount rate was determined after consideration of market rates of return on debt and equity capital, the weighted average return on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving forecast sales related to the technology and assets acquired from VMware.
The total weighted-average amortization period for the intangible assets is 4.8 years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill is classified within our VMware segment.
Of the $126.0 million of acquired intangible assets, $15.2 million was allocated to IPR&D and was written off at the date of acquisition because the IPR&D had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility. The write-off is included in restructuring and other special charges in our income statement. Three IPR&D projects were identified relating to virtual machine software. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined utilizing the income approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the projects. The stage of completion of each in-process project was estimated to determine the discount rate to be applied to the valuation of the in-process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with in-process technology, we deemed a discount rate of 50% as appropriate for valuing IPR&D.
Pro forma Effect of the Acquisitions
The following pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition of Smarts and Captiva as if the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2004. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been in effect for the period presented (table in thousands, except per share data):
 
Acquisition of LEGATO Systems, Inc.
In October 2003, we acquired all of the shares of outstanding common stock of LEGATO. LEGATO developed, marketed and supported software products and services for information protection and recovery, hierarchal storage management, automated availability, e-mail and content management. We determined that the acquisition would expand our portfolio of open storage software, provide software-focused sales expertise, extensive channel partner relationships and strong service capabilities. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $1.4 billion, which consisted of $1.2 billion of our common stock, $141.5 million in fair value of our stock options and $15.4 million of transaction costs, which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. We issued approximately 106 million shares of our common stock, the fair value of which was based upon a five-day average of the closing price two days before and two days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and publicly announced.
The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $1.1 billion, other intangible assets of $176.8 million and an IPR&D charge of $19.6 million.
In connection with the LEGATO acquisition, we commenced integration activities which have resulted in involuntary terminations and lease and contract terminations. The following summarizes the obligations recognized in connection with the LEGATO acquisition and activity to date (table in thousands):
 
 
 
 
We expect to pay the remaining balance for involuntary termination benefits through 2007. The liability for lease and other contractual termination benefits will be paid over the remaining contract periods through 2011.
Acquisition of Documentum, Inc.
In December 2003, we acquired all of the shares of outstanding common stock of Documentum. Documentum provided enterprise content management software, enabling organizations to organize and manage unstructured data. We determined that the acquisition would provide us the opportunity to expand our product offerings, enabling customers to implement a total information storage solution for managing unstructured content. Additionally, the acquisition expanded our software-focused sales expertise and provided strong service capabilities. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $1.8 billion, which consisted of $1.6 billion of common stock, $207.6 million in fair value of our stock options and $20.5 million of transaction costs, which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. We issued approximately 115 million shares of our common stock, the fair value of which was based upon a five-day average of the closing price two days before and two days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and publicly announced.
The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $1.4 billion, other intangible assets of $234.6 million and an IPR&D charge of $9.5 million.
In connection with the Documentum acquisition, we commenced integration activities which have resulted in involuntary terminations and lease terminations. The following summarizes the obligations recognized in connection with the Documentum acquisition and activity to date (tables in thousands):
 
 
 
 
We expect to pay the remaining balance for involuntary termination benefits through 2007. The liability for leases will be paid over the remaining lease terms through 2008.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, excluding goodwill as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, consist of (tables in thousands):
 
 
Amortization expense on intangibles was $112.8 million, $109.3 million and $37.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, amortization expense on intangible assets for the next five years was as follows (table in thousands):
 
 
 
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, net, on a consolidated basis and by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 consist of the following (tables in thousands).
 
 
We test the goodwill balances for impairment at least annually. There was no impairment in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
C. Restructuring and Other Special Charges
In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $101.6 million, $56.1 million and $66.3 million, respectively.
The 2005 charge consisted of $17.4 million of IPR&D charges associated with acquisitions and $84.1 million for employee termination benefits associated with work force rebalancing and reductions in force efforts and $0.4 million of costs associated with vacating excess facilities. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $0.3 million associated with prior years' restructuring programs.
The 2004 charge consisted of $17.4 million of IPR&D charges associated with acquisitions and $38.7 million of restructuring charges. The 2004 restructuring programs consisted of $24.5 million of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force and $2.1 million associated with vacating excess facilities. The remaining $12.1 million of charges was associated with prior restructuring programs, primarily relating to additional rent expense for vacated facilities. The additional rent expense was attributable to a revised estimate of the time needed to sublet facilities.
 
 
The 2003 charge consisted of $29.1 million of IPR&D charges associated with acquisitions, $18.6 million of employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in force, $2.8 million associated with vacating excess facilities, $10.5 million pertaining to an asset impairment and a net adjustment of $5.3 million associated with prior restructuring programs.
The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections.
2005 Restructuring Programs
The activity for the 2005 restructuring programs for the year ended December 31, 2005 is presented below (table in thousands):
 
The 2005 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2005 that covered approximately 60 employees and a second which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005 that covered approximately 1,000 employees. These actions impacted our major business functions and all major geographic regions. Approximately 67% of the affected employees are or were based in North America, excluding Mexico, and 33% are or were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 80 employees have been terminated. Management plans to re-allocate the headcount from the fourth quarter charge to other areas of the business to enhance R&D activities and sales. The restructuring programs impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software, EMC services and other businesses segments.
The 2005 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2006, with the remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2007. The expected cash impact of the 2005 restructuring charges is $84.6 million, of which $4.8 million was paid in 2005.
2004 Restructuring Programs
The activity for the 2004 restructuring programs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is presented below (tables in thousands):
 
 
The 2004 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2004 and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregating approximately 400 employees across our major business functions and all major geographic regions. As of December 31, 2005, substantially all of the employees have been
 
 
terminated. The remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction are expected to be paid by the end of 2006. The expected cash impact of the 2004 restructuring charge was $25.1 million, of which $8.6 million was paid in 2004 and $10.7 million was paid in 2005.
The $2.4 million reversal to the provision for workforce reduction in 2004 was attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for reduction.
The 2004 restructuring programs impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software and EMC services segments.
2003 Restructuring Program
The activity for the 2003 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below (tables in thousands):
 
 
 
The $4.8 million reversal of the provision for workforce reduction in 2004 was attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for reduction. The $7.9 million addition to the provision for elimination of excess facilities in 2004 related to additional charges for facilities being vacated as the time to sublet the facilities was greater than originally estimated.
In 2003, as a result of the LEGATO acquisition, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.5 million for a duplicative EMC software project. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of its estimated discounted cash flows. The impaired asset is classified within our EMC multi-platform software segment.
The 2003 workforce reduction impacted approximately 200 employees across our major business functions and all our major geographic regions. The 2003 restructuring program impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC multi-platform software and EMC services segments.
 
 
The expected cash impact of the 2003 restructuring program is $22.3 million of which $3.9 million was paid in 2003, $13.3 million was paid in 2004, and $4.6 million was paid in 2005. The remainder is expected to be paid in 2006.
Prior Year Restructuring Programs
2002 Restructuring Program
In 2002, we instituted a restructuring program. The activity for the 2002 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below (tables in thousands):
 
 
 
The $24.1 million addition to the provision for workforce reduction in 2003 was primarily attributable to finalizing severance packages for employees in foreign jurisdictions. The $6.1 million addition to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2003 represents the charges for facilities being vacated, offset by the reversal of reserves related to the reactivation of facilities that had previously been vacated. The remaining balance owed for the consolidation of excess facilities represents lease obligations on vacated facilities. These amounts are expected to be paid out through 2011.
2001 Restructuring Program
In 2001, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure. The activity for the 2001 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below (tables in thousands):
 
 
 
 
The restructuring program impacted the EMC information storage products, EMC services and other businesses segments.
The adjustments to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2005 and 2004 were attributable to incremental rental costs due to the inability to sublet certain facilities. The adjustment to the consolidation of excess facilities in 2003 related to the reactivation of a previously vacated facility. The remaining balance owed for the consolidation of excess facilities represents lease obligations on vacated facilities. These amounts are expected to be paid out through 2012.
Other Restructuring Programs
During 1999, we recorded a charge of $223.6 million relating to restructuring, merger and other special charges primarily associated with our acquisition of Data General. In 1998, we recorded a charge of $135.0 million related to a Data General restructuring program. The amounts charged against the established provisions for the 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs for each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below (table in thousands):
 
 
 
During 2004 and 2003, the Data General restructuring accrual was reduced by $4.5 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The reductions in 2004 and 2003 pertaining to the workforce reduction liability resulted from our favorable resolution of previously recognized contractual obligations associated with employee terminations. The reduction in 2003 for the consolidation of excess facilities resulted from management's decision to utilize a facility that we had previously vacated.
The balances in the 1998 and 1999 restructuring programs as of December 31, 2005 relate to executive severance and a remaining lease obligation that will be paid through 2015.
D. Convertible Debt
In April 2002, Documentum sold $125.0 million in senior convertible Notes that mature on April 1, 2007, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Documentum in December 2003. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Holders of the Notes are entitled to convert the Notes at any time before the close of business on April 1, 2007, subject to our prior redemption or repurchase of the Notes, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $13.80 per share. The Notes may be redeemed by us at a price of 101.8% of the face value through April 1, 2006 and at a price of 100.9% of the face value from April 2, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The Notes will effectively rank behind all secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing those debts. The Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Notes have been recorded at their fair market value as of the date of the acquisition of Documentum with a portion allocated to the conversion component. The fair market value of the debt component as of the acquisition date of $130.0 million is being adjusted to the debt's face value of $125.0 million using the effective interest method through April 1, 2007. The fair market value of the conversion component of $26.3 million has been allocated to additional paid-in capital. We have called all of the outstanding Notes for redemption on April 3, 2006.
E. Derivatives
At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our foreign currency hedges resulted in both an unrealized gain of $13.1 million classified in other current assets and an unrealized loss of $12.1 million classified in accrued expenses. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our foreign currency hedges resulted in both an unrealized gain of $18.3 million classified in other current assets and an unrealized loss of $13.0 million classified in accrued expenses.
The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives held by us for 2005, 2004 and 2003 (table in thousands):
 
As of December 31, 2005 the unrealized gains on derivative instruments consisted of gross unrealized gains of $1.8 million and gross unrealized losses of $0.8 million. The unrealized gain is expected to be reclassified into the income statement in 2006.
F. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair Value
The carrying amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, current portion of long-term debt and accounts and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of our long-term convertible debt at December 31, 2005 was $133.6 million, compared to a carrying amount of $127.0 million. The fair value is based upon the trading price of the debt.
 
 
Investments
The following tables summarize the composition of our available for sale, short and long-term investments, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (tables in thousands). Fair value was determined based upon quoted market prices for the security.
 
 
Gross unrealized gains on these investments were $6.7 million and $9.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross unrealized losses on these investments were $40.0 million and $38.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross realized gains on these investments were $4.9 million, $18.4 million and $48.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross realized losses on these investments were $63.8 million, $30.1 million and $17.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The effective maturities of investments held at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows (tables in thousands):
 
 
 
 
Unrealized losses on investments at December 31, 2005 by investment category and length of time the investment has been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows (table in thousands):
 
We evaluate investments with unrealized losses to determine if the losses are other than temporary. The gross unrealized losses related to bank loans were due to changes in credit spreads. All other gross unrealized losses were due to changes in interest rates. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2005 are temporary. In making this determination, we considered the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, the magnitude of the losses compared to the investments' cost, the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position and our ability to hold the investment to maturity.
The following table summarizes our strategic investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (table in thousands). The investments are classified within other assets, net in the balance sheet. Fair value for publicly-traded investments is determined based upon quoted prices. Fair value is not available for privately-held investments.
 
Gross unrealized gains on these investments were $0.6 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross unrealized losses on these investments were $0.7 million and $0 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross realized gains on strategic investments were $7.0 million, $5.2 million and $1.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross realized losses on strategic investments were $1.4 million, $0.5 million and $0, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
G. Inventories
Inventories consist of (table in thousands):
 
 
 
H. Notes Receivable
Notes receivable are primarily from sales-type leases of our products. The payment schedule for such notes at December 31, 2005 is as follows (table in thousands):
 
Actual cash collections may differ from amounts shown on the table due to early customer buyouts, trade-ins or refinancings. We typically sell without recourse our notes receivable and underlying equipment associated with our sales-type leases to third parties.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollected notes receivable. This allowance is part of our allowance for bad debts (See Note A).
I. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment consists of (table in thousands):
 
Building construction in progress and land owned at December 31, 2005 include $93.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, of facilities not yet placed in service that we are holding for future use. Depreciation expense was $402.7 million, $393.6 million and $391.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
J. Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses consist of (table in thousands):
 
 
 
Product Warranties
Systems sales include a standard product warranty. At the time of the sale, we accrue for systems' warranty costs. The initial systems' warranty accrual is based upon our historical experience and specific identification of systems' requirements. Upon expiration of the initial warranty, we may sell additional maintenance contracts to our customers. Revenue from these additional maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period. The following represents the activity in our warranty accrual for our standard product warranty (table in thousands):
 
The current year accrual includes amounts accrued for systems at the time of shipment, adjustments within the year for changes in estimated costs for warranties on systems shipped in the year and changes in estimated costs for warranties on systems shipped in prior years. It is not practicable to determine the amounts applicable to each of the components.
K. Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes consists of (table in thousands):
 
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA") created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In October 2005, our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan to repatriate approximately $3.0 billion in foreign earnings; such repatriation resulted in a current tax provision of $180.2 million. Additionally, we recognized a $163.9 million benefit in 2005 resulting from the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations, the majority of which is attributable to foreign operations.
In 2004, we were able to utilize $252.7 million of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce the current portion of our tax provision.
 
 
The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. A reconciliation of our income tax provision to the statutory federal tax rate is as follows:
 
The components of the current and noncurrent deferred tax assets are as follows (table in thousands):
 
We have federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $126.7 million and $107.9 million, respectively. Portions of these carryforwards are subject to annual limitations, including Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for U.S. tax purposes and similar provisions under other countries' tax laws. Certain net operating losses will begin to expire in 2006, while others have an unlimited carryforward period.
The valuation allowance increased from $62.0 million at December 31, 2004 to $63.8 million at December 31, 2005. The net increase was principally attributable to an increase in capital loss carryforwards and a decrease in credit carryforwards of domestic subsidiaries and net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 relates to foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards and domestic tax credit carryforwards.
 
 
Deferred income taxes have not been provided on basis differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries. These basis differences were approximately $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and consisted of undistributed earnings permanently invested in these entities. The change in the basis difference between 2004 and 2005 was attributable to the approximate $3.0 billion in foreign earnings repatriated under the AJCA, partially offset by $781.4 million of income earned in the current year. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings is approximately $280.0 million and $780.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income before income taxes from foreign operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $781.4 million, $632.0 million and $343.9 million, respectively.
L. Retirement Plans and Retiree Medical Benefits
401(k) Plan
We have established a deferred compensation program for certain employees that is qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code. EMC will match pre-tax employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation during each pay period (subject to the $750 maximum match each quarter). Matching contributions are immediately 100% vested. Our contribution amounted to $36.8 million in 2005, $30.5 million in 2004 and $26.0 million in 2003.
Employees may elect to invest their contributions in a variety of funds, including an EMC stock fund. The deferred compensation program limits an employee's maximum investment allocation in the EMC stock fund to 30% of their total contribution. Our matching contribution mirrors the investment allocation of the employee's contribution.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the U.S. In addition, certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans were frozen in 1999, resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services.
Benefits under these plans are generally based on either career average or final average salaries and creditable years of service as defined in the plans. The annual cost for these plans is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method that includes actuarial assumptions and estimates which are subject to change. Prior service cost is amortized over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The measurement date for the plans is December 31.
Our investment policy provides that no security, except issues of the U.S. Government, shall comprise more than 5% of total plan assets, measured at market. At December 31, 2005, the Data General U.S. pension plan held $0.4 million of our common stock.
The Data General U.S. pension plan and certain foreign retirement plans (the "Pension Plans") are summarized in the following tables.
The components of the change in benefit obligation of the Pension Plans are as follows (table in thousands):
 
 
 
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of the assets of the Pension Plans is as follows (table in thousands):
 
In 2005, we contributed an additional $15.0 million to the U.S. pension plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to the Pension Plans in 2006.
The financial position of the Pension Plans is as follows (table in thousands):
 
Amounts recognized in the balance sheet consist of the following (table in thousands):
 
The components of net periodic benefit cost of the Pension Plans are as follows (table in thousands):
 
The weighted-average assumptions used in the Pension Plans to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:
 
 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used in the Pension Plans to determine periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
 
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets. The weighted average asset allocations are as follows:
 
The target allocation of the assets in the Pension Plans at December 31, 2005 consisted of equity securities of 70% and debt securities of 30%.
Our Pension Plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. Our investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to maximize returns while preserving principal.
The benefit payments are expected to be paid in the following years (table in thousands):
 
Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plan
Our post retirement benefit plan, which was assumed in connection with the acquisition of Data General, provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. With the exception of certain participants who retired prior to 1986, the medical benefit plan requires monthly contributions by retired participants in an amount equal to insured equivalent costs less a fixed EMC contribution which is dependent on the participant's length of service and Medicare eligibility. Benefits are continued to dependents of eligible retiree participants for 39 weeks after the death of the retiree. The life insurance benefit plan is noncontributory. The measurement date for the plan is December 31.
 
 
The components of the change in benefit obligation are as follows (table in thousands):
 
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets is as follows (table in thousands):

The assumed health care cost trend rate for the plan is as follows:
 
The effects of a one percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows (table in thousands):
 
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets.
The actual asset allocations are as follows:
 
The target allocation of the assets in the plan as of December 31, 2005 was 70% equity securities and 30% debt securities.
The plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. Our investment strategy with respect to the plan is to maximize returns while preserving principal.
The benefit payments are expected to be paid in the following years (table in thousands):
 
 
 
M. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Lease Commitments
We lease office and warehouse facilities and equipment under various operating leases. Facility leases generally include renewal options. Rent expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows (table in thousands):
 
Our future lease commitments are as follows (table in thousands):
 
We have sublet certain of our office facilities. Non-cancelable sublease proceeds are as follows (table in thousands):
 
Outstanding Purchase Orders
At December 31, 2005 we had outstanding purchase orders aggregating approximately $1.1 billion. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non-manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage-based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service.
Line of Credit
We have available for use a credit line of $50.0 million in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the bank's base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants.
Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations
EMC's subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $61.9 million as of December 31, 2005. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions.
 
 
We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and/or copyright. Most of these agreements in which we license our trademarks to another party require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers.
We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives.
We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies.
We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC and our subsidiaries, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer.
In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company's by-laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired company's directors' and officers' insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. In connection with certain dispositions, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties. These indemnities vary in length of time.
Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2005, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2005 is immaterial.
Litigation
In May 2005, EMC and Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") jointly announced that the parties had agreed to amicably dismiss all claims and counterclaims with no findings or admissions of liability in a settlement of all pending patent infringement litigation between EMC and HP. As part of the settlement between the two companies, HP will pay a net $325 million balancing payment to EMC which can be satisfied through the purchase of complementary EMC products and services, such as the VMware product line, over the next five years as follows: HP will pre-pay $65 million to EMC prior to the beginning of each of five consecutive periods ("Purchase Periods"). The Purchase Periods begin on September 1, 2005, December 1, 2006, December 1, 2007, December 1, 2008 and December 1, 2009. The first pre-payment was made on August 29, 2005. The remaining payments will be made on November 29, 2006, November 29, 2007, November 29, 2008 and November 30, 2009. During each Purchase Period, HP may use its pre-payment as credit for product and services purchases from EMC for HP's resale or internal use. Unused credits will expire at the end of each Purchase Period. For purposes of computing the amount of credit applied per dollar of EMC products that HP purchases, hardware products shall be deemed to have been purchased for 50% of the actual purchase price.
If EMC purchases HP products or services during the Purchase Periods, HP will be required to make an equivalent amount of additional product or services purchases from EMC of up to an aggregate amount of $108 million over five years, with caps for each Purchase Period as follows: $10.8 million for the first Purchase Period, $21.7 million for each of the second, third and fourth Purchase Periods and $32.5 million for the final Purchase Period. If HP does not make the required amount of additional purchases of EMC products and services attributable to such Purchase Period, HP will be required to pay the difference to EMC in cash. For purposes of computing the amount of credit applied per dollar of HP products that EMC purchases, hardware products shall be deemed to have been purchased for 50% of the actual purchase price.
 
 
We are a party to various litigation matters which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
N. Stockholders' Equity
Common Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 300.0 million shares of our common stock. The purchased shares will be available for various corporate purposes, including our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. As of December 31, 2005, we had reacquired a total of 182.5 million shares at a cost of $2,058.3 million.
On July 1, 2004, the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA") became effective and eliminated treasury shares. Under the MBCA, shares repurchased by Massachusetts corporations constitute authorized but unissued shares. As a result, all of our former treasury shares were automatically converted to unissued shares on July 1, 2004 and have been accounted for as a reduction of common stock (at par value) and additional paid-in capital.
Net Income Per Share
The reconciliation from basic to diluted earnings per share for both the numerators and denominators is as follows (table in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
Options to acquire 91.7 million, 101.7 million and 92.0 million shares of common stock as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because of their antidilutive effect. The effect of our senior convertible debt (see Note D) assumed in connection with our acquisition of Documentum on the calculation of diluted net income per weighted average share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was calculated using the "if converted" method. The convertible debt was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2003 because of its antidilutive effect.
 
 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
Accumulated other comprehensive income, which is presented net of tax, consists of the following (table in thousands):
 
Reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and the income statement consist of the following (table in thousands):
 
Preferred Stock
Our series preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine, without further action by our shareholders.
Equity Plans
The EMC Corporation 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The exercise price for a stock option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Incentive stock options will expire no later than ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock is common stock that is subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Restricted stock units represent the right to receive shares of common stock in the future, with the right to future delivery of the shares subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units that vest only by the passage of time will not vest fully in less than three years after the date of grant. The 2003 Plan allows us to grant up to 200.0 million shares of common stock, no more than 60.0 million shares which may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
In addition to the 2003 Plan, we have three employee stock option plans (the "1985 Plan", the "1993 Plan", and the "2001 Plan"). Under the terms of each of the three plans, the exercise price of incentive stock options issued must be equal to at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. In the event that non-qualified stock options are granted under the 1985 Plan, the exercise price may be less than the fair market value at the time of grant, but in the case of employees not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, not less than par value which is $.01 per share, and in the case of employees subject to Section 16, not less than 50% of the fair market value on the date of grant. In the event that non-qualified stock options are granted under the 1993 Plan or the 2001 Plan, the exercise price may be less than the fair market value at the time of grant but not less than par value.
A total of 748.0 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the four above plans.
In 2005 and 2004, a respective aggregate of 20,190,764 and 4,660,000 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units were granted to certain employees, consultants and Directors under the 2003 Plan. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants were $14.06 in 2005 and $12.66 in 2004. These awards have various vesting terms including pro rata vesting over 3 years, cliff vesting at the end of 3 or 5 years from the date of grant with acceleration for achieving specified performance criteria and cliff vesting on various dates, contingent on achieving specified performance criteria.
 
 
The grants have been recorded as deferred compensation on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the vesting periods of the awards.
In 2003, options to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $.01 per share were granted to an employee. The options were exercisable on the date of grant and were exercised. The shares of common stock issued upon exercise are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and repurchase by EMC upon certain events which lapse on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Discounts from fair value have been recorded as deferred compensation and are being amortized over a five-year vesting period; however, in the event that certain performance-related criteria are met, the vesting accelerates. As of December 31, 2005, 50,000 shares have vested.
In 2002, performance-related options to purchase 2,063,000 shares of common stock were granted at $7.70 per share, the fair market value on the date of grant, to certain employees. The options vest ratably over five years; however, in the event that certain performance-related criteria are met, the vesting accelerates. As of December 31, 2005, 1,943,828 shares have vested.
We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to members of our Board of Directors (the "Directors Plan"). A total of 14.4 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan. The exercise price for each option granted under the Directors Plan will be at a price per share determined at the time the option is granted, but not less than 50% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant.
At December 31, 2005, there was an aggregate of approximately 89.5 million shares available for issuance pursuant to future option grants under the 1985 Plan, the 1993 Plan, the 2001 Plan, the 2003 Plan and the Directors Plan. Except as noted above, options generally become exercisable in annual installments over a period of three to five years after the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant.
We have, in connection with the acquisition of various companies, assumed the stock option plans of these companies. We do not intend to make future grants under any of such plans.
Activity under all stock option plans for the three years ended December 31, 2005 is as follows (shares in thousands):
 
 
 
Summarized information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005 is as follows (shares in thousands):
 
There were 155.4 million, 136.4 million and 111.3 million outstanding options that were exercisable at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under our 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1989 Plan"), eligible employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions, at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value at the time of exercise. In May 2004, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 1989 Plan to increase the number of shares available for grant to 98.0 million shares from 73.0 million shares. Options to purchase shares are granted twice yearly, on January 1 and July 1, and are exercisable on the succeeding June 30 or December 31. Grants for the last three years are as follows (shares in thousands):
 
O. Related Party Transactions
In 2003, we retained a company owned by an individual who is the brother and uncle of certain members of our Board of Directors as a broker to provide various forms of corporate insurance. We paid such company approximately $8,000 in 2003.
In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we leased certain real estate from a company owned by a member of our Board of Directors and such Director's siblings, for which payments aggregated approximately $3.8 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Such leases were initially assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of Data General in 1999, and one lease was renewed for a ten-year term in 2003.
We purchased upgrades and licenses to software products from two companies, for which payments aggregated approximately $3.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We sublet facilities to one of these companies, for which we were paid $30,000 in 2004. A member of our Board of Directors is Chairman of the Board of Directors of one of these companies and is managing partner and general partner in a limited partnership which is currently a stockholder of both such companies.
From time to time during 2005, EMC paid for the use by a number of EMC employees and Directors of an aircraft beneficially owned by a current employee and former executive officer and Director of EMC for EMC business trips. EMC payments for use of the aircraft aggregated approximately $590,000 in 2005.
 
 
In February 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of a privately-held company. A member of our Board of Directors is a general partner in a limited partnership that was a stockholder of such company. Proceeds to the limited partnership as a result of this acquisition were approximately $2.7 million.
EMC is a large global organization which engages in thousands of purchase, sales and other transactions annually. We enter into purchase and sales transactions with other publicly and privately held companies, universities, hospitals and not-for-profit organizations in which members of our Board of Directors or executive officers are executive officers or members of boards of these entities. We enter into these arrangements in the ordinary course of our business.
From time to time, we make strategic investments in privately-held companies that develop software, hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies. We may purchase from or make sales to these organizations.
We believe that the terms of each of these arrangements described above were fair and not less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties.
P. Risks and Uncertainties
Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; delays or reductions in information technology spending; risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; component and product quality and availability; the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; war or acts of terrorism; the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; fluctuating currency exchange rates; risks associated with litigation; and other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.3
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.  Nov. 13, 2006  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $3 billion of convertible senior notes.
EMC intends to offer $1.5 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2011 and $1.5 billion due in 2013. The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). In certain circumstances, the notes may be settled with cash up to the principal amount. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, EMC has the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of EMC common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock. The interest rate, conversion price and other terms are to be determined by negotiations between EMC and the initial purchasers of the notes. EMC also expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to $450 million of additional notes.
Concurrently with the transaction, EMC will purchase with a portion of the offering proceeds convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes, their affiliates or other financial institutions. These convertible note hedge transactions are intended to offset the dilution to EMC's common stock resulting from potential future conversion of the notes. EMC will also enter into separate transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers, their affiliates or other financial institutions to sell warrants to purchase shares of its common stock that will have an exercise price that is approximately 50 percent higher than the closing price of EMC's common stock on the date the warrants are issued. The counterparties to these hedging transactions, or their affiliates, will purchase shares of EMC common stock or enter into derivative transactions in EMC common stock concurrently with the pricing of the notes.
EMC will use the net proceeds from the transactions to repay in full the $2.2 billion that it borrowed under a senior credit facility to finance its acquisition of RSA Security Inc. It also expects to purchase approximately $850 million worth of shares of its common stock with proceeds from the transactions and cash on hand. EMC expects to repurchase all of these shares contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes, in privately negotiated transactions through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates.
Today's announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. Any offers of the securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes and the shares of EMC common stock issuable upon conversion have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  November 14, 2006EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information management and storage, today announced the pricing of $1.725 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2011 and $1.725 billion convertible senior notes due in 2013, for an aggregate transaction size of $3.45 billion, an increase of $450 million from the amount announced yesterday, November 13, 2006. The notes are being sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
The 2011 and 2013 notes will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 1.75 percent per annum. The 2011 and 2013 notes will be convertible, at the holder's option during specified periods, at an initial conversion rate of 62.1978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a 27.5 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share on November 13, 2006. In certain circumstances, the notes may be settled with cash up to the principal amount. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, EMC has the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of EMC common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock. The initial purchasers have no option to purchase additional notes.
EMC estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $3.4 billion after deducting estimated discounts, commissions and expenses.
EMC expects to use the proceeds from the transactions to repay in full the $2.2 billion that it borrowed under a senior credit facility to finance its acquisition of RSA Security Inc.
EMC also expects to use a portion of the offering proceeds to fund convertible note hedge transactions that EMC has entered into with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes, their affiliates or other financial institutions. These convertible note hedge transactions are intended to offset the dilution to EMC's common stock resulting from potential future conversion of the notes. EMC also entered into separate transactions with certain of the initial purchasers, their affiliates and other financial institutions to sell warrants to purchase shares of its common stock, which will have an exercise price of approximately $19.55 per share, representing a 55 percent premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share on November 13, 2006. The counterparties to these transactions, or their affiliates, have purchased shares of EMC common stock or entered into derivative transactions in EMC common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the notes.
 
Contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes, EMC is purchasing approximately $946 million worth of shares of its common stock with proceeds from the transactions and $34 million of its cash on hand, in privately negotiated transactions through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates. EMC expects to spend at least $3.6 billion in 2006 repurchasing EMC shares and redeeming $125 million in convertible debt related to its 2003 acquisition of Documentum.
Today's announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. Any offers of the securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes and the shares of EMC common stock may be issued upon conversion have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

On November 13, 2006, EMC Corporation (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which it agreed to sell $1.725 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and $1.725 billion aggregate principal amount of its 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes") to Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers").
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on November 17, 2006. The Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), issuable in certain circumstances upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied upon these exemptions from registration based in part up on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement. The Company estimates that the net proceeds to it from the offering of the Notes, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, will be approximately $3.4 billion.
The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of November 17, 2006, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the Indenture (including the form of the 2011 Note and the form of the 2013 Note) is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes in this report are summaries only, and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, respectively.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's existing senior unsecured debt and all of the Company's future senior unsecured debt. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries and to any secured debt of the Company.
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on December 1 and June 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2007. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes will mature on December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2013, respectively.
Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period (the "measurement period") in which the price per Note of the applicable series for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Common Stock and the
conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2006, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified events. The Notes will be convertible, regardless of the foregoing circumstances, at any time from, and including, September 1, 2011 to, and including, the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2011 Notes (in the case of the 2011 Notes) and at any time from, and including, September 1, 2013 to, and including, the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2013 Notes (in the case of the 2013 Notes).
Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes converted. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes converted, the Company has the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock based on a daily conversion value, determined in accordance with the Indenture, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20-day observation period. The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 62.1978 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents a 27.5 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 of the Common Stock on November 13, 2006 and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.08 per share of Common Stock. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. In addition, if a "fundamental change" (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, the Company will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental change.
Subject to certain exceptions, if the Company undergoes a "designated event" (as defined in the Indenture) including a "fundamental change," holders of the Notes will have the option to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date. The Company will pay cash for all Notes so repurchased. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of November 17, 2006, with the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering the resale of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes to become effective within 180 days after November 17, 2006. The Company also has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earliest of (i) the date when all securities covered by the registration statement have been sold; (ii) the expiration of the applicable holding period with respect to the Notes and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act, or any successor provision; and (iii) the date that is two years after the effective date of the registration statement. The Company may suspend the use of the registration statement to resell Notes or shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes for reasons relating to pending corporate developments, public filings or other events.
Subject to certain limitations, the Company will be required to pay the holders of the Notes special interest on the Notes if the Company fails to register the Notes and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes within, or to keep such registration statement effective during, specified time periods.
A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary only, and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "Purchased Options") with each of Dresdner Bank AG, Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (collectively, the "Dealers"). The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of the Common Stock. The Company paid an aggregate amount of approximately $669 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Options.
The Company also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby the Company sold to the Dealers warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of Common Stock (the "Sold Warrants") at a strike price of approximately $19.55 per share of Common Stock. Half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and March 15, 2012 and have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and March 18, 2014. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $391 million from the sale of the Sold Warrants.
The Purchased Options and Sold Warrants are separate contracts entered into by the Company with the Dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes.
The Purchased Options are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes if the Company net-share settles the Purchase Options in the event that the market value per share of Common Stock, as measured under the Purchased Options, at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the Purchased Options, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. If, however, the volume-weighted average price per share of the Common Stock exceeds the strike price of the Sold Warrants when the Sold Warrants are exercised, the Company will be required to issue shares of the Common Stock to the Dealers, and those issuances will have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share.
If the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of any exercise under the Purchased Options is above the strike price of the Purchased Options, and if the Company net-share settles the Purchased Options, the Purchased Options entitle the Company to receive from the Dealers net shares of the Common Stock based on the excess of the then current volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Purchased Options. Additionally, if the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock at the time of exercise under any Sold Warrants exceeds the
strike price of the Sold Warrants, the Company will owe the dealers net shares of Common Stock in an amount based on the excess of the then current volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Sold Warrants.
The Purchased Options and Solid Warrants will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $19.55 per share of Common Stock, representing an approximate 55 percent premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share of Common Stock on November 13, 2006.
The Sold Warrants and the underlying Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sold Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
On November 17, 2006, the Company completed its repurchase of approximately $946 million worth of its outstanding Common Stock in privately negotiated transactions.

The Holders on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such notice, declaration or direction shall have become effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies) having joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such notice, declaration or direction shall automatically and without any action by any Person be canceled and of no further effect.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the May 15 or November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Company, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities not less than 10 days prior to the Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any automated quotation system or securities exchange on which the Securities may be quoted or listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payments of principal shall be made upon the surrender of this Security at the option of the Holder at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such lawful monies of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, by United States Dollar check drawn on, or wire transfer to, a United States Dollar account (such a transfer to be made only to a Holder of an aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of U.S. $1,000,000 and only if such Holder shall have furnished wire instructions in writing to the Trustee no later than 15 days prior to the relevant payment date). Payment of interest on this Security may be

made on an Interest Payment Date by United States Dollar check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Security Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by transfer to a United States Dollar account (such a transfer to be made only to a Holder of an aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of U.S. $1,000,000 and only if such Holder shall have furnished wire instructions in writing to the Trustee no later than 15 days prior to the relevant payment date).
Except as specifically provided herein and in the Indenture, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof or an Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of their respective authorized signatories, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Security to be duly executed.
 
 
 
This security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011" (herein called the "2011 Notes" and, together with the Company's 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013, the "Securities") issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 17, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the 2011 Notes and of the terms upon which the 2011 Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the 2011 Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the 2011 Note or 2011 Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder will issue the new 2011 Notes in the requested denominations. Additional 2011 Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.
No sinking fund is provided for the 2011 Notes and the 2011 Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company.
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal of or interest or Special Interest on any 2011 Note or the last day on which a Holder of a 2011 Note has a right to convert his 2011 Note shall be, at any Place of Payment or Place of Conversion, as the case may be, a day on which banking institutions at such Place of Payment or Place of Conversion are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, then payment of principal, interest, or Special Interest, or delivery for conversion of such 2011 Note need not be made on or by such date at such place but may be made on or by the next succeeding day at such place which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption or repurchase, or by such last day for conversion, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period after such date.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities, and in other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities;
 
that no such supplemental indenture shall make any of the changes set forth in Section 8.2 of the Indenture, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Security affected thereby. It is also provided in the Indenture that, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the 2011 Notes, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except as provided in the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this 2011 Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future holders and owners of this 2011 Note and any 2011 Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this 2011 Note or such other 2011 Notes.
provided, however,
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this 2011 Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, this 2011 Note, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, upon the occurrence of a Designated Event, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such Holder's 2011 Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Designated Event Repurchase Date at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2011 Notes such Holder elects to require the Company to repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Designated Event Repurchase Date. The Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of record of the 2011 Notes a notice of the occurrence of a Designated Event and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof on or before the twentieth day after the occurrence of any Designated Event.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, on and after September 1, 2011, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture and prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity, to convert any 2011 Notes or portion thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or Reference Property, in each case at the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture, upon surrender of this 2011 Note, together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is contained under Section 2.4 of the Indenture, as provided in the Indenture and this Security, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at the option of such Holder, the Corporate Trust Office, and, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this 2011 Note, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney. The initial Conversion Rate shall be 62.1978 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of 2011 Notes. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon any conversion, but an adjustment in cash will be paid to the Holder, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any 2011 Note or 2011 Notes for conversion. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or any shares issued upon conversion of such 2011 Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
 
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this 2011 Note at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new 2011 Note or 2011 Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange thereof, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax, assessments or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee, any authenticating agent, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this 2011 Note (whether or not this 2011 Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, for the conversion hereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any other authenticating agent nor any Paying Agent nor any other Conversion Agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this 2011 Note.
No recourse for the payment of the principal of, or accrued and unpaid interest or Special Interest on, this 2011 Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any 2011 Note, or because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, officer, director or subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
Terms used in this 2011 Note and defined in the Indenture are used herein as therein defined.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TENANT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform gift to Minors Act).

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013" (herein called the "2013 Notes" and, together with the Company's 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011, the "Securities") issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 17, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the 2013 Notes and of the terms upon which the 2013 Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the 2013 Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of 2013 Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the 2013 Note or 2013 Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder will issue the new 2013 Notes in the requested denominations. Additional 2013 Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.
No sinking fund is provided for the 2013 Notes and the 2013 Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company.
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal of or interest or Special Interest on any 2013 Note or the last day on which a Holder of a 2013 Note has a right to convert his 2013 Note shall be, at any Place of Payment or Place of Conversion, as the case may be, a day on which banking institutions at such Place of Payment or Place of Conversion are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, then payment of principal, interest, or Special Interest, or delivery for conversion of such 2013 Note need not be made on or by such date at such place but may be made on or by the next succeeding day at such place which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption or repurchase, or by such last day for conversion, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period after such date.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities, and in other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities;
 
that no such supplemental indenture shall make any of the changes set forth in Section 8.2 of the Indenture, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Security affected thereby. It is also provided in the Indenture that, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the 2013 Notes, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except as provided in the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this 2013 Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future holders and owners of this 2013 Note and any 2013 Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this 2013 Note or such other 2013 Notes.
provided, however,
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this 2013 Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, this 2013 Note, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, upon the occurrence of a Designated Event, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such Holder's 2013 Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Designated Event Repurchase Date at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes such Holder elects to require the Company to repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Designated Event Repurchase Date. The Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of record of the 2013 Notes a notice of the occurrence of a Designated Event and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof on or before the twentieth day after the occurrence of any Designated Event.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, on and after September 1, 2013, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture and prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity, to convert any 2013 Notes or portion thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or Reference Property, in each case at the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture, upon surrender of this 2013 Note, together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is contained under Section 2.4 of the Indenture, as provided in the Indenture and this Security, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at the option of such Holder, the Corporate Trust Office, and, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this 2013 Note, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney.

Section 3.4 .
Global Securities; Non-global Securities; Book-entry Provisions
(1) Global Securities
(A) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated by the Company for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. The Company hereby appoints DTC as the Depositary.
 
(B) Except for exchanges of Global Securities for definitive, Non-global Securities at the sole discretion of the Company, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so or (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security. In such event, if a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate directing the authentication and delivery of Securities, will authenticate and deliver, Securities, in any authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.
(C) If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or canceled in whole, it shall be surrendered by or on behalf of the Depositary or its nominee to the Trustee, as Security Registrar, for exchange or cancellation, as provided in this Article III. If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or canceled in part, or if another Security is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in any Global Security, in each case, as provided in Section 3.5, then either (A) such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation, as provided in this Article, or (B) the principal amount thereof shall be reduced or increased by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged or canceled, or equal to the principal amount of such other Security to be so exchanged for a beneficial interest therein, as the case may be, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee, as Security Registrar, whereupon the Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, shall instruct the Depositary or its authorized representative to make a corresponding adjustment to its records. Upon any such surrender or adjustment of a Global Security, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 3.5(3) and as otherwise provided in this Article III, authenticate and deliver any Securities issuable in exchange for such Global Security (or any portion thereof) to or upon the order of, and registered in such names as may be directed by, the Depositary or its authorized representative. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive from the Depositary the names, addresses and tax identification numbers of the Persons in whose name the Securities are to be registered prior to such authentication and delivery. Upon the request of the Trustee in connection with the occurrence of any of the events specified in the preceding paragraph, the Company shall promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Securities that are not in the form of Global Securities. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon any order, direction or request of the Depositary or its authorized representative which is given or made pursuant to this Article if such order, direction or request is given or made in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.
 
(D) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Article or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a registered Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof, in which case such Security shall be authenticated and delivered in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.
(E) The Depositary or its nominee, as registered owner of a Global Security, shall be the Holder of such Global Security for all purposes under the Indenture and the Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security shall hold such interests pursuant to the Applicable Procedures. Accordingly, any such owner's beneficial interest in a Global Security will be shown only on, and the transfer of such interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee or its Agent Members and such owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be considered the owners or holders thereof.
(2) Non-global Securities. Securities issued upon the events described in Section 3.4(1)(B) shall be in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, and shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend if and as required by this Indenture.
Section 3.5 .
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange; Restrictions on Transfer
(1) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers and exchanges of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at an office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 10.2 for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and bearing such restrictive legends as may be required by this Indenture.
At the option of the Holder, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, pursuant to a Company Order, authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so
 
required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities except as provided in Section 3.6, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 8.5, or Section 12.2 (other than where the shares of Common Stock are to be issued or delivered in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security) not involving any transfer and other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection with any such transfer or exchange by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company.
(2) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers and exchanges of Securities and beneficial interests in a Global Security of the kinds specified in this Section 3.5(2) shall be made only in accordance with this Section 3.5(2).
Certain Transfers and Exchanges
(A) . In the event that Non-global Securities are to be issued pursuant to Section 3.4(1)(B) in connection with any transfer of Securities, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this Clause (2)(A) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Security Registrar, of (a) a Company Order from the Company directing the Trustee, as Security Registrar, to (i) authenticate and deliver one or more Securities of the same aggregate principal amount as the beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security to be transferred, such instructions to contain the name or names of the designated transferee or transferees, the authorized denomination or denominations of the Securities to be so issued and appropriate delivery instructions and (ii) decrease the beneficial interest of a specified Agent Member's account in a Restricted Global Security by a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Restricted Global Security, and (b) such other certifications, legal opinions or other information as the Company or the Trustee may reasonably require to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, then the Trustee, as Security Registrar, shall direct DTC or any other applicable Depositary to decrease the principal amount of the Restricted Global Security by the specified amount and authenticate and deliver Securities in accordance with such instructions from the Company as provided in Section 3.4(1)(C).
Restricted Global Security to Restricted Non-global Security
 
(B) . If the Holder of a Restricted Security (other than a Global Security) wishes at any time to transfer all or any portion of such Restricted Security to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this Clause (2)(B) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Security Registrar, of such Restricted Security as provided in Section 3.5(1) and instructions from the Company directing that a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security in a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Security be credited to a specified Agent Member's account, then the Trustee, as Security Registrar, shall cancel such Restricted Security (and issue a new Restricted Security in respect of any untransferred portion thereof) as provided in Section 3.5(1) and increase the principal amount of the Restricted Global Security by the specified principal amount as provided in Section 3.4(1)(C).
Restricted Non-global Security to Restricted Global Security
(C) . A beneficial interest in a Global Security may be exchanged for a Security that is not a Global Security only as provided in Section 3.4 or only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with Clause 2(A) above, that, if such interest is a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security, then such interest shall be exchanged for a Restricted Security (subject in each case to Section 3.5(3)). A Security that is not a Global Security may be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with Clause (2)(B) above.
Exchanges Between Global Security and Non-global Security
provided
(3) . All Securities issued pursuant to this Indenture, and all Successor Securities, shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend and shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer specified therein, subject to the following:
Securities Act Legends
(A) subject to the following Clauses of this Section 3.5(3), a Security or any portion thereof which is exchanged, upon transfer or otherwise, for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by such Global Security for which the Security was exchanged;
(B) subject to the following Clauses of this Section 3.5(3), a new Security that is not a Global Security and is issued in exchange for another Security (including a Global Security) or any portion thereof, upon transfer or otherwise, shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by the Security for which the new Security was exchanged;
(C) any Securities that are sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act (including the Shelf Registration Statement), together with their Successor Securities shall not bear a Restricted Securities Legend; the Company shall inform the Trustee in writing of the effective date of any such registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities Act and shall notify the Trustee at any time when prospectuses must be delivered with respect to Securities to be sold pursuant to such registration statement. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned registration statement;
 
(D) at any time after the Securities may be freely transferred without registration under the Securities Act or without being subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to the Securities Act, a new Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend may be issued in exchange for or in lieu of a Security (other than a Global Security) or any portion thereof that bears such a legend if the Trustee has received an Unrestricted Securities Certificate, satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by the Holder of such Security bearing a Restricted Securities Legend or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and after such date and receipt of such certificate, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such new Security in exchange for or in lieu of such other Security as provided in this Article III;
(E) a new Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend may be issued in exchange for or in lieu of a Security or any portion thereof that bears such a legend if, in the Company's judgment, placing such a legend upon such new Security is not necessary to ensure compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver such a new Security as provided in this Article III; and
(F) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5(3), a Successor Security of a Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend shall not bear such legend unless the Company has reasonable cause to believe that such Successor Security is a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144, in which case the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a new Security bearing a Restricted Securities Legend in exchange for such Successor Security as provided in this Article.
(4) Any stock certificate representing shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by such Securities, to the extent required by this Indenture, unless such shares of Common Stock have been sold pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act (and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer) or sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing with written notice thereof to the transfer agent for the Common Stock. With respect to the transfer of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities that are restricted hereunder, any deliveries of certificates, legal opinions or other instruments that would be required to be made to the Security Registrar in the case of a transfer of Securities, as described above, shall instead be made to the transfer agent for the Common Stock.
(5) Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor any of their agents shall (i) have any duty to monitor compliance with or with respect to any federal or state or other securities or tax laws or (ii) have any duty to obtain documentation on any transfers or exchanges other than as specifically required hereunder.
 
Section 3.6 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee:
(1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and
(2) such security or indemnity as may be satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion, but subject to any conversion rights, may, instead of issuing a new Security, make payment in full of such Security to the Holder thereof, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto (other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection therewith by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company) and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies of any Holder with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security, the date of the proposed payment and the Special Record Date, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. The Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at such Holder's address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing and following provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 5.2 .
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(8) or Section 5.1(9)) occurs and is continuing, then in every such case (except as provided in the immediately following paragraph) the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all such Securities of the applicable series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal and all accrued interest thereon shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(8) or Section 5.1(9) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of, and accrued interest on, all of the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other Act of the Holders or any act on the part of the Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(6) relating to the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 9.4 and for any failure by the Company to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act, shall for the first 60 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive Special Interest on the applicable series of Securities at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Securities. This Special Interest will be in addition to any Special Interest that may accrue and be payable under the Registration Rights Agreement and will be payable in the same manner as Special Interest accruing under the Registration Rights Agreement. The Special Interest will accrue on all Outstanding Securities of the applicable series from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the obligations under Section 9.4 or the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act first occurs to but not including the 60
th
day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such obligations shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.13). On such 60
th
day (or earlier, if such Event of Default is cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.13 prior to such 60
th
day), such Special Interest will cease to accrue and, if such Event of Default has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.13 prior to such 60th day, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest on all such Securities to be due and payable immediately. This provision shall not affect the rights of Holders in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default and shall have no effect on the rights of Holders under the Registration Rights Agreement; ,, that in no event will the rate of Special Interest accruing on either series of Securities pursuant to this Section 5.2 and the Registration Rights Agreement at any time exceed 0.50% per annum in the aggregate. If the Company elects to pay Special Interest as the sole remedy for an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(6) relating to the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 9.4 and for any failure by the Company to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Company shall notify, in the manner provided for in Section 1.6, the Holders and the Trustee of such election at any time on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. If Special Interest is payable under this Section 5.2, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate to that effect stating (i) the amount of Special Interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which Special Interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives at the Corporate Trust Office such a certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Special Interest is payable. If Special Interest has been paid by the Company directly to the persons entitled to them, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.

This Section 5.2, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities of a series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Securities of such series and the principal of any and all Securities of such series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest (to the extent that payment of such
 
interest is enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Securities during the period of such default) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.7, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all Events of Defaults under this Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.13, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Securities and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. No rescission or annulment referred to above shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.3 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest (including any Special Interest) and interest on any overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on any overdue interest (including any Special Interest), at the rate borne by the Securities, and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and take such other actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any official committee of creditors appointed in such matter, and to file such other papers or documents, in each of the foregoing cases, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such proceeding; , , that the Trustee may, on behalf of such Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official.

If, at any time after the Trading Price Condition has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the applicable series of Securities is greater than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Securities and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date, the Company shall so notify the Holders of the applicable series of Securities, and the Trustee shall have no further obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Securities unless requested by the Company to do so again in writing pursuant to this Section 12.1(a)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Trustee cannot reasonably obtain at least one bid for $2.0 million in principal amount of the applicable series of Securities from a nationally recognized securities dealer for the purpose of determining the Trading Price on any Trading Day, then that series of Securities shall not be convertible pursuant to this Section 12.1(a)(1) with respect to the Measurement Period containing such Trading Day (any such determination by the Trustee will be conclusive absent manifest error).
(2) The 2011 Notes shall be convertible prior to September 1, 2011, and the 2013 Notes shall be convertible prior to September 1, 2013, during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2006, if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for twenty (20) or more Trading Days in a period of thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
 
(3) The 2011 Notes shall be convertible prior to September 1, 2011, and the 2013 Notes shall be convertible prior to September 1, 2013, as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section.
(b) In the event that the Company elects to:
(1) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at a price less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution; or
(2) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets (including cash) or debt securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value (as determined by the Board of Directors) exceeding 15% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution,
then, in either case, Holders may surrender the Securities for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to Holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify Holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (1) or clause (2) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 25
th
scheduled Trading Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. A Holder may not exercise this right if such Holder is permitted to participate in the distribution on an as-converted basis without having to convert its Securities.
(c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the Holders shall have the right to convert Securities at any time beginning 15 calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is 15 calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction; such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section shall apply. The Company will notify Holders at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th calendar day prior to such anticipated effective date.
provided
 
(d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a Holder may surrender Securities for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the Holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in subsection (e) of this Section; , that no increase will be made in the case of a Fundamental Change if (i) at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock or American Depositary Receipts in respect of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange or a U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on another established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and as a result of such transaction or transactions the Securities become convertible into such shares of such capital stock or such American Depositary Receipts or (ii) the Company elects to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation in connection with a Public Acquirer Change in Control pursuant to subsection (e)(4) of this Section. The Company shall notify, in the manner provided for in Section 1.6, each of the Holders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event. If the Designated Event constitutes a Fundamental Change, such notice shall also state whether such Fundamental Change will also constitute a Public Acquirer Change in Control and whether the Company will elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation pursuant to subsection (e)(4) of this Section.
provided
however
(e) Subject to subsection (d) of this Section, if a Holder elects to convert Securities in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to Stated Maturity, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "Additional Shares") as described below. Settlement of Securities tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 12.2(d). For purposes of this subsection (e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection with" a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in subsection (d) of this Section (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(1), (a)(2), (b) or (c) of this Section shall apply to such conversion).
(2) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by the Company by reference to the tables attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "Effective Date"), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; further that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $40.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in
provided
provided
 
Section 12.4), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (2) the Stock Price is less than $12.61 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 12.4), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 79.3021 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 12.4).
(3) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the tables in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Securities is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 12.4 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).
(4) In the event of a Fundamental Change constituting a Public Acquirer Change in Control, the Company may, in lieu of adjusting the applicable Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection (e), elect, by giving notice in writing to all Holders and the Trustee of such election in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section, to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation such that from and after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control, Holders shall be entitled to convert their Securities (subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions to conversion set forth under this Article XII) into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock, subject to the arrangements for payment upon conversion pursuant to Section 12.2, at a Conversion Rate equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Public Acquirer Change in Control multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be (i) in the case of a share exchange, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property, the average value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our Board of Directors) paid or payable per share of Common Stock or (ii) in the case of any other Public Acquirer Change in Control, the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control, and the denominator of which shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control.
Section 12.2 .
Exercise of Conversion Privilege
(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this Section, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares
 
of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 12.3. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
(2) If the Company elects to pay cash in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock, the Company shall notify, in the manner provided for in Section 1.6, the Holder tendering a Notice of Conversion of the percentage of each share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion that will be paid in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock (the "Cash Percentage") at any time on or before the close of business on the Trading Date following the Company's receipt of the Notice of Conversion tendered by such Holder. In the event the Company elects to settle in cash all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion in connection with conversions of a series of Securities within 30 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such series of Securities, the Company shall send, on or prior to the 30
th
scheduled Trading Date prior to the applicable Stated Maturity, a single notice for all such conversions to the Trustee with respect to the Cash Percentage that will be paid in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions described above in this subsection (a), in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation, the Company may direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior to the commencement of the Observation Period, such Securities to a financial institution designated by the Company for exchange in lieu of conversion. In order to accept any Securities surrendered for conversion, the designated institution must agree to deliver, in exchange for such Securities, all cash and, if applicable, the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock equal to the consideration due upon conversion pursuant to this Section 12.2, at the sole option of the designated financial institution and as is designated to the Conversion Agent by the Company. By the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the start of the Observation Period, the Company shall notify, in the manner provided in Section 1.6, the Holder surrendering Securities for conversion that the Company has directed the designated financial institution to make an exchange in lieu of conversion and such financial institution shall be required to notify the Conversion Agent whether it will deliver, upon exchange, all cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. If the designated institution accepts any such Securities, it will deliver cash and, if applicable, the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 12.2(d). Any Securities exchanged by the designated institution shall remain outstanding. If the designated institution agrees to accept any Securities for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration, or if such designated financial institution does not accept the Securities for exchange, the Company shall, no later than the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, convert the Securities into cash and, if applicable, the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock due upon conversion pursuant to this Section 12.2.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in
 
Section 12.1(e) pursuant to this clause (b); , the Company may elect to pay cash to Holders of Securities surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation pursuant to clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section.
provided
(1) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Securities surrendered for conversion is prior to the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion as described in this subsection (b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 12.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to be paid to Holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
(2) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Securities surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion as described in Section 12.1(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 12.1(e)) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
(c) Before any Holder of a Security shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in subsection (i) of this Section and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Security issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form set forth under Section 2.4 (or a facsimile thereof) (a "Notice of Conversion") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in
 
subsection (i) of this Section, and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Security shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "Conversion Date") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this subsection (c).
No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Securities may be tendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.1.
If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Securities, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in subsection (a) of this Section, except to the extent specified in subsection (b) of this Section. The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Holder of the Security surrendered for conversion, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to such Holder, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
(e) In case any Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, as provided in a Company Order, authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder, a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities.
(f) If a Holder submits a Security for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Company may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Company receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
(g) Except as provided in Section 12.4, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Security as provided in this Article.
(h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Securities effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
 
(i) Upon conversion, a Holder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Security and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Securities are converted after the close of business on a record date, Holders of such Securities as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Securities on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Securities so converted; , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Security; or (iii) with respect to any Conversion Date that occurs during the period from the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding Stated Maturity to Stated Maturity. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Securities.
provided, however
(j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; that no surrender of Securities on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Securities shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Securities, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of Securities surrendered for conversion.
provided, however,
(k) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon such conversion of Restricted Securities shall bear restrictive legends substantially in the form of the legends required to be set forth on the Restricted Securities pursuant to Section 3.5 and shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in such legends. Neither the Trustee nor any agent maintained for the purpose of such conversion shall have any responsibility for the inclusion or content of any such restrictive legends on such Common Stock; , , that the Trustee or any agent maintained for the purpose of such conversion shall have provided, to the Company or to the Company's transfer agent for such Common Stock, prior to or concurrently with a request to the Company to deliver such Common Stock, written notice that the Securities delivered for conversion are Restricted Securities.
provided

Section 12.3 .
Fractions of Shares
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security or Securities. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Security or Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall calculate and pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the relevant Observation Period.
Section 12.4 .
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
(a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event; and
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Stockholder Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 12.4(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
 
(b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights, warrants or convertible securities entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights; and
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, warrants or convertible securities divided by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution for the issuance of such rights or warrants.
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Stockholder Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
(c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by subsection (a) of this Section), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by subsection (b) or (d) of this Section and distributions described below in this subsection (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this subsection (c) called the "Distributed Property"), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
SP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution; and
FMV = the fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP
provided
0
as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Stockholder Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this subsection (c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP
0
above.
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this subsection (c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stockholder Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such Stockholder Record Date;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such Stockholder Record Date;
FMV
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period after the effective date of the spin-off; and
MP
0
= the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock over the first ten (10) consecutive trading-day period after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
Such adjustment shall occur on the 10
th
Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.
Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this subsection (c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence)
 
with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of this subsection (c), and subsections (a) and (b) of this Section, any dividend or distribution to which this subsection (c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which subsection (a) of this Section applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which subsection (a) or (b) of this Section applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which this subsection (c) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this subsection (c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Stockholder Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of this Section and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of subsection (a) of this Section.
(d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
SP
0
= the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution; and
 
C = the amount in cash per share we distribute to holders of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stockholder Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP
provided
0
as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Security (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Stockholder Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subsection (d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Securities become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this subsection (d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Securities are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
(e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration as determined by the Board of Directors paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires; and
SP' = the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
Such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formulae would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
For purposes of this Section the term "Stockholder Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
(f) In addition to those required by subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the Security Register provided for in Section 1.6 a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(g) All calculations and other determinations under this Article shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Designated Event, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
 
(h) In any case in which this Section provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section, or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section (each an "Adjustment Determination Date"), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the Holder of any Security converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 12.3. For purposes of this subsection (i), the term "Adjustment Event" shall mean:
(i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
(iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
(iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
(i) For purposes of this Section, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
(j) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Securities prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the Holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
Section 12.5 .
Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Rate
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided:
(1) the Company shall compute the adjusted Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 12.4 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall promptly be filed with the Trustee and with each Conversion Agent; and
 
(2) upon each such adjustment, a notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall be required, and as soon as practicable after it is required, such notice shall be provided by the Company to all Holders in accordance with Section 1.6

Notice of Certain Corporate Action
In case:
(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 12.4; or
(b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants, or
(c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at his address appearing on the Security Register, provided for in Section 1.6, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 10 days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below, as the case may be, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
 
Section 12.7 .
Company to Reserve Common Stock
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Securities, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Securities.
Section 12.8 .
Taxes on Conversions
Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company will pay any and all taxes and duties that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of (i) income of the Holder, or (ii) any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or duty, or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax or duty has been paid.
Section 12.9 .
Certain Covenants
(a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will take all corporate action which it reasonably determines may be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
(b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the SEC (or any successor thereto) or such other applicable governmental authority, to secure such registration or approval in connection with the conversion of Securities.
(c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities.
 
Section 12.10 .
Cancellation of Converted Securities
All Securities delivered for conversion shall be delivered to the Trustee or its agent and canceled by the Trustee as provided in Section 3.9.
Section 12.11 .
Provision in Case of Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
If any of the following events occur, namely (A) (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in any case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event described in clauses (i) through (iii) a "Merger Event") or (B) any Public Acquirer Change in Control whereby the Company elects to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation pursuant to Section 12.1(e)(4), then:
(a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person or acquirer, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 8.1(7) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of (i) any Merger Event or (ii) Public Acquirer Change in Control whereby the Company elects to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation pursuant to Section 12.1(e)(4), the Reference Property or Public Acquirer Common Stock, as the case may be, includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change of control, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other company and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV.
In the event a supplemental indenture is executed pursuant to this Section, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or assets that will constitute the Reference Property or Public Acquirer Common Stock, as the case may be, after any such Merger Event or Public Acquirer Change in Control whereby the Company elects to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation pursuant to Section 12.1(e)(4), any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.
 
If any securities to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such securities may be validly issued upon conversion, each supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Section shall provide that the Company or the successor or the purchasing Person or acquirer, as the case may be, or if the Reference Property or Public Acquirer Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, then such company, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the SEC (or any successor thereto), to secure such registration or approval in connection with the conversion of Securities.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.2(a) and Section 12.2(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 12.1, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Securities will be changed to a right to convert such Security by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "Reference Property") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Holder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Securities into cash and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 12.2(a). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Securities to convert its Securities in accordance with the provisions of this Article prior to the effective date.
(c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at his address appearing on the Security Register provided for in this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
Section 12.12 .
Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any
 
facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether a supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property or cash, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make or calculate any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or share certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.

Defeasance and Discharge
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.3 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 13.3 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Section 3.4, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 10.2, Section 10.3 and Article XII, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article.

(3) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such Securities, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit.
(4) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Section 5.1(7) and (8), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
(5) Such Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act).
(6) Such Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.
(7) Such Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under the Investment Company Act or exempt from registration thereunder.
(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance have been complied with.

Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 13.3 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance with respect to such Securities.
Section 13.5 .
Reinstatement
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 13.2 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 13.4 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; , , that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

Section 14.1 .
Right to Require Repurchase Upon a Designated Event
(a) If a Designated Event occurs at any time, then each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such Holder's Securities or any portion thereof that is a multiple of $1,000 principal amount, for cash on the date (the "Designated Event Repurchase Date") specified by the Company that is not less than twenty (20) days and not more than thirty five (35) calendar days after the date of the Designated Event Company Notice (as defined below) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Designated Event Repurchase Date (subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant Record Date to receive interest on the corresponding Interest Payment Date) (the "Designated Event Repurchase Price").
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Holders shall not have the right to require the Company to repurchase any Securities under this Section (and the Company shall not be required to deliver the Designated Event Repurchase Notice incidental thereto) if at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in the case of a Fundamental Change consists of shares of Capital Stock or American Depositary Receipts in respect of shares of
 
Capital Stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on an established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or will be so traded or quoted immediately following the Fundamental Change) and, as a result of such transaction or transactions, the Securities become convertible into such shares of such Capital Stock or such American Depositary Receipts.
Repurchases of Securities under this Section shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof, upon:

(ii) delivery or book-entry transfer of the Securities to the Trustee (or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company) at any time after delivery of the Designated Event Repurchase Notice (together with all necessary endorsements) at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee (or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company) in the Borough of Manhattan, such delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Designated Event Repurchase Price therefor; that such Designated Event Repurchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section only if the Security so delivered to the Trustee (or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company) shall conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related Designated Event Repurchase Notice.

Contribution
 
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Electing Holders or any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 5(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Electing Holders and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals in this Section 5(e) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the percentage of principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, in no event will any (i) Electing Holder be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 5 for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Holder from the sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities are to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional be required to undertake liability to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the discount, commission or other compensation payable to such underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional with respect to the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public.
(g) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and the obligations of any Indemnified Person under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which such Indemnified Person may otherwise have to the Company. The remedies provided in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity.

The Holders participating in any underwritten offering shall be responsible for any underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and, subject to Section 4 hereof, expenses of their own counsel. The Company shall pay all expenses customarily borne by issuers in an underwritten offering, including but not limited to filing fees, the fees and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants and any printing expenses incurred in connection with such underwritten offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of Section 3(n) hereof, upon receipt of a request from the Managing Underwriter or a representative of holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be included in an underwritten offering to prepare and file an amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus in connection with an underwritten offering, the Company may delay the filing of any such amendment or supplement for up to 90 days if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith that the Company has a bona fide business reason for such delay.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On October 17, 2006, EMC announced plans to implement consolidation efforts designed to deliver a more unified experience to customers through the further integration of EMC and most of the 21 acquisitions made over the past three years by improving efficiencies across the company's business. As of such date, the actions were expected to result in the departure of approximately 1,250 employees worldwide by the end of 2007. The plan was expected to result in a pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 of between $150 million and $175 million or $0.06 per diluted share to cover the cost of the consolidation efforts.
On December 29, 2006, EMC management approved a final consolidation plan as follows:
 
 
 
The total pre-tax charge is approximately $175 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 23, 2007  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported all-time record revenue and strong profit growth for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2006. EMC's 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth was highlighted by better-than-expected revenue and profit performance.
Total consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $3.215 billion, 19% higher than the $2.710 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $55 million more than the fourth-quarter revenue forecast provided by EMC in October 2006.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $389 million or $0.18 per diluted share, which includes a $0.06 per share restructuring charge, a $0.05 per share tax benefit related to prior years and a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the first three quarters of 2006. Excluding these items, net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $0.17 per share, $0.02 higher than the fourth quarter forecast provided by EMC in October 2006. GAAP reported fourth-quarter net income for 2005 was $148 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2006 fiscal year was a record $11.155 billion, 15% higher than the $9.664 billion reported for the full 2005 fiscal year.
GAAP net income for 2006 was $1.22 billion or $0.54 per diluted share. Excluding special items discussed below diluted earnings per share for 2006 also was $0.54. GAAP reported net income for 2005 was $1.13 billion or $0.47 per diluted share. Adjusting for special items in both years, and had stock options been expensed in 2005, diluted earnings per share would have increased 35% to $0.54 in 2006 from the $0.40 diluted earnings per share in 2005.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC had another record quarter and a solid finish to 2006. We have now delivered strong, double-digit revenue growth for four straight years and we are well positioned to do it again in 2007."
"EMC has clearly joined the short list of the world's elite information technology suppliers that organizations around the world choose to partner with to drive their business," Tucci continued. "We have focused our entire company on information infrastructure, enabling our customers to put their information to work and better leverage its value. We begin 2007 with the technology
portfolio, the strategy and, most importantly, the trust of our customers to help them solve their most pressing issues and gain an even greater share of our $60 billion market opportunity."
During the fourth quarter, EMC achieved double-digit revenue growth across its systems, software and services offerings, and across all four of its major geographies. EMC systems revenue grew 12%; software license and maintenance revenue increased 27%; and professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue increased 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Quarterly revenue from North America was up 18%; revenues from Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 22%; revenue from Latin America increased 14%; and revenue from the Asia Pacific and Japan region returned to double-digit growth, increasing 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2005.
EMC completed the fourth quarter with $5.6 billion in cash and investments. In 2006 the company spent approximately $3.8 billion to purchase 302 million EMC shares and to redeem $125 million in convertible debt.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Looking across our business, we are pleased with how well we performed in the quarter. We achieved solid top- and bottom-line growth, gained market share across each of our four business units, and delivered double-digit revenue growth across all four of our major geographies. We are poised for continued momentum in 2007 as we address our customers' most critical IT priorities."
Fourth-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Storage business, which comprises storage systems, information management, information protection and resource management software, and related customer and professional services, increased revenue 9% compared with the year-ago quarter to $2.67 billion on continued demand for the new EMC CLARiiON CX3 UltraScale and EMC Symmetrix DMX-3 networked storage systems. EMC Rainfinity File Virtualization software revenue more than doubled as more and more organizations turned to file virtualization to improve the management and utilization of files and global file systems. EMC Smarts and EMC Networker software continued to gain share on solid, double-digit license revenue growth, reflecting strong customer adoption of EMC's broad portfolio of resource management and backup and recovery software.
The EMC Content Management and Archiving business grew 43% compared with the year-ago quarter to a record $203 million. EMC continues to expand its lead in enterprise content management, as more organizations turn to EMC Documentum software to effectively manage their increasing volumes of unstructured information.
Information security revenues for the fourth quarter  the first full quarter of operations for RSA, the Security Division of EMC  grew 26% to $114 million compared with the results reported by the division's constituent companies (RSA Security and Network Intelligence) in the year-ago period. The division's strong performance reflected continued traction for RSA's consumer identity protection solutions as a result of federal guidelines for stronger authentication practices in online banking and concerns over credit card fraud and identity theft. It also demonstrates the early post-acquisition progress that has been made in integrating the division's operations and customers' enthusiastic response to EMC's information-centric approach to securing business information.
 
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, had its 31st consecutive record quarter and grew total revenues 101% year-over-year to $232 million. VMware has delivered accelerating year-over-year growth for the past five quarters. VMware's exceptional performance was fueled by rapid customer adoption of VMware Infrastructure 3, which began shipping in June 2006. VMware's fourth-quarter momentum and expanding customer base were driven in part by the release of 64-bit support for VMware Infrastructure 3, VMware Lab Manager  an automation suite designed to improve software development processes, and a new virtual appliance marketplace and certification program now delivering more than 380 virtual appliances.
2006 Highlights
EMC had double-digit revenue growth across its systems, software and services offerings in 2006 as organizations turned to EMC's portfolio to better store, protect, optimize and leverage their expanding volumes of information in increasingly complex IT environments.
Systems revenue grew 15% during the year to $5.14 billion, helped by the introduction of new models and enhancements to EMC's entire line of networked storage platforms. Software license and maintenance revenue grew 20% to a record $4.27 billion. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 10% in 2006, as more customers engaged EMC Global Services professionals to help plan, build, manage and support their information infrastructures.
EMC's Information Storage business annual revenue increased 9% in 2006 to $9.6 billion, driven in large part by EMC Symmetrix systems, which had their strongest growth in six years. Annual revenue for EMC's Content Management and Archiving business grew 42% compared to 2005. Had EMC owned RSA and Network Intelligence for all of 2005 and 2006, 2006 annual revenues for the RSA security division would have been up 26% year over year. VMware revenue also achieved accelerated revenue growth throughout the year, increasing revenues 83% to $709 million for 2006.

This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (ix) war or acts of terrorism; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation for the diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2005 and diluted earnings per share for 2006 and 2005 are in the tables entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data" for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 attached to this release. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
As specified, certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2006" are adjusted for restructuring charges and the tax impact of such restructuring charges and certain tax benefits. Where specified, in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Year Ended December 31, 2006," in-process research and development charges, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax benefits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in such schedule. In addition, stock option expense was included, and in-process research and development charges, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2005" where specified. Stock option expense was included, and in-process research and development charges, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Year Ended December 31, 2005" where specified. Stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax benefits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2006" where specified. Finally, stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization, in-process research and development, restructuring charges, the related tax impact and certain tax benefits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Year Ended December 31, 2006" where specified.
 
EMC's management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above listed expenses from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation, intangible amortization, in-process research and development, restructuring charges, the related tax impact of each and certain tax charges and benefits, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., and HOPKINTON, Mass.  February 7, 2007  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced its intention to sell approximately 10% of VMware via an initial public offering (IPO) of newly issued VMware stock. EMC will retain ownership of the remaining shares of VMware, and has no intention of spinning out or otherwise divesting this ownership interest. VMware is the global leader in software for industry-standard virtualized desktops and servers and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of EMC.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "VMware is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the history of the software industry. We expect the IPO to unlock more of VMware's value for EMC shareholders while also strengthening its ability to retain and attract the software industry's top talent."
VMware had record sales in 2006, growing revenues 83% during the year to $709 million. It finished the fourth quarter of 2006 with year-over-year revenue growth of 101%, delivering accelerating year-over-year growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Diane Greene, VMware President and EMC Executive Vice President, said, "VMware has secured its leadership position in the virtualization market through industry-leading and award-winning products. Our focus on people, innovation, and the customer adoption of our products has enabled us to continue to grow our company and deliver significant value. We expect that the IPO will help us execute on our vision of an industry standard virtual infrastructure. It should enable us to accelerate our ability to find and attract great people, continue to invest in great product development, and grow an even stronger partner ecosystem."
VMware's products have saved organizations of virtually all sizes and industries millions of dollars in hardware and operational expenses, power and cooling costs, reduced downtime expenses, and improved desktop manageability. VMware has brought these
savings to customers through innovative and groundbreaking products that have a reputation for quality and excellence. In 2006, VMware received 30 awards for innovation and product excellence, including eWEEK's award for being one of the most 25 influential products of the past 25 years.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The proceeds from this transaction are expected to provide VMware with the financial resources it needs to achieve its full growth potential. The IPO is also expected to provide EMC with the potential to return a portion of the original investment in VMware to EMC shareholders, while enabling them to retain majority ownership in this strategic EMC business."
EMC believes the IPO, which is expected to occur this summer, will provide both EMC and VMware with a number of significant advantages including:
 
 
 
Tucci continued, "We are dedicated to VMware's open platform strategy and partnerships with industry-leading technology companies both large and small. VMware's open platform strategy is critical to the growth of virtual infrastructure as an industry standard layer that benefits all customers and partners."
The IPO is not expected to have a material impact on EMC's 2007 business outlook. VMware will be a publicly traded entity upon completion of the transaction. Tucci and Greene are expected to be named to VMware's Board of Directors.
Conference Call Details
Tucci, Greene and Goulden will discuss today's announcement on a conference call for financial analysts, investors and the news media at 5:00 p.m. EST, today. The dial-in number is 1-517-308-9124. The pass code to access the call is EMC. A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour following the call at 402-220-2193.

We expect that the IPO will help us execute on our vision of an industry standard virtual infrastructure. It should enable us to accelerate our ability to find and attract great people, continue to invest in great product development, and grow an even stronger partner ecosystem."
VMware's products have saved organizations of virtually all sizes and industries millions of dollars in hardware and operational expenses, power and cooling costs, reduced downtime expenses, and improved desktop manageability. VMware has brought these
savings to customers through innovative and groundbreaking products that have a reputation for quality and excellence. In 2006, VMware received 30 awards for innovation and product excellence, including eWEEK's award for being one of the most 25 influential products of the past 25 years.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The proceeds from this transaction are expected to provide VMware with the financial resources it needs to achieve its full growth potential. The IPO is also expected to provide EMC with the potential to return a portion of the original investment in VMware to EMC shareholders, while enabling them to retain majority ownership in this strategic EMC business."
EMC believes the IPO, which is expected to occur this summer, will provide both EMC and VMware with a number of significant advantages including:
 
 
 
Tucci continued, "We are dedicated to VMware's open platform strategy and partnerships with industry-leading technology companies both large and small. VMware's open platform strategy is critical to the growth of virtual infrastructure as an industry standard layer that benefits all customers and partners."
The IPO is not expected to have a material impact on EMC's 2007 business outlook. VMware will be a publicly traded entity upon completion of the transaction. Tucci and Greene are expected to be named to VMware's Board of Directors.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  March 5, 2007  EMC Corporation, the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, announced today that Vice Chairman Bill Teuber will expand his responsibilities to include leadership of the company's Customer Operations, its worldwide sales and distribution organization. Teuber assists EMC Chairman, President and CEO Joe Tucci in the day-to-day management of EMC, and he formerly served as EMC's Chief Financial Officer for nearly 10 years before being named Vice Chairman in May 2006.
EMC also announced today that Bill Scannell, a 20-year EMC veteran who heads up sales for the Americas, has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Global Sales Programs in addition to heading up sales for the Americas. Scannell will report to Teuber, as will Rainer Erlat, EMC President of Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Steve Leonard, EMC President of Asia Pacific and Japan. Additionally, Senior Vice Presidents Mike DeCesare and Balaji Yelamanchili have been named co-General Managers for EMC's Content Management and Archive business reporting directly to Joe Tucci.

Bill Teuber is extremely well prepared to assume leadership of our worldwide sales and distribution organization and already spends nearly half of his time with EMC customers. Collectively, this group forms a powerful team with a long track record of proven success. David's departure is very amicable. We thank him for his contributions over the past three years and wish him well.
"EMC has great momentum going into 2007, and we are well positioned for an excellent year," continued Tucci.

Date: April 17, 2007
 
 

HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 17, 2007  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported record first-quarter revenue and strong profit growth. Highlights of the quarter included increased demand for VMware virtual infrastructure solutions and RSA information security software and accelerating growth in the company's Asia-Pacific and Japan operations.
Total consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2007 was $2.98 billion, 17% higher than the $2.55 billion reported for the first quarter of 2006.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2007 was $312.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share, which included a $0.01 per diluted share tax benefit. GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was 36% higher than the GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.11 reported for the year-ago period.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC is off to a solid start in 2007. Customers around the globe continue to embrace our information infrastructure solutions to help store, protect, optimize and leverage their corporate information. We have an established leadership position in the areas of the IT market that CIOs prioritize most. Our first-quarter performance and our focus on integration and execution place us firmly on track to meet our financial targets for 2007."
Tucci continued, "For more than two decades, EMC has been the trusted caretaker of information, partnering with the world's largest companies and government institutions. Our greatest opportunity and competitive advantages lie in the value realized by our customers when our products come together in a unified information infrastructure to solve today's information management issues, better leverage information's value and reduce the costs associated with its explosive growth."
Compared with the first quarter of 2006, EMC systems revenue, which represents 44% of total first-quarter revenue, increased 6%; software license and maintenance revenue, which represents 40% of total revenue, increased 29%; and professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue, which represents 16% of total revenue, grew by 21%. First-quarter revenue from North America increased 16% compared with the same period a year ago, and represents 58% of total reported revenue. First-quarter revenue from customers outside of North
America grew 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit revenue growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and across the Asia-Pacific region.
Tucci continued, "I am pleased with the improvements in our Asia-Pacific and Japan operations. After strengthening our executive management team in the region about a year ago, our business in that part of the world is back on track, delivering first-quarter revenue growth of nearly 30%. A strong focus on execution and a reinvigorated partner strategy have helped our business in the APJ region expand significantly faster than the overall market and re-emerge as our fastest-growing geography."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Looking across EMC's lines of business and major geographies, we are pleased with our first-quarter performance and our balanced systems, software and services revenue mix. The breadth, quality and diversity of our information infrastructure portfolio is differentiating EMC in the marketplace and strengthening our financial model. We are on pace to grow as fast or faster than the major markets we serve and to gain share of our expanding $60 billion worldwide market opportunity."
Goulden added, "During the quarter, EMC generated strong operating cash flow of $809 million, an increase of 27%, and strong free cash flow of $586 million, an increase of 37%, compared with the same period last year. We continue to believe share buybacks are an effective way to deploy our growing cash balance and return value to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we spent $489 million to buy back approximately 35 million EMC shares."
First-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, information management, information protection and resource management software, and related customer and professional services, reached $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Growth in the Information Storage business reflects continued global demand for EMC's networked storage products and related professional services, for EMC's industry-leading resource management and file virtualization software, and for EMC's comprehensive approach to information protection and recovery management.
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, again achieved record quarterly revenue, growing sales 95% year-over-year to $256 million during the first quarter and placing the company's revenue on an annualized run rate of more than $1 billion. VMware showed continued growth as organizations of various sizes and across numerous industries increasingly standardize on VMware virtual infrastructure for server consolidation and containment, software lifecycle automation, business continuity and desktop manageability and security. VMware and its products received numerous industry accolades during the quarter: VMware Infrastructure 3 received the " Technology of the year Award," the SearchWinComputing. com "Disaster Recovery Product of the Year Award" and the "Best of the New Data Center Award"; VMware Lab Manager won the 2007 Jolt Product Excellence Award; and named VMware a "top company to watch" in 2007.

In the first quarter, EMC announced its intention to sell approximately 10% of VMware via an initial public offering (IPO) of newly issued VMware stock. EMC expects the IPO will unlock more of VMware's value for EMC shareholders, strengthen VMware's ability to retain and attract the software industry's top talent, and reinforce EMC's commitment to VMware's open platform strategy.
 
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business grew first-quarter revenue to $172 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Maintenance and professional services revenue for the Content Management and Archiving business grew 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong license growth in 2006. Businesses around the world are relying on EMC's industry-leading content management and archiving solutions for a robust, unified repository, as well as for content and process services to automate their entire business process, ensuring compliance and making it easier to find information within or outside the organization. In the first quarter, EMC announced the availability of the EMC Documentum Process Suite, a comprehensive business process management (BPM) solution for analyzing, modeling, orchestrating and optimizing a wide range of enterprise processes involving people, systems, content and data. The introduction marks the integration of the software gained from EMC's June 2006 acquisition of Proactivity Inc., with EMC's existing Documentum business process management capabilities.
Information Security revenues for the first quarter  the second full quarter of operation for RSA, the Security Division of EMC  grew 25% to $120 million compared with the results reported by the division's constituent companies (RSA Security and Network Intelligence) in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the division attracted more than 1,200 new customers. These results reflect the value of the combined EMC and RSA technology portfolios and RSA's sustained strength within the enterprise, where the focus on identity assurance and robust access controls continues to grow. In addition, the division's consumer identity protection, data security, and information and event management solutions also reported strong year-on-year growth.

This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) risks associated with the VMware IPO, including the inability to manage successfully and complete the IPO, and risks associated with trading of VMware stock if the IPO is completed; (v) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vi) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vii) component and product quality and availability; (viii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (ix) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (x) war or acts of terrorism; (xi) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2007," stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization and certain tax benefits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, where specified in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2006," stock option expense, restricted stock expense and intangible amortization are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed expenses (stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization and certain tax benefits) from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. For the first quarter of 2007, free cash flow equals $586.3 million and is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities (as defined by GAAP) of $808.7 million minus additions to property plant and equipment of $170.5 million minus capitalized software development costs of $51.9 million. For the first quarter of 2006, free cash flow equals $427.8 million and is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities (as defined by GAAP) of $637.2 million minus additions to property plant and equipment of $160.5 million minus capitalized software development costs of $48.9 million. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization and certain tax benefits, do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation, intangible amortization and certain tax charges and benefits, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.July 24, 2007EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported record second-quarter revenue and strong profit growth marked by double-digit revenue growth in its systems, software and services businesses and across all major geographies. EMC has now delivered double-digit top-line growth for 16 consecutive quarters.
Total consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2007 was $3.12 billion, 21% higher than the $2.57 billion reported for the second quarter of 2006. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $334.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share, 33% higher than the GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.12 reported for the year-ago period. EMC generated strong operating cash flow of $622 million, an increase of 59%, and free cash flow of $422 million, an increase of 123%, compared with the same period a year ago.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC executed well in the second quarter. Customers continued to choose EMC for the depth and breadth of our information infrastructure technologies and solutions, which translated into solid revenue growth that was well balanced across our systems, software and services businesses and all major geographies. Add to this the explosion of digital information and the positive 2007 IT spending outlook we see in all major geographies, and it is clear that we are in a sweet spot of the IT industry."
Compared with the second quarter of 2006, EMC systems revenue increased 18% year-over-year, led by strong revenue growth from the company's mid-range information storage products. EMC systems revenue represented 43% of total second-quarter revenue. Software license and maintenance revenue increased 27% year-over-year, led by strong customer demand for RSA's security offerings and for VMware Virtual Infrastructure. Software license and maintenance revenue accounted for 41% of total revenue in the quarter. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew by 18%, driven by double-digit services growth in all four major EMC business segments. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services represented 16% of total second-quarter revenue.
For the second-quarter of 2007, revenue from North America increased 20% compared with the same period a year ago and represented 58% of total reported revenue. Revenue from operations outside of North America grew 23% year-over-year, highlighted by double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in EMC's major international regions: Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Latin America and Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ). APJ, which experienced 32% revenue growth year-over-year, retained its distinction as EMC's fastest-growing major international region for the second straight quarter.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Looking across our business, we remain pleased with our strong, balanced performance and the progress EMC is making towards its 2007 operational and financial goals. We believe we are now on track to exceed the annual targets we set in January, as we continue to execute on our plan to help customers address their information infrastructure requirements."
Second-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, information management, information protection and resource management software, and related customer and professional services, reached $2.5 billion, an increase of 12% compared with the year-ago quarter. The second-quarter momentum was led by double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in EMC CLARiiON networked storage systems and solid customer demand for EMC's backup to disk offerings. EMC also announced deeper technology integration across its product portfolio, including EMC Avamar data protection software optimized with VMware and EMC Celerra, and EMC RecoverPoint replication technology with EMC Replication Manager software.
RSA Information Security revenues for the second quarter of 2007 grew 21% when compared with the results of the division's constituent companies in the year-ago period and generated approximately $125 million in revenue. The information security business continued to do well during the quarter due to significant success in Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) initiatives and notable demand across multiple industries for stronger authentication requirements. Also during the quarter, the division experienced strong growth in alternative forms of authentication, which include software tokens and smart cards, as well as in its information and event management offerings, consumer-facing applications, and encryption and key management solutions.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business grew second-quarter revenue to $174 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year. In May 2007, EMC announced the availability of EMC Documentum TaskSpace  a new, highly configurable user interface for the next-generation EMC Documentum 6 enterprise content management (ECM) platform. Next week, EMC will formally announce the Documentum 6 platform, advancing EMC's ability to lead the industry into the next generation of enterprise content management. In recognition of its ECM market presence, EMC was honored in the quarter with two marquis ECM industry awardsmagazine's Readers' Choice Award and the ACE Award. Last week EMC also announced that it has been positioned as a leader in the Forrester Wave: Business Process Management for Document Processes.

ECM Connection
VMware, an EMC subsidiary, grew sales 89% year-over-year to $298 million during the second quarter as it continued to unlock the value of virtualization for existing and new customers around the world. During the quarter, the virtualization leader broadened its product portfolio with new releases of its award-winning virtual desktop software and continued to expand its network of technology and distribution partners. VMware recently announced that Intel Corporation, through its global investment arm, Intel Capital, has agreed to become an investor. The partial initial public offering (IPO) of VMware is expected to be completed this summer.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (iv) risks associated with the VMware IPO, including the inability to manage successfully and complete the IPO, and risks associated with trading of VMware stock if the IPO is completed; (v) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vi) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (vii) component and product quality and availability; (viii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (ix) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (x) war or acts of terrorism; (xi) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiii) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2007," stock option expense, restricted stock expense and intangible amortization are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, where specified in the accompanying schedule entitled "Selected Non-GAAP Data For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2006," stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization, in-process research and development and restructuring credits are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed expenses (stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization, in-process research and development and restructuring credits) from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. For the second quarter of 2007, free cash flow equals $422 million and is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities (as defined by GAAP) of $622 million minus additions to property, plant and equipment of $154 million minus capitalized software development costs of $46 million. For the second quarter of 2006, free cash flow equals $189 million and is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities (as defined by GAAP) of $392 million minus
additions to property, plant and equipment of $156 million minus capitalized software development costs of $47 million. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock option expense, restricted stock expense, intangible amortization, in-process research and development and restructuring credits, do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation, intangible amortization and certain tax charges and benefits, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
Note: The presentation of the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 has been revised to adjust the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the initial adoption of FAS No. 123R. The effect of this change was to increase net income by $3.6 million and decrease additional paid-in-capital at January 1, 2006 by the same amount.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On August 2, 2007, EMC Corporation ("EMC" or the "Company") amended its internal guidelines to strengthen the stock ownership requirement for its executive officers. The amended stock ownership guidelines substantially increase the number of shares of EMC common stock that EMC executive officers are required to hold. Under the new guidelines, EMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be required to hold 500,000 unrestricted shares; EMC's Vice Chairman will be required to hold 200,000 unrestricted shares; EMC's Chief Financial Officer will be required to hold 150,000 unrestricted shares; and EMC's other executive officers will each be required to hold at least 100,000 unrestricted shares. The level of stock ownership required under the current guidelines is calculated as a multiple of an executive officer's base salary, and on average the amended guidelines will require EMC executives to hold nearly 50% more shares over the current stock ownership requirements. EMC executive officers will have three years to reach compliance with the new guidelines.
On August 10, 2007, EMC amended the Company's Insider Trading Policy to permit directors and executive officers to enter into pre-arranged stock trading plans in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
Certain directors and executive officers of EMC may adopt trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and EMC's policies regarding stock transactions, as part of each individual's long-term strategy to gradually diversify their investments in a disciplined way and to allow them to spread their stock trades over an extended period of time. Any transactions under the plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and/or Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not aware of material, non-public information to establish pre-arranged plans to sell company stock under specified conditions and times. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On August 24, 2007, Joe Tucci, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise a small portion of his EMC stock options, sell some of the acquired shares and retain some of the shares to satisfy the recent increase in EMC's stock ownership guidelines. Under the terms of the plan, established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and EMC's policies regarding stock transactions, Mr. Tucci may sell up to 440,000 shares during the remainder of the current quarter and may sell up to 400,000 shares during the fourth quarter of 2007. These shares will be acquired through the exercise of employee stock options granted in October 2002. If these sales are completed, they will represent approximately 8% of the total EMC shares and options owned by Mr. Tucci. In addition, if all options are exercised under the terms of the plan in the current quarter, Mr. Tucci will retain 60,000 of these shares, which will bring his stock ownership level above the 500,000 share minimum required under EMC's stock ownership guidelines.
Mr. Tucci last chose to exercise options and sell EMC shares in January 2004. Mr. Tucci adopted the plan as part of a long-term strategy to gradually diversify his investments in a disciplined manner and to satisfy EMC's amended stock ownership guidelines.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not aware of material, non-public information to establish pre-arranged plans to sell company stock under specified conditions and times.

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  Oct. 25, 2007  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced record third-quarter revenue and net income. EMC has now delivered seventeen consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth marked by strong, balanced execution across all its business lines and major geographies.
Total consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2007 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 17% over the $2.8 billion reported for the third quarter of 2006. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $492.9 million or $0.23 per diluted share, 77% higher than the GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.13 reported for the year-ago period. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2007 includes net gains of $115.2 million, primarily from the sale of six million shares of EMC's interest in VMware to Cisco Systems. Excluding this item, net income was $377.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share, an increase of 31% year-over-year. During the quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $718 million, an increase of 57% compared with the same period a year ago and free cash flow of $475 million, an increase of 124% year-over-year.
"Solid global execution of our strategy resulted in record third-quarter financial results," said Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Customers around the world are benefiting from the breadth and quality of our information infrastructure product and services portfolio, which provides them with the most cost-effective way to store, protect, optimize, and leverage their vast and growing quantities of strategic information. We see broad opportunities in the global marketplace, and we will continue to drive profitable growth by furthering technology integration across our portfolio, investing in research and development, and expanding into the fastest-growing global markets."
Tucci continued, "Among the many standouts during the quarter was VMware's quarterly performance and the completion of the initial public offering of approximately 10% of VMware. VMware is not only one of the fastest-growing businesses in the history of the software industry, but it has also created an entire IT category based on one of the very few game-changing technologies out there today. The IPO has enabled EMC to expose and unlock more of VMware's value for shareholders."
EMC systems revenue increased 9% year-over-year and represented 43% of total third-quarter revenue. Software license and maintenance revenue increased 25% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total third-quarter revenue. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew by 25% year-over-year and represented 16% of total third-quarter revenue.
Revenue from North America increased 15% compared with the same period a year ago and represented 59% of total third-quarter revenue. Revenue from operations outside of North America grew 21% year-over-year, highlighted by double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) regions.
"We demonstrated crisp business and financial execution around the world with operating income growing faster than revenue and free cash flow more than doubling compared to the same period a year ago," said David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We remain focused on driving operating leverage across the business. To continue to return value back to shareholders, we are also increasing our previously announced stock buyback commitment from $1 billion to $2 billion. Based on our results year-to-date and our expectations for a solid fourth quarter, we are now very clearly on track to exceed the annual financial targets we set in January."
Third-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, storage software and related customer and professional services, reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared with the year-ago period. Third-quarter growth in this business was largely driven by strong customer demand for EMC's industry-leading CLARiiON and Celerra networked storage systems and from EMC's expansive information protection portfolio, including the EMC Disk Library for back-up to disk, EMC Avamar for data de-duplication and EMC Recoverpoint for CDP. EMC Smarts resource management and EMC Rainfinity global file virtualization software experienced double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth. In the third quarter, EMC also announced its expansion of the industry's broadest set of storage technologies  spanning from entry-level to the high-end, helping customers of all sizes store information more cost-effectively, securely and intelligently.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business posted double-digit revenue growth, increasing third-quarter revenue 27% year-over-year to $189 million. New license revenue increased 34% on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, EMC announced the Documentum 6 platform, a key component of EMC's suite of enterprise content management products. With the release of Documentum 6, EMC continues to lead the industry into the next generation of enterprise content management, as it moves from a separate application platform to an integral part of an organization's information infrastructure.
RSA information security revenues for the third quarter of 2007 grew 22% when compared with the results of the division's constituent companies in the year-ago period, reaching $133 million in revenue. This growth was primarily driven by RSA's core authentication business, as well as its consumer-facing applications and information and event management offerings. The division also continued to see success in its comprehensive security solutions for businesses seeking to comply with regulatory mandates and managing information risk holistically across the enterprise.
VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW), which is the global leader in virtual infrastructure software for industry-standard systems and is majority-owned by EMC, had third-quarter revenues of $354 million, an increase of approximately 90% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, for certain time periods where noted, amounts relating to tax benefits, net gains on investments, including gain on sale of VMware stock, restructuring and IPR&D charges relating to EMC on a consolidated basis, and stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization relating to only EMC Information Infrastructure) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information
regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
Note: Prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify a portion of the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS123R in Q1'06 from the income statement to stockholders' equity. This reclassification results in an increase to net income in Q1'06 and YTD 2006 of $3,619 and a corresponding decrease in additional paid-in capital.

Free cash flow for VMware and EMC excludes the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances. Additionally, capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities which were reimbursed by EMC during 2006 and 2007 have been classified as VMware capital expenditures as incurred. Including the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances and excluding capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities as VMware expenditures as incurred, results in free cash flow for VMware of $76,844 for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, $38,281 for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, $130,103 for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, $109,744 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, $81,642 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, $49,424 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, $133,644 for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, $85,022 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and $339,146 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Including the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances and excluding capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities as VMware expenditures as incurred, results in free cash flow for EMC Information Infrastructure of $264,710 for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, $150,952 for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, $241,924 for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, $290,861 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, $504,595 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, $372,331 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, $341,445 for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, $743,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and $1,218,371 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

On October 31, 2007, Joe Tucci, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation ("EMC" or the "Corporation"), entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Rule 10b5-1") and EMC's policies regarding stock transactions. Under the terms of the plan, Mr. Tucci may sell up to 281,549 shares of EMC common stock during the remainder of the current quarter and may sell up to 889,316 shares during the first half of fiscal year 2008.

Under the terms of these plans, the officers may sell shares of EMC common stock during the first half of fiscal year 2008. Other directors and executive officers of the Corporation may enter into similar trading plans from time to time.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not aware of material, non-public information to establish pre-arranged plans to sell company stock under specified conditions and times. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time. Any sales executed on behalf of Mr. Tucci or the other directors or executive officers of the Corporation will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and/or Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 28, 2007, EMC Corporation ("EMC") entered into an employment arrangement with Joseph M. Tucci, its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the arrangement, Mr. Tucci will continue as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EMC until at least December 31, 2010.

At Mr. Tucci's request, he received no equity awards in 2007 so that the allocated equity awards, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") and consistent with its well-articulated compensation objectives, could be issued to certain other members of EMC's senior leadership team in recognition of the extraordinary job they performed in creating shareholder value (see Item 8.01 below). The Board of Directors will again review the appropriateness of an equity grant for Mr. Tucci in 2008, but no sooner than the third quarter.
Under the employment arrangement, if Mr. Tucci's employment is terminated, he will receive the following:

Goulden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and David A. Donatelli, Executive Vice President and President of EMC's Storage Division. Other executive officers have also entered or will soon be entering into amended change in control agreements (collectively, the "Amended CIC Agreements"). The Amended CIC Agreements will be effective as of December 31, 2007.
The Amended CIC Agreements provide benefits only if there is both a change in control and the executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, in each case, within twenty-four months following a change in control. The Amended CIC Agreements also incorporate the following material changes:
 
 
The foregoing description of the Amended CIC Agreements is qualified in all respects by reference to the form of Amended CIC Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated herein.

On November 28, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of equity awards to certain executive officers, including Messrs.

Goulden and Donatelli each received 80,000 non-qualified stock options and 160,000 restricted stock units. In furtherance of EMC's commitment to pay-for-performance, 60% of the total number of shares awarded to each individual is performance-based and will vest only if 2008 performance targets approved by the Board of Directors are met.
On November 28, 2007, the Compensation Committee also determined that effective January 1, 2008, no tax gross-ups will be provided to executive officers for any expenses such as personal use of company aircraft and executive physicals.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Mr. Joseph M. Tucci
[address]
Dear Joe:
This is to confirm our understanding regarding your continued role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation ("EMC"). As you know, the Board of Directors believes that your continuity of service as Chairman and CEO will benefit both the company and its shareholders. EMC is therefore pleased to agree to the following arrangement:
1. You will continue in the role of Chairman and CEO through at least December 31, 2010.
2. You will continue to work with the Board of Directors on the management succession development program that is currently underway.
3. Your annual cash compensation through 2010 will consist of a base salary of $1,000,000 and a target incentive bonus payment of $1,440,000.
4. At your request, you have received no equity awards in 2007. No sooner than the third quarter of 2008, the Board of Directors will review the desirability of an equity grant.
5. During the term of this arrangement, all of your health, welfare and other benefits will continue, according to applicable EMC policies.
6. Your Change in Control Agreement dated November 28, 2007 will remain in effect during the term of this arrangement and you will continue to receive any benefits as applicable under that agreement.
7. In the event your employment at EMC terminates prior to December 31, 2010 (not due to a Change in Control (as defined in your Change in Control Agreement)):
(a) If you leave voluntarily, you will receive no further base salary payments and will receive your target incentive bonus payment prorated for the period for which you have worked.
(b) If you are terminated by EMC without "cause" (as defined in your Change in Control Agreement), EMC will pay you base salary and target incentive bonus payments equivalent to one year's cash compensation described in Paragraph 3 above, to be paid out over the remaining term of this arrangement or over an eighteen month period, whichever is longer (the "Salary Continuation Period"). Consistent with the treatment of other senior executives, during the Salary Continuation Period, EMC will continue your benefits and any equity you hold as of the date of termination will continue to vest. If any of your equity grants would, by their terms, continue to
November 28, 2007
Page 2
 
vest for longer than the Salary Continuation Period, they will continue to vest according to the terms of the applicable plan and grant. To the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, payments will be delayed until the six-month anniversary of your termination of employment without "cause."
(c) If you are terminated by EMC for "cause", you will receive no further base salary payments and no further incentive bonus payments.
In the event of any termination of your employment under this Paragraph 7, you will receive no further severance payment other than as described above.
8. EMC and you agree that this arrangement will be governed by and construed in accordance with Massachusetts law.
9. All payments under this arrangement are subject to all applicable tax withholdings.
10. This arrangement will be binding on the Company's successors and assigns.
If this arrangement meets with your approval, please sign this letter below.
The Board and I look forward to your continued leadership over the next several years.
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
THIS AGREEMENT, dated [                    ], is made by and between EMC Corporation (the "Company"), and [                                ] (the "Executive") residing at [Address].
WHEREAS, the Company considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and
WHEREAS, the Executive has made and is expected to make, due to the Executive's intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company, its policies, methods, personnel, and problems, a significant contribution to the profitability, growth, and financial strength of the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company, as a publicly held corporation, recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control may exist, and that such possibility and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management may result in the departure or distraction of the Executive in the performance of the Executive's duties, to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of management personnel, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction and to ensure the continued availability to the Company of the Executive in the event of a Change in Control;
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other respective covenants and agreements of the parties herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
5.1 If the Executive fails to perform the Executive's full-time duties with the Company following a Change in Control as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness, during any period when the Executive so fails to perform the Company shall pay the Base Salary to the Executive, together with all compensation and benefits payable to the Executive under the terms of any compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than the Company's short- or long-term disability plan, as applicable, but including any bonus or incentive plan) maintained by the Company during such period, until the Executive resumes the full time performance of such duties or the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Disability.
5.2 If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for any reason following a Change in Control, the Company shall pay the Base Salary to the Executive through the Date of Termination, together with all compensation and benefits payable to the Executive through the Date of Termination under the terms of the Company's compensation and benefit plans, programs or arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason.
5.3 Except as expressly provided herein, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for any reason following a Change in Control, the Company shall pay to the Executive the Executive's normal post-termination compensation and benefits as such payments become due. Such post-termination compensation and benefits shall be determined under, and paid in accordance with, the Company's retirement, insurance and other compensation or benefit plans, programs and arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any equity plan or arrangement of the Company or any agreement between the Company and the Executive, upon
 
the occurrence of a Change in Control, any outstanding stock option, restricted stock or other equity or equity-based award granted to the Executive shall become immediately vested and exercisable if the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments described in Section 6.1. From and after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the "detrimental activity" provisions in the Company's equity plans shall no longer apply to any award issued to the Executive under such plans.
 
6.1 If the Executive's employment is terminated within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, other than (a) by the Company for Cause, (b) by reason of death or Disability, or (c) by the Executive without Good Reason, then the Company shall, subject to Section 15 hereof, pay the Executive the amounts, and provide the Executive the benefits, described in this Section 6.1 ("Severance Payments") and Section 6.2, in addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled under Section 5. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been terminated within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control and during the Term by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason, if (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause during a Potential Change in Control Period, or (ii) the Executive terminates Executive's employment for Good Reason during a Potential Change in Control Period. In the event that the Executive's employment is terminated in the manner described in the preceding sentence, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred immediately preceding such termination for purposes of Section 5.4 hereof. Except as described above or in Section 9.1, the Executive shall not be entitled to benefits pursuant to this Section 6.1 unless a Change in Control shall have occurred during the Term.
(A) The Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to 2.99 times the sum of (a) the Base Salary, and (b) the sum of the target annual bonus available to the Executive pursuant to each of the Company's annual bonus plans or any successor plans (but excluding any special performance or incentive plan) in which the Executive participates in respect of the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs (without giving effect to any event or circumstance constituting Good Reason), assuming for this purpose attainment of 100% of any applicable target; provided, however, that if the applicable target bonus would have been pro-rated for a partial fiscal year, such target bonus shall be recalculated for purposes of this Section 6.1(A) to equal the amount that for which the Executive would have been eligible for the entire fiscal year.
(B) For the thirty-six (36) month period immediately following the Date of Termination, the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive and Executive's dependents life, disability, accident and health insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and Executive's dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided to the Executive and Executive's dependents immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, at no greater after-tax cost to the Executive than the cost to the Executive immediately prior to such date or
 
occurrence. If, at the end of the thirty-six (36) month period following the Date of Termination, the Executive has not previously become eligible to receive comparable benefits from a new employer or pursuant to a government-sponsored health insurance or health care program, then the Company shall arrange, at its sole cost and expense, to enable the Executive to convert coverage for the Executive and the Executive's dependents being provided hereunder to individual policies or program, if applicable, upon the same terms as other former employees of the Company may apply for such conversion. The cost of providing the benefits set forth in this Section 6.1(B) shall be in addition to (and shall not reduce) the Severance Payments. Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6.1(B) shall be reduced to the extent the Executive becomes eligible to receive comparable benefits from a new employer or pursuant to a government-sponsored health insurance or health care program. Unless the Executive agrees to another method, the coverage described in this Section 6.1(B) will be provided through a third party insurer.
(C) The Company shall pay to the Executive a prorated portion of the Executive's bonus compensation for the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs (assuming that any applicable performance objectives were achieved at the target level of performance and without giving effect to any event or circumstance constituting Good Reason) calculated by multiplying (A) the target amount of such bonus compensation by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable fiscal year through the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365. The foregoing payment shall be reduced by the sum of any quarterly, semi-annual and other partial year bonus payments previously paid to the Executive in respect of the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs.
6.2 .
Gross Up
(A) Subject to Section 6.2(F), whether or not the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments, if any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) (all such payments and benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments.
(B) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such
 
payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. If there has not been a Date of Termination with respect to the Executive, the Company shall cause the Gross-Up Payment to be calculated within 30 days following the date upon which there occurs a change in ownership or control of the Company for purposes of section 280G of the Code.
(C) Upon the Executive's request, the Company shall promptly provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which calculations were made pursuant to this Section 6.2 including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).
(D) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of federal, state and local income and employment taxes), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined, provided that such additional payment shall only be made to the extent that the payment (or the right to the payment) does not result in taxation under section 409A of the Code, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(d) (in which case the payment shall be made in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the calculation of the Executive's excise tax liability under section 280G of the Code may be calculated). The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for
 
Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.
(E) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2, if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment with respect to a Change in Control occurring prior to December 31, 2009, but the Total Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount that could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of Total Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax (the "Reduced Amount"), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Total Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. If a reduction is required, the reduction shall be applied to the payments otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.1(A) hereof.
(F) If the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be reduced by the portion of the Gross-Up Payment that is attributable to equity awards granted to the Executive by the Company on and after August 10, 2007 ("Post 8/10/2007 Equity Awards"). The portion of the Gross-Up Payment that is attributable to Post 8/10/2007 Equity Awards shall be determined by multiplying the Gross-Up Payment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) attributable to the Executive's Post 8/10/2007 Equity Awards and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all of the Executive's "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a result of the application of this Section 6.1(E) the Reduced Amount (reduced by applicable taxes) exceeds the sum of the Total Payments and the Gross-Up Payment (such sum reduced by applicable taxes), then the Executive shall not receive a Gross-Up Payment and the Total Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. In such case, the reduction to the Total Payments shall be applied to the payments otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.1(A) hereof.
(G) The Executive will not be entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Agreement with respect to any change in ownership or control of the Company (for purposes of section 280G of the Code) occurring on or after December 31, 2009, but shall continue to remain entitled to a Gross-Up Payment with respect to any change in ownership or control of the Company (for purposes of section 280G of the Code) occurring prior to December 31, 2009 in accordance with this Section 6.2. In the event (1) the Executive's entitlement to a Gross-Up Payment is eliminated pursuant to this Section 6.2(G) and (2) the Reduced Amount (reduced by applicable taxes) exceeds the net amount of the Total Payments which would be retained by the Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax (and all other applicable taxes) on the Total Payments, the Total Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. If a reduction is required, the reduction shall be applied to the payments otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.1(A) hereof.
6.3 Subject to Section 14.3(A), the payments provided in subsection (A) and (C) of Section 6.1 and in Section 6.2 shall be made not later than the eighth day following the Release Deadline (or, in the case of Section 6.2, if there is no Date of Termination, then the fifth day following the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of Section
 
6.2), , , that if the amounts of such payments cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company or, in the case of payments under Section 6.2, in accordance with Section 6.2, of the minimum amount of such payments to which the Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the extent the Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Release Deadline (also subject to Section 14.3(A)). In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth (5th) business day after demand by the Company (together with interest at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). At the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).
provided
however
6.4 The Company shall pay to the Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination of the Executive's employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Such payments shall be made within five (5) business days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require. The Executive's reimbursement rights described in this Section 6.4 shall remain in effect for the life of the Executive, provided, that, in order for the Executive to be entitled to reimbursement hereunder, the Executive must submit the written reimbursement request described above within 180 days following the date upon which the applicable fee or expense is incurred.
 
7.1 . After a Change in Control, any purported termination of the Executive's employment (other than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 10. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail any facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called and held for the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of

Cause herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
7.2 . "Date of Termination," with respect to any purported termination of the Executive's employment after a Change in Control, shall mean (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of the Executive's duties during such thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination by the Company, shall not be less than ninety (90) days (except in the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the case of a termination by the Executive, shall not be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is given).
Date of Termination
7.3 . If within ten (10) days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined without regard to this Section 7.3), the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be extended until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Term ends or (ii) the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected); , , that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute given by the Executive only if such notice is given in good faith and the Executive pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.
Dispute Concerning Termination

however
7.4 . If the Date of Termination is extended in accordance with Section 7.3, the Company shall continue to pay the Executive the full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to, the Base Salary) and continue the Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which the Executive was participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the Date of Termination, as determined in accordance with Section 7.3. Amounts paid under this Section 7.4 are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement (other than those due under Section 5.2) and shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.
Compensation During Dispute
 
 
 
9.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the Company, the Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as the Executive would be entitled to hereunder if the Executive were to terminate the Executive's employment for Good Reason after a Change in Control and during the Term, except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.
9.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Executive) if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Executive's estate.
 
 
 
 
 
 
14.1 All claims by the Executive for benefits under this Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the Board and shall be in writing. Any denial by the Board of a claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered to the Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The Board shall afford a reasonable opportunity to the Executive for a review of the decision denying a claim and shall further allow the Executive to appeal to the Board a decision of the Board within sixty (60) days after notification by the Board that the Executive's claim has been denied.
14.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect; , , that the evidentiary standards set forth in this Agreement shall apply. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.

14.3 It is the intention of the Company and the Executive that this Agreement not result in taxation of the Executive under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and that the Agreement shall be construed in accordance with such intention. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

(D) If the provisions of Section 5.4 are applicable to an equity or equity-based award subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the immediate payment of the award contemplated by Section 5.4 would result in taxation under Section 409A, payment of such awards shall be made upon the earliest date upon which such payment may be made without resulting in taxation under Section 409A of the Code.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  Jan. 29, 2008  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced all-time record fourth-quarter and full-year revenue and strong year-over-year growth in profit, earnings per share and operating cash flow. EMC's 18 consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth was highlighted by balanced, double-digit revenue growth across the company's Information Storage, Content Management & Archiving, RSA Information Security, and VMware Virtual Infrastructure business lines and its four major geographies.
th
Total consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was a record $3.83 billion, an increase of 19% over the $3.21 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2006. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $525.7 million or $0.24 per diluted share, 33% higher than the GAAP $0.18 earnings per diluted share reported for the year-ago period. During the quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $979 million, an increase of 50% compared with the same period a year ago and free cash flow of $712 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year.
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2007 fiscal year was a record $13.23 billion, 19% higher than the $11.16 billion reported for the full 2006 fiscal year. GAAP net income for 2007 was $1.67 billion or $0.77 per diluted share, 43% higher than the GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.54 reported for 2006.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "2007 was truly a breakout year for EMC. We exceeded all of the aggressive financial targets we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year. The highly successful partial IPO of VMware clearly met its key goals. And we further organized around our One EMC' initiative to interlock and drive more technology and product integrations across our Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving, and RSA Information Security business units, making it much easier for our customers and partners to do business with EMC."
Commenting further, Tucci said, "Looking forward, EMC has never been better positioned to continue to grow and gain market share. We have the best product line-up in our history with a very favorable product cycle, and our proven go-to-market model is firmly in place. EMC is well positioned in the areas where IT spending will grow the fastest this year. Finally, our focus on innovation and R&D is enabling us to tackle emerging customer priorities such as Web 2.0, virtualization, compliance and new online methods for purchasing and consuming software."
During the fourth quarter, EMC systems revenue increased 15% compared with the same period a year ago and represented 44% of total fourth-quarter revenue. Software license and maintenance revenue increased 20% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total fourth-quarter revenue. Professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew by 27% year-over-year and represented 16% of total fourth-quarter revenue. Revenue from North America increased 16% compared with the same period a year ago and represented 55% of total fourth-quarter revenue. Revenue from operations outside of North America grew 23% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) and Latin America regions.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "We exceeded our growth, profitability and free cash flow targets for the fourth quarter and for the year. By investing in our go-to-market model and worldwide market presence, strengthening our product portfolio, and expanding our strategic partnerships around the world, we enter 2008 with an even stronger foundation for continued financial success and market share gains."
Fourth-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, storage software and related customer and professional services, reached $3.03 billion, an increase of 14% compared with the year-ago period. Growth in the Information Storage business reflects continued global demand for EMC Symmetrix, EMC CLARiiON, and EMC Celerra networked storage systems. Strong customer demand for IP storage solutions, next-generation backup and recovery capabilities, file-based virtualization, and model-based resource management also helped to drive strong year-over-year information storage revenue growth.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business posted double-digit revenue growth, increasing fourth-quarter revenue 17% year-over-year to $238 million. On a year-over-year basis, new license revenue increased 8% and maintenance and professional services revenue was up 25%. Growth in the Content Management and Archiving business reflects strong global demand for EMC's enterprise content management and archiving solutions to drive business efficiency, compliance and risk mitigation across the information infrastructure, and demand for EMC's Documentum 6 platform, which gives organizations of various sizes and across industries a robust, unified repository for managing, storing, securing, and delivering increasing amounts of unstructured content.
RSA Information Security revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 grew 30% year-over-year, reaching $148 million. This growth was primarily driven by RSA's key management and its consumer-facing applications, as well as its compliance and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. During the quarter, the division continued to see success with its holistic, information-centric approach to information security and risk management and its unparalleled breadth of solutions that address customers' key areas of information security and its management across the information infrastructure.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, had fourth-quarter revenues of $412 million, an increase of approximately 80% compared to the year-ago quarter. VMware is the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the datacenter. More than 100,000 customers rely on VMware to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business continuity, strengthen security and go green. VMware is based in Palo Alto, California.

Software license and maintenance revenue grew 25% to $5.33 billion, and professional services, systems maintenance and other services revenue grew 23% in 2007 to $2.13 billion. For the year, systems revenue represented 44% of EMC's annual revenue, software license and maintenance represented 40% and professional services and systems maintenance represented 16% of annual revenue.
EMC's Information Infrastructure business revenues, which comprise EMC's Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security business revenues, were $11.9 billion and grew 14% in 2007. EMC's Information Storage business annual revenue increased 10% in 2007 to $10.61 billion compared to 2006. Annual revenue for EMC's Content Management and Archiving business grew 13% year-over-year to $773 million and, on a comparable basis, annual revenue for the RSA Information Security division grew 24% to $525 million.
Total consolidated revenue for EMC's full 2007 fiscal year, which includes EMC's Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure businesses, was a record $13.23 billion, 19% higher than the $11.16 billion reported for the full 2006 fiscal year.
For the year, revenue from EMC's North America geography increased 17% compared with 2006 and represented 57% of total annual revenue. Revenue from operations outside of North America grew 22% year-over-year. All four of EMC's major geographies posted double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, including EMC's Asia Pacific and Japan geography which emerged as the company's fastest-growing geography for 2007.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, for certain time periods where noted, amounts relating to tax benefits, net gains on investments, including gain on sale of VMware stock, restructuring and IPR&D charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
Note: Prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify a portion of the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS123R in Q1'06 from the income statement to stockholders' equity. This reclassification results in an increase to net income in Q1'06 and YTD 2006 of $3,619 and a corresponding decrease in additional paid-in capital.

Free cash flow for VMware and EMC excludes the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances. Additionally, capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities which were reimbursed by EMC during 2006 and 2007 have been classified as VMware capital expenditures as incurred. Including the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances and excluding capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities as VMware expenditures as incurred results in free cash flow for VMware of $109,744 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, $103,596 for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, $194,766 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $368,306 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Including the change in the intercompany due to/due from balances and excluding capital expenditures for VMware's headquarters facilities as VMware expenditures as incurred results in free cash flow for EMC Information Infrastructure of $290,861 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, $608,840 for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, $1,034,668 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $1,827,211 for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
As previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2007, on May 3, 2007, the shareholders of EMC Corporation ("EMC") approved a company proposal to exempt EMC from the requirements of the provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act which provide that the terms of directors of a public corporation incorporated in Massachusetts, such as EMC, shall be staggered. Beginning with EMC's 2008 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors will be elected for one-year terms.
On January 31, 2008, the Board of Directors of EMC approved amendments, effective as of the opening of the polls at the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders, to EMC's Bylaws regarding vacancies on the Board and the advance notice provisions for nominating directors to conform to the declassified structure of the Board.
The Amended and Restated Bylaws of EMC are filed herewith as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

No director resigning, and (except where a right to receive compensation shall be expressly provided in a duly authorized written agreement with the corporation) no director removed, shall have the right to any compensation as such director for any period following such director's removal, or any right to damages on account of such removal, whether such director's compensation be by the month or by the year or otherwise, unless in the case of a resignation, the directors, or in case of a removal, the shareholders, shall in their discretion provide for compensation.
Resignation and Removal

disinterested directors then in office, provided that there has been obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal counsel to the effect that such director or officer appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such individual's action was in the best interests of the corporation; or (c) by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock at the time entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, exclusive of any stock owned by any interested director or officer. Expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by any director or officer in connection with the defense or disposition of any such action, suit or other proceeding may be paid from time to time by the corporation in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by such director or officer to repay to the corporation the amounts so paid by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that indemnification for such expenses is not authorized under this Section 7. The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled. As used in this Section, the terms, "director" and "officer" include their respective heirs, executors and administrators, and an "interested" director or officer is one against whom in such capacity the proceedings in question or another proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then pending. Nothing contained in this Section shall affect any rights to indemnification to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law.
The seal of the corporation shall, subject to alteration by the directors, consist of a flat-faced circular die with the word "Massachusetts", together with the name of the corporation and the year of its organization, cut or engraved thereon.
Except as the directors may generally or in particular cases authorize the execution thereof in some other manner, all deeds, leases, transfers, contracts, bonds, notes, checks, drafts and other obligations made, accepted or endorsed by the corporation shall be signed by the president or by one of the vice presidents or by the treasurer.
The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on December 31.
These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose, of which the notice shall specify the subject matter of the proposed alteration, amendment or repeal or the sections to be affected thereby, by vote of the shareholders. These bylaws may also be altered,
 
amended or repealed by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, except that the directors shall not take any action which provides for indemnification of directors nor any action to amend this Section 11, and except that the directors shall not take any action unless permitted by law.
Any bylaw so altered, amended or repealed by the directors may be further altered or amended or reinstated by the shareholders in the above manner.
The provisions of Chapter 110D shall not apply to control share acquisitions of the corporation.
If the provisions of Chapter 110D shall become applicable to control share acquisitions of the corporation through amendment of these bylaws or otherwise, the following provisions shall apply:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
References in this Section to Chapter 110D mean Chapter 110D of the Massachusetts General Laws as in effect from time to time.
 
The provisions of Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws shall not apply to "business combinations" (as defined therein) involving the corporation.

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 23, 2008  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced all-time record first-quarter revenue and its 19
th
consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. EMC's total consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2008 was $3.47 billion, an increase of 17% over the $2.98 billion reported for the first quarter of 2007.
First-quarter GAAP net income was $268.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, which included a $79.2 million non-cash charge for in-process research and development (IPR&D) resulting from acquisitions completed during the quarter. Excluding this charge, net income was $348.0 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Non-GAAP first-quarter net income, which excludes the IPR&D charge and other items, was $477.3 million or $0.23 per diluted share, 28% higher than the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.18 for the year-ago period.
During the quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $918.3 million, an increase of 14% compared with the same period a year ago, and free cash flow of $717.5 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC is off to a solid start to the year, and we remain on track to achieve the 2008 financial targets we set for the business at the beginning of the year. We entered the year with the strongest and most diversified product, solutions and services portfolio in our history. From the consumer to the small- and medium-sized business and up through the enterprise, we are delivering to the market high-quality, innovative IT solutions faster than ever before. These offerings remain squarely aligned with top CIO spending priorities and are optimized to help businesses manage their information and drive IT efficiency throughout their organizations."
"Looking ahead, EMC's growth opportunities are many as we continue to aggressively strengthen our core business, grow into new and adjacent markets and expand our presence around the globe," Tucci added. "The power of our technology portfolio positions us well to extend our leadership and continue gaining share."
Compared with the first quarter of 2007, EMC systems revenue increased 10% and represented 41% of total first-quarter revenue. Software license and maintenance revenue increased 18% and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Other services revenue grew 30% and represented 18% of total revenue.
 
From a geographic perspective, revenue from North America increased 14% compared with the same period a year ago and represented 57% of total first-quarter revenue. Revenue from operations outside of North America grew 21% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in each of EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) and Latin America regions.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "EMC demonstrated strong revenue growth and operating performance. Our focus on investing in and delivering the right solutions to the right markets continues as the driving force behind our successful and diversified business model. This focus will serve EMC, our customers and shareholders well as we not only sustain but extend our market and technology leadership."
In the first quarter, EMC continued to return value to shareholders by leveraging its strong cash position, spending approximately $557.2 million to repurchase approximately 36 million shares of EMC. This completed the company's $2 billion share repurchase plan it embarked upon in January 2007. In addition, EMC recently increased its share repurchase authorization by 250 million shares.
First-Quarter Highlights
Revenue from EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, storage software and related customer and professional services, reached $2.71 billion, an increase of 12% compared with the year-ago period. Growth in the Information Storage business was driven by strong demand for EMC's storage products and professional services portfolio across all major geographies. EMC Symmetrix revenue increased 8%, EMC CLARiiON revenue increased 19% and EMC Celerra network-attached storage revenue increased more than 50%, each compared with the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, EMC continued to expand its storage portfolio with new products and capabilities that provide customers with ease-of-use, proven reliability and information storage innovation. For example, EMC became the first enterprise storage vendor to integrate flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) into its core product portfolio, enabling Symmetrix DMX-4 customers to achieve unprecedented performance and energy efficiency.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business increased first-quarter revenue 8% year-over-year to $185.2 million. Organizations around the world continued to choose EMC's enterprise content management and archiving solutions to effectively manage their growing volumes of unstructured data, while improving business efficiencies, increasing productivity, and meeting compliance and risk mitigation requirements. Also during the first quarter, EMC's Content Management and Archiving business captured several honors, including an ACE award from at the AIIM International Conference.
ECM Connection
For the first quarter of 2008, revenue from RSA, The Security Division of EMC, grew 13% year-over-year, reaching $134.9 million. This growth was driven primarily by global demand for the division's risk-based authentication solutions, anti-fraud services, and security information and event management solutions. Companies across industries and around the world continued to choose the powerful portfolio of RSA security products and services to address their
critical requirements around data security, security information management and data loss prevention, and to drive business acceleration and innovation across their organizations.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, had first-quarter revenues of $438.2 million, an increase of approximately 71% compared to the year-ago quarter. VMware is the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the datacenter. Customers of all sizes rely on VMware to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business continuity, strengthen security and be more energy efficient. With 2007 revenues of $1.32 billion, more than 100,000 customers, and nearly 14,000 partners, VMware is one of the fastest growing public software companies.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial
measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to tax benefits, in-process research and development charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cash flows from operations, capital expenditures and free cash flow for VMware within EMC and EMC Information Infrastructure have been adjusted to exclude the impact of purchases of equipment by VMware from EMC which have been recorded as capital expenditures by VMware on a stand-alone basis but are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, cash flow from operations, capital expenditures and free cash flow for VMware within EMC and EMC Information Infrastructure have been adjusted for VMware's capital expenditures for its headquarters facilities which were reimbursed by EMC during Q1 2007. Also, cash flows from operations and free cash flow for VMware within EMC have been adjusted for shares repurchased for tax withholdings on the vesting of restricted stock which have been recorded by VMware on a stand-alone basis as a financing activity but as an operating activity in consolidation. Had these items not been adjusted, cash flows from operations, capital expenditures and free cash flow for VMware within EMC would have been $133,180, $49,022 and $79,994, for Q1 2008 and $104,902, $16,584 and $81,646 for Q1 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 23, 2008  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced record second-quarter revenue results and its 20
th
consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. The company achieved balanced execution with double-digit revenue growth in systems, software and services and across all of its major business segments and geographies. EMC's total consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2008 was $3.67 billion, an increase of 18% over the $3.12 billion reported for the second quarter of 2007.
Second-quarter GAAP net income was $377.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Non-GAAP second-quarter net income, which excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization, was $511.7 million or $0.24 per diluted share, 20% higher than the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.20 for the year-ago period.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC demonstrated solid second-quarter performance. I'm proud that we've achieved 20 consecutive quarters, or half a decade, of consecutive double-digit revenue growth. Very few companies, particularly of our size, can make that claim. Our focus on information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure is paying off and is the driving force behind our strong financial position, our successful business model and our competitive advantage."
Tucci added, "Despite continued economic uncertainty at the macro level, we believe spending on information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure technologies and solutions will continue to grow, driven largely by the need to manage the ever-expanding volume of information efficiently, securely and cost effectively. The challenge of dealing with this information overload is leading to a set of needs that EMC  our people, technology, services, and partners  is uniquely able to address."
From a geographic perspective, revenue from the United States increased 10% compared with the same period a year ago. Revenue from operations outside of the United States grew 27% year over year and represented a record 48% of total second-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) region increased 27%, Asia-Pacific & Japan (APJ) revenue increased 27%, and Latin America revenue increased 24%, each compared with the year-ago quarter.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "I am pleased with EMC's execution and solid performance in the second quarter. We achieved strong top-line and bottom-line growth and ended the quarter with a record $8.1 billion in cash and investments. As one of the most trusted technology partners in IT, we believe we are well positioned strategically and operationally for ongoing success."
Second-Quarter Highlights
Revenue from EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, storage software and related customer and professional services, reached $2.87 billion, an increase of 14% compared with the year-ago period. Growth in the Information Storage business reflects continued worldwide demand for EMC's networked storage solutions, with particularly strong traction from faster-growing international regions, EMC's mid-range storage systems connected to IP networks, and the company's professional consulting and implementation services. In the high-end of the market, second-quarter revenue from EMC Symmetrix networked storage products increased 10% year over year, driven by continued customer demand for large-scale enterprise consolidation and improved energy efficiency. In the mid-range, EMC Celerra network-attached storage products continued to experience strong revenue growth, increasing more than 50% year over year. Also during the quarter, the business benefited from innovative technologies and features introduced this year, including new solid state drives that use flash memory, virtual provisioning for simplified storage provisioning and increased system utilization, and data de-duplication for improved backup efficiency.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business increased second-quarter revenue 18% year over year to $204 million. Growth in the business was led by customer demand for EMC's solutions for effective transactional content management that advance collaboration, compliance and risk-management initiatives, as well as improve business processes and increase productivity. This week, EMC announced the Documentum 6.5 platform, offering customers even more advanced enterprise content management (ECM) capabilities that blend the ease of use of Web 2.0 applications while minimizing the associated risk. With Documentum 6.5, organizations can leverage newer technologies, such as Web 2.0, improve the existing content applications already in use, and power all of these with a more scalable and secure ECM platform than ever before available.
For the second quarter of 2008, revenue from RSA, The Security Division of EMC, grew 15% year over year, reaching $144 million and benefiting from strength in areas such as data loss prevention (DLP), identity protection & verification, and security information & event management. During the quarter, the division made available key advancements to its DLP suite through important new capabilities and launched a comprehensive Identity Assurance solution that enables trusted identities to freely and securely interact with systems and access information. These additions support EMC's Information Risk Management strategy, which allows customers to effectively recognize, assess and mitigate the risk to their information at any point in its lifecycle. Organizations continue to choose RSA's comprehensive portfolio of security products and services to meet key compliance requirements around data security, security information management and data loss prevention more efficiently and holistically.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, contributed second-quarter revenues of $453 million, an increase of 52% compared to the year-ago quarter. VMware is the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the datacenter. Customers of all sizes rely on VMware to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business continuity, strengthen security and be more energy efficient. Visit for more information about the virtualization software leader's second-quarter financial results.

"EMC has amassed the broadest, most innovative and most integrated product portfolio in company history. The rapid pace at which we're able to deliver new technologies and features to market makes EMC's portfolio even more compelling," continued Goulden. "Customers need help keeping up with information as it continues to grow at nearly 60% per year. EMC's unique ability to help solve all their information management challenges is a powerful competitive advantage."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the directors may at any time issue all or from time to time any part of the unissued capital stock of the corporation from time to time authorized under the articles of organization and may determine, subject to any requirements of law, the consideration for which stock is to be issued and the manner of allocating such consideration between capital and surplus.
Powers

No director resigning, and (except where a right to receive compensation shall be expressly provided in a duly authorized written agreement with the corporation) no director removed, shall have the right to any compensation as such director for any period following such director's removal, or any right to damages on account of such removal, whether such director's compensation be by the month or by the year or otherwise, unless in the case of a resignation, the directors, or in case of a removal, the shareholders, shall in their discretion provide for compensation.
Resignation and Removal

disposition of any such action, suit or other proceeding may be paid from time to time by the corporation in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by such director or officer to repay to the corporation the amounts so paid by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that indemnification for such expenses is not authorized under this Section 7. The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled. As used in this Section, the terms, "director" and "officer" include their respective heirs, executors and administrators, and an "interested" director or officer is one against whom in such capacity the proceedings in question or another proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then pending. Nothing contained in this Section shall affect any rights to indemnification to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law.
The seal of the corporation shall, subject to alteration by the directors, consist of a flat-faced circular die with the word "Massachusetts", together with the name of the corporation and the year of its organization, cut or engraved thereon.

The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on December 31.
These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose, of which the notice shall specify the subject matter of the proposed alteration, amendment or repeal or the sections to be affected thereby, by vote of the shareholders. These bylaws may also be altered, amended or repealed by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, except that the directors shall not take any action which provides for indemnification of directors nor any action to amend this Section 11, and except that the directors shall not take any action unless permitted by law.
Any bylaw so altered, amended or repealed by the directors may be further altered or amended or reinstated by the shareholders in the above manner.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.  Oct. 22, 2008  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced record third-quarter revenue and its 21
st
consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. EMC's total consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2008 was $3.7 billion, an increase of 13% over the $3.3 billion reported for the third quarter of 2007.
Third-quarter GAAP net income was $411 million or $0.20 per diluted share, which includes a $0.01 special income tax benefit. Third-quarter non-GAAP net income was $528 million or $0.25 per diluted share, 14% higher than the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.22 for the year-ago period.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Against the backdrop of a tough global economy, EMC delivered its 21
st
consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and solid double-digit profit growth. These results reflect the high quality and leadership of EMC's broad portfolio of storage, information management and security products and services and the global reach of our direct sales force and trusted partners. Customers will continue to turn to EMC as they focus their efforts on cost savings and maximizing efficiency across their information infrastructure. Even with a challenging economic environment ahead, we remain confident and well positioned to compete effectively, continue winning business and outpace our peers in the marketplace."
Consolidated revenue from the United States increased 7% compared with the same period a year ago. Revenue from operations outside of the United States grew 19% year over year and represented 46% of total third-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) region increased 20%, Asia-Pacific & Japan (APJ) revenue increased 19%, and Latin America revenue increased 27%, each compared with the year-ago quarter.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "EMC is well positioned with the financial flexibility of a strong cash position and cash flow, along with an expanding market opportunity driven by the continued growth of business and personal information. As customers deal with this information growth, while also reducing costs and improving IT efficiencies, we are confident that EMC has the best portfolio of products and services to help them succeed. We remain laser-focused on managing our cost structure, increasing customer loyalty, maximizing shareholder value and strengthening our competitive advantage to gain market share."
Third-Quarter Highlights
Revenue from EMC's Information Storage business, which includes revenue from storage systems, storage management software and related customer and professional services, reached $2.9 billion, an increase of 11% compared with the year-ago period. This growth was largely driven by strong customer demand for EMC's industry-leading networked storage solutions across a broad customer base, with double-digit year-over-year revenue growth from EMC's midrange and entry-level information storage platforms that connect to both IP and Fibre channel networks. During the quarter, EMC's Information Storage business also benefited from double-digit year-over-year revenue growth from its broad portfolio of industry-leading backup, recovery and archive software that helps customers meet new information protection and recovery requirements, control explosive data growth and improve cost savings in the data center.
For the third quarter of 2008, revenue from RSA, The Security Division of EMC, grew 11% year over year, reaching $147 million. The third-quarter growth in the RSA business was led by customer demand for its security information and event management solutions and its identity protection and verification solutions. Growth in the business reflects the completeness of EMC's information-centric security strategy and its leading portfolio of solutions that are uniquely suited to help customers address the overall process of securing data, managing risk, and meeting multiple compliance demands in a holistic, repeatable and cost-efficient manner.
EMC's Content Management and Archiving business' third-quarter revenue was $188 million. During the quarter, the business benefited from continued demand for EMC's next-generation enterprise content management solutions for effective transactional content management, dynamic customer communication management and content management for the Web 2.0 enterprise  fostering dynamic new ways people work, network and collaborate, while advancing requirements for security, performance and compliance.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, contributed third-quarter revenues of $472 million, an increase of 33% compared to the year-ago quarter. VMware is the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the data center. Customers of all sizes rely on VMware to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business continuity, strengthen security and be more energy efficient.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) the impact of any expense reduction initiatives; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined
differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization, special income tax benefits, restructuring charges and net gains on investments) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

To improve the competitiveness and efficiency of its global business in response to a challenging global economy, on December 31, 2008, the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of EMC approved a plan to streamline EMC's Information Infrastructure business's cost structure. The plan includes the following components:
 
 
 
The total charge resulting from this plan is expected to be between $335 million and $360 million, with $220 million recognized in 2008, $100 million to $125 million to be recognized in 2009 and 2010 and the remainder to be recognized through 2015. Total cash expenditures associated with the plan are expected to be in the range of $311 million to $336 million.
EMC's press release describing the plan and charges is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The information in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
EMC management also determined that certain assets were impaired because the forecasted cash flows from the assets are expected to be less than the assets' net book value. The impairment charge totals approximately $28 million and is comprised of approximately $21 million of capitalized technology costs and approximately $7 million of strategic investments. This charge will not result in any future cash expenditures.
EMC's press release describing the impairments is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
HOPKINTON, Mass.  January 7, 2009  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced that it expects fourth-quarter 2008 revenues of approximately $4 billion, representing an EMC record for quarterly revenue, approximately 8% revenue growth compared with the third quarter of 2008, and 4% growth over the same period a year ago. EMC also announced that it expects in the fourth quarter:
 
 
 
These preliminary revenue and EPS results, excluding the effect of the charge, are in line with estimates the company provided on October 22, 2008.
"We are very pleased with our preliminary Q4 financial results," said Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and CEO. "We were able to generate all-time record revenue and strong sequential revenue growth against the backdrop of a challenging global economy. Customers are telling us that information infrastructure and virtualization products and solutions are at or very near the top of their IT spending priorities. This, coupled with the technological advantage and quality of EMC's solutions and the strength of our sales and service organizations, helped us achieve our Q4 financial goals."
To improve the competitiveness and efficiency of its global business, EMC also announced a restructuring program to further streamline the costs related to its Information Infrastructure business, which does not include VMware. EMC expects the program to reduce costs from its 2008 annualized rate by approximately $350 million in 2009, increasing to approximately $500 million in 2010. The program's focus is to consolidate back office functions, field and campus offices; rebalance investments towards higher-growth products and markets; reduce management layers; and further reduce indirect spend on contractors, third-party services and travel. The restructuring program will reduce EMC's global Information Infrastructure workforce by approximately 2,400 positions, or about 7% of its headcount as of September 30, 2008.
"We managed our costs and investments very carefully throughout 2008," Tucci continued. "However, we believe this additional program will help us strike the right balance between achieving higher levels of efficiency and sustaining strong business agility and performance, without in any way compromising our ability to serve the needs of our customers over the long-term. We are very confident in the competitiveness of our products, services and solutions and the skill and determination of our workforce. Our goal is to position EMC for continued success throughout the downturn and for even greater success during the next economic growth cycle."
As a result of the program, EMC will book a pre-tax restructuring charge of $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. After taxes, this charge is $200 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. EMC expects to record additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $100 million to $125 million across 2009 and 2010.
The program's expected savings will come from both cost reductions and the transformation of several areas of EMC's operational cost structure. As part of the program, EMC is undertaking several initiatives to transform the structural efficiency of how it operates worldwide. These initiatives will include the consolidation and movement of various facilities and processes beginning in 2009 and to be completed by the end of 2010. As part of these transformation efforts, the company expects to incur additional non-recurring, pre-tax transition costs of approximately $75 million to $100 million over this period; these investments are necessary to ramp up the new, more efficient capabilities ahead of switching over from the existing cost structure. EMC will break out these transition expenses in its financial results as they are incurred during the phase-in period.
Further details will be provided during EMC's fourth quarter earnings call scheduled for January 27, 2009.
A restructuring charge of $0.10 per diluted share, stock-based compensation of $0.05 per diluted share and intangible asset amortization of $0.02 per diluted share are excluded from the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.31.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the
growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) the impact of any expense reduction initiatives; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
This release also contains estimates of our preliminary fourth-quarter financial information. We are continuing to review our financial and operating results, and actual results may differ materially from those contained herein. In particular, the preliminary fourth-quarter financial information could vary from the above estimates based on the final accounting.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the release, certain items noted (including, where noted, amounts relating to restructuring charges, stock-based compensation and intangible asset amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  Jan. 27, 2009  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported fourth-quarter 2008 revenue of $4.02 billion, an increase of 8% sequentially and 5% year over year, representing an all-time EMC record for quarterly revenue.
Fourth-quarter GAAP net income was $288.0 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which includes a $0.10 restructuring charge. Fourth-quarter non-GAAP net income was $646.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share, 7% higher compared with the year-ago period.
For 2008, EMC posted total consolidated revenue of a record $14.88 billion, an increase of 12% year over year and representing EMC's sixth consecutive year of double-digit annual revenue growth. GAAP net income for 2008 was $1.35 billion or $0.64 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income
1
for the full year was $2.16 billion or $1.04 per diluted share, an increase of 14% year over year.
During the fourth quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and free cash flow of $775 million, each increasing 9% year over year. For the year, EMC's operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, an increase of 14% compared with 2007, and free cash flow was $2.6 billion, an increase of 17% year over year.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC's ability to achieve record financial results despite the macro-economy was driven by tight alignment with key customer priorities; the strongest and most integrated product, services and partner portfolio in company history; and solid execution throughout the year. We've entered 2009 with a robust and diversified business model, which we intend to leverage to extend our technology lead and gain market share."
Tucci added, "EMC has a firm grasp on what's required to thrive in tough times and emerge even stronger in the next growth cycle. We remain intensely focused on customers' top priorities  saving money, attaining a faster ROI, reducing risk and preparing for the delivery of next-generation data centers. Finally, we remain committed to investing heavily in research and development to extend our technology lead and maintain rapid product rollout cycles."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Financial strength and flexibility are high on the list of EMC's most strategic advantages. Throughout 2008 we managed our spending carefully, while reinvesting in future growth opportunities, strengthening the competitiveness of our solutions and extending our market leadership. Through 2009 we will continue to streamline operations, reduce costs and strengthen the efficiencies of our global operations."
EMC's best estimate is that 2009 global IT spending will decline as a percentage in the mid to high single digits compared with 2008. The company expects the markets that it addresses will perform slightly better than the overall IT market. The company also expects that a higher than usual percentage of the full-year IT spending will take place in the second half of the year.
Fourth-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Infrastructure business revenue for the fourth quarter  comprising Information Storage, RSA Security, and Content Management & Archiving  was $3.5 billion, an increase of 8% sequentially and up 2% compared with the year-ago period. This growth reflects the completeness of EMC's broad portfolio of products and services uniquely suited to help customers address the growth and management of information and drive cost savings across their IT environments.
Fourth-quarter Information Infrastructure business highlights included strong customer demand for EMC's:
 
 
 
 
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, contributed fourth-quarter revenue of $514 million.
EMC consolidated fourth-quarter revenue from the United States increased 6% compared with the same period a year ago. Fourth-quarter revenue from EMC's operations outside of the United States grew 4% year over year and represented 46% of total fourth-quarter revenue.
2008 Highlights
Full-year 2008 consolidated revenue was $14.88 billion, 12% higher than the year-ago period. EMC's Information Infrastructure business grew revenue 9% to $13.0 billion, driven by the introduction of new, industry-leading products, the quality and breadth of EMC's global services portfolio, technology integrations and product enhancements from across all business units, strengthening the company's market leadership and competitiveness.
In addition, VMware contributed revenue of $1.88 billion.
Full-year 2008 consolidated revenue from EMC's operations outside of the United States grew 17% year over year and represented 46% of total annual revenue, with the Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific & Japan (APJ) and Latin America regions posting double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks
associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) the impact of any expense reduction initiatives; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this release regarding market conditions are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this release after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization, special income tax benefits, restructuring charges, IPR&D charges and net gains on investments) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 23, 2009  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported first-quarter 2009 revenue of $3.15 billion, reflecting solid revenue results in a challenging global economic environment. Through its continued emphasis on operational efficiency, in the first quarter EMC generated operating cash flow of $864 million and free cash flow of $681 million, all contributing to record cash and investments of $9.8 billion.
First-quarter consolidated revenue of $3.15 billion declined 9.2% compared with the year-ago period, or 5.7%, adjusting for the impact from currency. First-quarter 2009 GAAP net income attributable to EMC was $194.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $251.6 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008. First-quarter 2009 non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC was $323.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared with $460.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008.

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Within a very tough economy, EMC executed soundly in the first quarter, leveraging the unique power of our highly complementary information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure strategies. As we look to the balance of 2009, we believe the global IT spending environment has reached  or is very near  the bottom. We expect IT spending to improve in the second half of 2009 as customers will have better budget visibility, be further through their own restructuring programs and broader stimulus packages should be underway."
Tucci continued, "Looking ahead, EMC will advance our place among our customers' most strategic IT providers as they take advantage of trends shaping the future of IT such as the virtual data center and cloud computing. As a technology-driven company, we will continue to
use our financial strength to remain aggressive with R&D, extend our technology leadership, forge even tighter and deeper strategic alliances and deliver customers even more advanced solutions and services for their most strategic IT initiatives."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "EMC's first-quarter results reflect the resiliency of our business in a very challenging global economy. We executed well on our cost reduction plans during the quarter and maintained disciplined expense control, which resulted in decent profitability and excellent free cash flow, while continuing investments to further enhance our product and services offerings and expand our customer reach."
Goulden continued, "We are taking additional near-term cost reduction actions that will save EMC an additional $100 million in 2009. We now expect to reduce EMC's 2009 Information Infrastructure costs by approximately $450 million from our 2008 spend, increasing to approximately $500 million in 2010. We believe these near- and longer-term actions to improve our effectiveness and efficiency will help EMC ride out this period of economic uncertainty and put us in a position of even greater strength when conditions improve."
EMC's best estimate is that 2009 global IT spending will decline as a percentage in the very-high-single-digit to very-low-double-digit range compared with 2008. EMC also expects second-quarter 2009 global IT spending will probably be flat compared with the first quarter of 2009, and the second half of 2009 will be stronger than the first half of the year.
First-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Infrastructure business revenue for the first quarter  comprising Information Storage, RSA Security, and Content Management & Archiving  was $2.7 billion. During the quarter, the business benefited from new, industry-leading products, the quality and breadth of EMC's global services portfolio, technology integrations and product enhancements from across EMC's information infrastructure portfolio. First-quarter Information Infrastructure business highlights included customer demand for EMC's:
 
 
 
 
 
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, contributed first-quarter revenue of $470.4 million, an increase of 7.4% compared with the year-ago quarter.
EMC consolidated first-quarter revenue from the United States was $1.64 billion and represented 52% of total first-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's operations outside of the United States was $1.51 billion and represented 48% of total first-quarter revenue.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) litigation that we may be involved in; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this release regarding market conditions are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this release after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and IPR&D charges) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
The following costs are included in EMC Consolidated Non-GAAP and EMC Information Infrastructure Non-GAAP results
 
 
Note: schedule may not add due to rounding

Date: June 1, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  June 1, 2009  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today proposed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Data Domain, Inc. (NASDAQ: DDUP) for $30.00 per share in cash, in a transaction with a total enterprise value of approximately $1.8 billion, net of Data Domain's cash. EMC's all-cash offer represents a 20% premium to the cash and stock offer made by NetApp for Data Domain on May 20, 2009.
EMC's all-cash proposal is superior to the proposed NetApp transaction providing Data Domain stockholders greater value and certainty. EMC's proposal is not subject to a financing or due diligence contingency, and the company will use existing cash balances to finance the transaction. EMC is promptly commencing a tender offer for all outstanding Data Domain common stock in order to expedite the timing of this transaction. The proposal was unanimously approved by the EMC Board of Directors.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Strategically, this combination will further enhance our ability to broaden EMC's best-in-class storage portfolio for the benefit of EMC and Data Domain customers and this, in turn, will accelerate EMC's top- and bottom-line growth rates. Our substantially superior proposal is a win-win for both companies.
Tucci added, "The combination of EMC and Data Domain technologies will strengthen EMC's leadership in the fast-growing and very important next-generation disk-based backup and archive market, and will also result in a business larger than a billion dollars for EMC in 2010. We expect the transaction with Data Domain to be accretive to EMC's 2010 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share."
EMC has made this offer to acquire Data Domain for its fast-growing revenue base, its strong data protection-focused management team and sales force and its highly complementary storage software technology that will help to accelerate both companies' ability to deliver industry-leading next-generation disk-based backup and archiving solutions for customers.
 
EMC has retained both external financial and legal advisors to assist it with this transaction.

The full text of the letter that EMC sent to Data Domain's President and Chief Executive Officer follows below:
Mr. Frank Slootman
President and Chief Executive Officer
Data Domain, Inc.
2421 Mission College Boulevard
Santa Clara, California 95054
Dear Frank:
On behalf of EMC, I am pleased to submit to you and your Board of Directors a proposal to acquire Data Domain which is substantially superior to the NetApp proposal. We are highly impressed with your business and your team, and we are confident that a business combination will deliver substantial benefits to your company's stockholders, customers, employees and partners. We are disappointed that we were not given an opportunity to explore a business combination prior to the announcement of your proposed transaction with NetApp, particularly since I believe you should have been aware of our interest.
EMC proposes to acquire all outstanding Data Domain common stock for $30.00 per share in cash. This price represents a 20% premium to NetApp's cash and stock offer and is a Superior Proposal as defined in your merger agreement with NetApp. The Board of EMC has unanimously approved this proposal.
EMC's proposal is not subject to any financing or due diligence contingency, and we will use existing cash balances to finance the transaction.
In order to consummate this transaction quickly, we intend to effect a first step tender offer for all outstanding Data Domain common stock followed by a second step merger for any remaining shares. We are enclosing with this letter a form of agreement to effect our proposed
 
transaction which is substantially identical to the agreement between you and NetApp except as to our superior price and except for changes reflecting our faster two-step structure. We are prepared to execute this agreement immediately upon your Board of Directors' determination that EMC has made a Superior Proposal as provided in the merger agreement with NetApp. We are utilizing the two-step structure to enable us to pay Data Domain's stockholders as quickly as possible after signing a definitive agreement, and to further expedite this timing, we are promptly commencing the tender offer. Consistent with the terms of your agreement with NetApp, we expect to follow the process set forth in the Annex to this letter to enter into a signed agreement with Data Domain as quickly as possible.
In comparison to your proposed transaction with NetApp, EMC's proposal represents a far superior alternative for your stockholders.
 
 
 
A transaction with EMC also represents a far more compelling alternative to your customers, employees and partners. For example:
 
 
 
 
 
We will maintain the senior management team under your leadership and operate Data Domain as a product division within EMC. As a part of EMC, Data Domain will have access to EMC's superior global resources and we will enhance this division with additional EMC technology, products and capital. The combination with EMC represents a unique opportunity for your management team and employees to benefit from the greater resources of EMC and to become important leaders within a larger organization committed to leadership in next-generation information infrastructure solutions.
EMC has a long and distinguished track record of skillfully acquiring and integrating leading technology companies. Because of our considerable experience, I am confident that we can successfully integrate our companies, retain the talented employees of Data Domain and realize the full potential of this combination.
We look forward to executing the definitive agreement attached.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Joseph M. Tucci
Joseph M. Tucci
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 23, 2009  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported second-quarter 2009 revenue of $3.26 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and second-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC of $205.2 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. A continued focus on its technology leadership, global sales and service execution and achieving maximum operating efficiencies contributed to EMC's sequential revenue and profit growth.
Second-quarter consolidated revenue of $3.26 billion declined 11% compared with the year-ago period or 8% adjusting for the impact from currency. Second-quarter 2009 GAAP net income attributable to EMC was $205.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $360.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008. Second-quarter 2009 non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC was $358.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $494.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008.
2
In the second quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $574 million, free cash flow of $400 million and ended the quarter with record cash and investments of $10 billion. Year to date EMC generated operating cash flow of $1.44 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "This marks another quarter of solid execution, and I am proud of the EMC and VMware teams around the world that produced these results. We are focused on four of the hottest and fastest-growing areas of IT spending  next-generation fully virtualized data centers; cloud computing; virtualized desktops and clients; and next-generation backup, recovery and archive solutions. This, together with our market leading products, solutions, services and proven go-to-market model gives us confidence that EMC will continue to gain market share this year. When IT markets resume to more normal spending rates, we expect EMC will return to generating double-digit revenue growth."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "While global conditions remain challenging and our full-year view of declining IT spending remains unchanged, EMC's second-quarter financial performance reflects customers' budget stabilization and improved business predictability. Continued focus on helping customers address their most pressing IT priorities helped EMC's Information Infrastructure business achieve balanced sequential revenue growth across all major geographies and in every business unit. Our sustained focus on cost containment and operational efficiency helped drive sequential growth in our Information Infrastructure gross and operating margins."
Second-Quarter Highlights
EMC's Information Infrastructure business revenue for the second quarter  comprising Information Storage, RSA Security, and Content Management & Archiving  was $2.80 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. The business was driven by strong sequential growth of the company's market-leading EMC CLARiiON mid-tier storage systems; EMC Celerra unified storage systems; EMC's backup and recovery software; RSA information security solutions; and EMC Global Services. During the quarter, the business also benefited from new, industry-leading products, technology integrations and product enhancements from across EMC's Information Infrastructure portfolio. Second-quarter highlights also included customer demand for EMC's:
 
 
 
 
EMC also announced today the successful completion of its tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of Data Domain, Inc., with stockholders tendering approximately 90.3% of outstanding Data Domain shares. Together with the 3.9% of outstanding Data Domain shares EMC previously purchased, EMC now controls approximately 94.2% of Data Domain shares outstanding. EMC expects to effect a second-step merger and close its acquisition of Data Domain today. Upon completion of the acquisition, Data Domain will form the foundation of a new, high-growth product division within EMC's Information Storage business focused on the development and delivery of next-generation disk-based backup, recovery and archive solutions. For its quarter ending June 30, 2009, Data Domain achieved consolidated revenues of nearly $86 million, an increase of 40% compared with the year ago period.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, contributed second-quarter revenue of $455 million.
EMC consolidated second-quarter revenue from the United States was $1.68 billion, up 3% sequentially, and represented 52% of total second-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's operations outside of the United States was $1.58 billion, up 4% sequentially, and represented 48% of total second-quarter revenue.

The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) litigation that we may be involved in; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization and restructuring and other special charges) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on July 23, 2009, EMC effected a short-form merger of Envoy with and into Data Domain, with Data Domain continuing as the surviving corporation (the ""), without the need for a vote or meeting of Data Domain stockholders. Each outstanding Share not purchased in the Offer (other than Shares owned by EMC, Envoy or any wholly owned subsidiary of EMC or Data Domain, Shares held in the treasury of Data Domain, or Shares that are held by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) is by virtue of the Merger, and without action by the holder thereof, canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $33.50 per Share without interest and less any required withholding taxes. As a result of the Merger, Data Domain is now a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC.
Merger
On July 23, 2009, EMC issued a press release announcing the expiration of the subsequent offering period, the successful completion of the Offer and its intention to consummate the Merger. The full text of the press release issued by EMC is set forth as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

Gelsinger and Elias will report to Joe Tucci, EMC's Chairman and CEO, and join the Executive Office of the Chairman. Under their leadership, EMC will continue to strengthen and advance its market leadership for information infrastructure products and services as it marches to address four of the fastest-growing IT market opportunities  next-generation fully virtualized data centers, cloud computing, virtualized desktops and clients, and next-generation backup and recovery solutions.
Gelsinger joins EMC from Intel where he most recently served as Senior Vice President and Co-General Manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, the company's largest business group accounting for more than half of Intel's annual revenue. Under Gelsinger's leadership, this group is responsible for Intel's enterprise products including clients (PC's), Server (Xeon and Itanium), Embedded, Communications, Visualization and Storage products. The group is also responsible for the award-winning Nehalem microarchitecture product development.
Joe Tucci said, "We consider ourselves highly fortunate to welcome to EMC an executive of Pat Gelsinger's stature and depth of credentials. The totality of what EMC information infrastructure means to our customers worldwide has never been more critical.

We also now possess one of the strongest and most talented management leadership teams in technology. I've never been more excited about what we see ahead for EMC."
Pat Gelsinger said, "Over the last three decades, Intel has provided me with extraordinary opportunities and the ultimate executive proving ground. For that I remain forever grateful. I'm also thrilled with the road ahead and prospect of helping lead a company of EMC's stature. The technology industry has undergone almost incomprehensible change over the last three decades since I entered it. The rate and pace of change and challenge is not abating in the slightest. EMC is extremely well positioned to play a pivotal role in the IT industry for decades to come, and I am privileged to join Joe and his EMC leadership team in that endeavor."
Howard Elias has served as President, EMC Global Services and EMC's Ionix IT management group for the last three years, overseeing EMC's award-winning global Customer Support organizations, Professional and Managed Services, EMC Consulting, and Global Presales and Education Services along with the Ionix resource management software portfolio.

I have the highest confidence in our success with Howard leading our services and David ensuring EMC continues to be financially strong and efficient around the world.
Tucci added, "Bill Teuber, the EMC Board and I extend a warm and heartfelt welcome to Howard, David and Pat as they join us to form the EMC Executive Office of the Chairman. These are three world-class leaders at the top of their game. We look forward to the impact of their combined vision, strategic view and operational excellence.

Under Joe's leadership, EMC has committed to achieving a leading position in new, high-growth markets, while also maintaining its clear market leadership in storage, security and infrastructure management. Joe has provided the vision and roadmap for this growth plan for the next three years. Equally important, it has been a hallmark of Joe's leadership over his more than seven years as CEO to bring exceptional, new executive talent to EMC from among the best companies in the technology industry. The recruitment of Pat Gelsinger adds to an already strong and deep team in the Office of the Chairman, including Howard Elias, David Goulden, and our current Vice Chairman, Bill Teuber. We are confident this team can meet our growth objectives and stand up to any challenge in this industry."
Tucci added, "I very much appreciate the Board's confidence in me and look forward to the future with great enthusiasm. EMC is remarkably well positioned to succeed in the information infrastructure solutions marketplace. We see enormous opportunity, despite the current economic climate, and we will be aggressive in pursuing it from every vantage and with every asset we have."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) litigation that we may be involved in; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to gains on Data Domain and SpringSource common stock, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, special income tax benefit and restructuring charge) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
The following costs are included in EMC Consolidated Non-GAAP and EMC Information Infrastructure Non-GAAP results
 
 
Note: schedule may not add due to rounding
 
 
The following costs are included in EMC Consolidated Non-GAAP and EMC Information Infrastructure Non-GAAP results
 
 
Note: schedule may not add due to rounding
 
 
 
Free cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 includes intercompany tax payments of $8.0 million and $93.4 million, respectively, from EMC Information Infrastructure to VMware within EMC.

On November 18, 2009, EMC Corporation's Board of Directors approved a plan to reorganize its international operations by transferring certain assets of its RSA and Data Domain entities and legacy foreign corporations owned directly by EMC into a single EMC international holding company. The international subsidiaries acquired in connection with its acquisitions of RSA and Data Domain will be combined into EMC's existing foreign companies. In connection with the reorganization, EMC's international holding company will issue to EMC Corporation approximately $4 billion of consideration consisting of stock and cash. This plan is part of EMC's ongoing cost transformation program and is intended to facilitate EMC's international expansion, reduce costs, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's organizational structure, further strengthen the company's operations and position the company for improved business agility in the future. EMC expects the new structure of its international subsidiaries to be completed in 2010.
In connection with the reorganization, EMC will incur a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This charge was not included in the business outlook previously provided by EMC in its third-quarter earnings press release dated October 22, 2009, and as a result, EMC is making the following revisions to its business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2009 and full-year 2009 solely to account for the charge:

We are well positioned to lead the industry's newest and potentially largest wave of IT, which we and others refer to as cloud computing. As we execute on our vision for where the industry is heading, EMC's primary focus is on helping customers safely build out their next-generation, fully virtualized data centers and lead them along the journey to private cloud computing, which offers the promise of a dramatically more efficient and effective model for delivering IT as a service."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Emerging from the worst global recession in company history, EMC is in the best financial and operational shape ever. We refined our financial model to a new level of efficiency and cost discipline, while continuing to invest in strategic technologies and high-growth markets. We rolled out new and more-advanced solutions and services with the best quality in our history and gained market share. With this positive momentum, EMC stands well positioned to continue to gain share in key markets and drive even greater profitability in 2010."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) litigation that we may be involved in; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to gains on Data Domain and SpringSource common stock, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, special income tax charge, stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, IPR&D charge, special income tax benefit and restructuring charge) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
Certain items in the accompanying schedules refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of EMC's business performance. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into US dollars at the exchange rate applied in each month of the prior year quarter. Constant currency includes the impacts from EMC's hedging program.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

On February 26, 2010, EMC Corporation ("EMC") filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "10-K"). As disclosed in the 10-K, EMC reported certain adjustments made since its earnings announcement on January 26, 2010 which affect its 2009 financial statements. EMC has adjusted its fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial statements by recognizing a pre-tax charge of $57.5 million ($52.3 million after tax) for a provision for litigation. Additionally, EMC adjusted its fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial statements for the estimated costs associated with reorganizing its international operations into a single EMC foreign holding company by reducing the tax provision by $16.5 million. These adjustments decreased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and $0.02 for the fourth quarter and the full year 2009, respectively. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and calendar 2009 remained unchanged from the previously reported amounts of $0.33 and $0.90, respectively.
Attached to this Form 8-K are supplemental schedules which update the information previously provided at EMC's earnings announcement on January 26, 2010 to reflect the adjustments referred to above.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOPKINTON, Mass.  March 2, 2010  EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a stock purchase program to allow the company to make open market purchases of VMware Class A common stock in order to maintain EMC's approximately 80% majority ownership at its current level over the long term.
The stock purchase program underscores VMware's role in EMC's strategic direction and acknowledges VMware's leading position as the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop through the data center and to the cloud, and as one of the IT industry's most compelling value propositions.
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said, "The public offering of VMware's stock has enabled EMC to expose the value of VMware to the public markets, attract and retain the best talent in the industry and continually reinforce VMware's commitment to an open platform strategy. We believe maintaining EMC's ownership level in VMware at approximately 80% allows us to continue to achieve the above objectives while also maximizing value for EMC shareholders over the long term."

We are confident in our ability to lead the next major wave of IT, maintain a long-term double-digit revenue growth rate and continue to take share."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "During the first quarter, we saw customers move forward with increased confidence, focusing not only on cost cutting initiatives, but beginning new innovative projects in their traditional and virtual data center infrastructures. This helped us clearly achieve the triple play' we projected last quarter by gaining market share while investing for the future and increasing profitability. Looking ahead, we remain confident that we'll continue to execute on all three of these areas."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiv) litigation that we may be involved in; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to restructuring and acquisition-related charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  July 21, 2010  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today reported record financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Consistently strong execution across the business and healthy customer demand across all geographies contributed to EMC achieving its third consecutive quarter of record revenue and reporting net income that more than doubled on a year-over-year basis.
For the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $4.02 billion, an increase of 24% compared with the year-ago quarter; GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 108% year over year to $426 million; and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.20, up 100% year over year. Non-GAAP

1
earnings per diluted share were $0.28, an increase of 56% year over year.
During the quarter, EMC expanded gross and operating margins substantially on a year-over-year basis. The company achieved all-time record year-to-date operating cash flow and free cash flow of $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, which grew 44% and 47%, respectively, compared with the year-ago period. The company completed the quarter with $10.3 billion in cash and investments.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The strength and demand that we saw during the quarter is testament to the value our customers see in our information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure solutions and the massive opportunity before us. The IT industry is in the midst of a major transformation to cloud computing and, ultimately, to a more agile way to consume and deliver IT. Never in our history have we had a stronger team, more compelling vision, or more innovative set of technologies, services, and partnerships. As a result, EMC is in an excellent position to lead this dramatic shift in IT and provide our customers with a clear path forward on their journey to the cloud."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "For the second consecutive quarter, EMC once again turned a triple play' by gaining market share while investing for the future and increasing profitability. With this, we also expanded gross and operating margins and generated all-time record year-to-date operating and free cash flow. Moving forward, we remain confident that we have the right business and operating model to continue delivering annual double-digit revenue and earnings growth over the long term."

On December 30, 2010, EMC Corporation's Board of Directors approved a plan to transfer its newly acquired Isilon and Bus-Tech businesses to its international holding company. This plan is intended to build upon and further facilitate EMC's international expansion, reduce costs and continue improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's worldwide operating structure by enabling these businesses to leverage EMC's international sales and services organizations and back office infrastructure. Additionally, the businesses will be able to utilize EMC's global Manufacturing Center of Excellence to oversee worldwide product manufacturing and its global R&D Centers of Excellence to further enhance their product offerings.
In connection with the reorganization, EMC incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This charge was not included in the business outlook previously provided by EMC in its third-quarter earnings press release dated October 19, 2010, and as a result, EMC is making the following revisions to its business outlook for 2010 solely to account for the charge. Our outlook with respect to our consolidated GAAP diluted earnings per share is being revised from $0.91 to $0.87 for 2010. Our outlook with respect to our consolidated GAAP income tax rate is being revised from 20% to 24% for 2010. The charge will not impact our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share or tax rate or any of the other non-GAAP outlook provided in our previous press release.
These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof.

During the quarter EMC generated record quarterly operating cash flow and free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, which grew 50% and 54% year over year, respectively. For the quarter and full-year 2010, EMC expanded gross margin and operating margin percentages substantially on a year-over-year basis. The company completed the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments.
For the full year 2010, consolidated revenue was $17.0 billion, an increase of 21% year over year; GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 75% year over year to $1.9 billion; and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.88, up 66% year over year. Non-GAAP

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC's performance in 2010 was the best in company history, marked by rapid growth, market share gains, financial leverage and significant investment in technology innovation. The platform for change in the IT industry has arrived with the biggest opportunity residing at the intersection of trusted cloud computing, enterprise data and Big Data.' Equipped with the strongest, most distinctive product and services portfolio and strategic partners, we have never been more confident in EMC's position to lead this transformational shift to IT as a service."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "In 2010 we executed our triple play impressively  simultaneously taking market share, reinvesting meaningfully in our business and delivering improved profitability. Tremendous progress on all of these objectives throughout the year puts EMC in its best financial and operational shape ever. We are in great position to continue to deliver our triple play results in 2011; continue to achieve solid double-digit revenue and profit growth, expand operating margins and grow free cash flow for the year; and further strengthen EMC's strategic position for the long term."
Fourth-Quarter and 2010 Highlights
Fourth-quarter highlights included strong customer demand and double-digit revenue growth for the company's market-leading high-end EMC Symmetrix storage product portfolio, which increased 19% compared with the year-ago quarter, and EMC's mid-tier storage product portfolio
3
, which grew revenue 23% year over year. Revenues from EMC's RSA information security business and VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, hit record amounts, growing 28% and 38% year over year, respectively. Additional fourth-quarter highlights included continued strong customer demand for EMC's backup and recovery solutions as part of the company's fast-growing Backup and Recovery Systems Division. Also in the fourth quarter, EMC completed its acquisition of Isilon Systems, a leader in fast-growing "scale-out" network attached storage.
EMC consolidated fourth-quarter revenue from the United States reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 20% year over year, representing 53% of consolidated fourth-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States reached $2.3 billion, an increase of 19% year over year, representing 47% of consolidated fourth-quarter revenue. Within this, revenue increased 13%, 30% and 34% year over year, respectively, in EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific and Japan; and Latin America regions.
Throughout 2010, EMC executed on numerous strategic initiatives that collectively helped strengthen the company's technology leadership and services expertise in enterprise data, cloud computing and "Big Data"; advance its competitive lead; and gain market share. This included sustained aggressive investment in research and development, totaling 11% of annual consolidated 2010 revenue, which resulted in broad and deep innovation across all of EMC's business units. EMC also continued to use its financial strength to make strategic acquisitions targeted at high-growth areas, including Isilon, data warehousing and business analytics pioneer Greenplum, and leading enterprise governance, risk and compliance (eGRC) software provider Archer Technologies. Additionally, the company further strengthened alignment with strategic partners demonstrated by the strong momentum of VCE, The Virtual Computing Environment Company, and expanded relationships with technology, solutions and service providers around the world.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (iv) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (v) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (viii) component and product quality and availability; (ix) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) war or acts of terrorism; (xii) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xiii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; and (xiv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to restructuring and acquisition-related charges, stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, special income tax charges, provisions for litigation and amounts relating to gains on Data Domain and SpringSource common stock) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On March 17, 2011, RSA, the Security Division of EMC ("RSA"), posted an open letter from Arthur W. Coviello, Jr., Executive Chairman, RSA, to its customers on its website and issued a SecurCare Online note directly to its customers. Based on what EMC Corporation ("EMC") currently knows, EMC does not believe that the matter described in the letter and note will have a material impact on its financial results. The letter and note are being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: March 17, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Open Letter to RSA Customers
Like any large company, EMC experiences and successfully repels multiple cyber attacks on its IT infrastructure every day. Recently, our security systems identified an extremely sophisticated cyber attack in progress being mounted against RSA. We took a variety of aggressive measures against the threat to protect our business and our customers, including further hardening our IT infrastructure. We also immediately began an extensive investigation of the attack and are working closely with the appropriate authorities.
Our investigation has led us to believe that the attack is in the category of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Our investigation also revealed that the attack resulted in certain information being extracted from RSA's systems. Some of that information is specifically related to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products. While at this time we are confident that the information extracted does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation as part of a broader attack. We are very actively communicating this situation to RSA customers and providing immediate steps for them to take to strengthen their SecurID implementations.
We have no evidence that customer security related to other RSA products has been similarly impacted. We are also confident that no other EMC products were impacted by this attack. It is important to note that we do not believe that either customer or employee personally identifiable information was compromised as a result of this incident.
Our first priority is to ensure the security of our customers and their trust. We are committed to applying all necessary resources to give our SecurID customers the tools, processes and support they require to strengthen the security of their IT systems in the face of this incident. Our full support will include a range of RSA and EMC internal resources as well as close engagement with our partner ecosystems and our customers' relevant partners.
We regret any inconvenience or concern that this attack on RSA may cause for customers, and we strongly urge you to follow the steps we've outlined in our SecurCare Online note. APT threats are becoming a significant challenge for all large corporations, and it's a topic I have discussed publicly many times. As appropriate, we will share our experiences from these attacks with our customers, partners and the rest of the security vendor ecosystem and work in concert with these organizations to develop means to better protect all of us from these growing and ever more sophisticated forms of cyber security threat.
Sincerely,
/s/ Art Coviello

Exhibit 99.2
SCOL Note Title:
Required Actions for SecurID Installations
Dear RSA SecurCare Online Customer,
Summary:
We have determined that a recent attack on RSA's systems has resulted in certain information being extracted from RSA's systems that relates to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products. While at this time we are confident that the information extracted does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation as part of a broader attack. RSA urges immediate action.
Description:
Recently EMC's security systems identified an extremely sophisticated cyber attack in progress, targeting our RSA business unit. We took a variety of aggressive measures against the threat to protect our business and our customers, including further hardening of our IT infrastructure. We also immediately began an extensive investigation of the attack and are working closely with the appropriate authorities.
Our investigation has revealed that the attack resulted in certain information being extracted from RSA's systems. Some of that information is related to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products. While at this time we are confident that the information extracted does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation as part of a broader attack.
We strongly urge immediate customer attention to this advisory, and we are providing immediate remediation steps for customers to take to strengthen their RSA SecurID implementations.
Affected Products:
The affected products are RSA SecurID implementations.
Overall Recommendations:
RSA strongly urges customers to follow both these overall recommendations and the recommendations available in the best practices guides linked to this note.

HOPKINTON, Mass.  April 20, 2011  EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported record financial results for the first quarter of 2011. Continued healthy customer demand for EMC's information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure products and services, and strong performance within the company's Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific/Japan regions, contributed to EMC achieving record first-quarter consolidated revenue, record first-quarter net income, and strong year-over-year percentage increase in operating and gross margins.
First-quarter consolidated revenue was $4.6 billion, an increase of 18% compared with the year-ago quarter. First-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 28% year over year to $477.1 million. First-quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.21, up 24% year over year. Non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC for the first quarter was $700.4 million, an increase of 27% compared with the year-ago quarter. First-quarter non-GAAP
1
earnings per diluted share were $0.31, an increase of 19% year over year.
During the first quarter, EMC expanded gross and operating margins substantially on a year-over-year basis. The company achieved operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and free cash flow
2
of $857.3 million, and ended the first quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "EMC is off to a strong start in 2011 with significant opportunity and long-term growth potential ahead. With market-leading virtualization and information infrastructure products and services, and a strong partner ecosystem, we are positioned squarely at the intersection of two of the most sweeping trends in IT  cloud computing and Big Data. These assets, along with a robust innovation pipeline, uniquely align EMC to help customers accelerate their journey to cloud computing and unlock the full value of their information."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "For the fifth consecutive quarter EMC achieved our financial triple play'  gaining market share, investing aggressively to take advantage of the rapidly emerging opportunities offered by cloud computing and Big Data, and improving profitability. Financial strength and flexibility, combined with an intense focus on customers, enable us to continually identify and successfully execute on opportunities that increase our value proposition to customers and reward shareholders. Given the strong growth we saw in the quarter and the opportunity we see throughout 2011, we are now even more confident that we can meet and potentially exceed our 2011 consolidated revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow goals while continuing to achieve our triple play' over the long term."
First-Quarter Highlights
First-quarter highlights included strong customer demand for the company's market-leading high-end EMC Symmetrix storage product portfolio, which increased revenue 25% compared with the year-ago quarter, and EMC's portfolio of mid-tier storage products
3
, which grew revenue 20% year over year. Revenue from VMware (NYSE: VMW), which is majority-owned by EMC, increased 33% and revenue from EMC's RSA information security business grew 8% year over year. Additional first-quarter highlights included consistently strong revenue growth for EMC's backup and recovery solutions, led by EMC Data Domain products. The new Isilon Storage Division exceeded revenue expectations in its first quarter within EMC, while the Data Computing Division continued to perform well with highly differentiated Greenplum offerings in the Big Data warehousing and analytics space.
Also during the quarter, VCE  the Virtual Computing Environment Company formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel  experienced increasing customer traction and an expanding pipeline for its Vblock converged architecture.

Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 26% year over year, representing 49% of consolidated first-quarter revenue.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to restructuring and acquisition-related charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

our ability to continue delivering strong results this year and over the long term. Furthermore, we remain committed to investing heavily to extend our technology lead and help customers and service provider partners accelerate their IT and business model transformations."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to restructuring and acquisition-related charges, stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, a non-recurring gain on strategic investments and an RSA special charge) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

With
the strategy, products and momentum in our favor, EMC remains extremely well positioned to help customers accelerate their journey to the cloud, discover the value of Big Data and transform IT into a source of greater efficiency, agility and control."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The priorities we have outlined in our financial triple play' to gain market share, invest aggressively to take full advantage of the massive opportunities at the intersection of cloud computing and Big Data, and improve profitability  continue to guide us through 2011.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization and restructuring and acquisition-related charges) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

There's no doubt that cloud computing is completely transforming the IT industry and that Big Data promises to have a similarly profound effect on transforming the way we work and live. Our customers and partners have these transformations in their sights and are embracing EMC's vision, strategy and best-of-breed portfolio to capitalize on them and realize the full potential of their information assets."
David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "In 2011 we once again executed our triple play  simultaneously taking market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering improved earnings. With this momentum, we entered 2012 exceptionally well positioned to maintain our operational excellence, execute our growth strategy, and continue delivering our triple play results. We expect to grow over two times faster than our estimate of IT spending growth to achieve 2012 consolidated revenue of $22 billion, GAAP EPS of $1.24 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70."
Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Highlights
For the fourth quarter, EMC's Information Storage business increased revenue 12% year over year. Within this, EMC's high-end Symmetrix storage product portfolio revenue increased 11% compared with the year-ago quarter and mid-tier storage products
4
revenue grew 24% year over year. Fourth-quarter revenue from VMware (NYSE: VMW) increased 27% year over year and revenue from EMC's RSA Information Security business grew 16% year over year.
Fourth-quarter highlights also included strong revenue growth for both the EMC VNX unified storage family, which was selected by nearly 2,000 new customers in the quarter, and the company's Backup Recovery Systems (BRS) portfolio. Within the BRS portfolio, the combined annualized revenue run rate for EMC Data Domain and EMC Avamar in the quarter exceeded $2 billion. Additionally, revenue from EMC's Isilon portfolio once again more than doubled year over year. During the quarter, EMC continued to experience strong customer demand for its consulting and professional services to help build out their cloud architectures, and for EMC Greenplum solutions to leverage their Big Data assets. Finally, VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, continued to close in on the company's billion-dollar annualized revenue run-rate target as customer adoption of Vblock Converged Infrastructure Platforms increased significantly on a year-over-year basis.
EMC's consolidated fourth-quarter revenue from the United States reached an all-time record of $3.0 billion, an increase of 16% year over year, representing 54% of consolidated fourth-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States reached an all-time record $2.6 billion, an increase of 12% year over year, representing 46% of consolidated fourth-quarter revenue. Within this, revenue increased 6%, 26% and 26% year over year, respectively, in EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific and Japan; and Latin America regions.
Throughout 2011, EMC strengthened its technology leadership and services expertise in cloud computing and Big Data, advanced its competitive lead, and gained market share. Numerous strategic initiatives contributed to these achievements, including sustained aggressive investment in research and development, totaling 11% of annual consolidated 2011 revenue. The introduction of new products such as the EMC VNX unified storage and EMC Symmetrix VMAX families and products from EMC's Isilon, Data Domain and Avamar portfolios contributed to market share gains and the expansion of the company's addressable market in 2011. Additionally, EMC further strengthened alignment with strategic partners as demonstrated by the strong momentum of VCE and expanded relationships with technology, solutions and service providers around the world. In 2011, more than 1,700 partners began selling EMC products for the first time, significantly expanding the company's partner ecosystem.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, a special income tax charge, an RSA special charge, a gain on strategic investments, and the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods beginning in 2012) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons.

This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are in a time of unprecedented IT and business transformation, propelled by the benefits of cloud computing, Big Data and trust. EMC is off to a strong start to 2012 and is exceptionally well-positioned to help customers take advantage of these major transformational shifts. We have never been more excited about what this great technology company can accomplish and look forward to helping our customers drive maximum value from their IT investments in the years ahead."

Based upon our strong start to the year and our opportunity, we now have greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2012 financial goals for consolidated revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Additionally, with continued steady execution, we are well on our way to achieving the financial potential of 2014 consolidated revenue of over $28 billion, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even greater than this."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges and the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

News Summary:
 
Full Story:
EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today announced that 17-year EMC veteran and Vice Chairman Bill Teuber (60), will take on additional corporate-wide responsibilities for EMC as a member of the Office of the Chairman. In his new role, Teuber will focus on strategy and business development in emerging markets, assist with government relations and work closely with the Board of Directors. In addition, Teuber will continue his sponsorship of EMC's largest customer accounts and work with Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci and EMC's executive team to develop future leaders.
EMC today also announced a series of senior sales executive appointments that represent a cornerstone for the company's next phase of global business growth. The new appointments and promotions showcase the depth and breadth of EMC's executive management and mark the implementation of the company's longstanding sales and executive succession planning.
The company announced the appointment of EMC veteran executive Bill Scannell (50) to lead EMC's Global Sales & Customer Operations, a role formerly held by Bill Teuber. Since joining EMC in 1986, Scannell has held a variety of international and domestic sales management positions. Most recently, he has been responsible for driving revenue growth across EMC's full range of products and services in North America, Latin America and EMEA. Combined, these regions contributed approximately 85 percent of EMC's global revenues in 2011.
EMC also announced today new sales leadership for the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) regions. John Hanlon (49), previously EMC leader for U.S. Commercial business, will assume responsibility for sales and customer operations in the Americas. European native Adrian McDonald (48), previously EMC leader for EMEA North, will assume responsibility for sales and customer operations across all of EMEA. New Zealand native David Webster (52), previously leader for Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia, will assume responsibility for sales and customer operations in Asia Pacific and Japan. Webster succeeds Steve Leonard, who takes a new role focused on further building out EMC's presence in emerging markets, after growing EMC APJ sales from $1.1 billion in 2006 to $2.6 billion in 2011. Leonard will remain based in Asia and continue to report directly to Teuber in the Office of the Chairman. Joe Eazor (49), who previously oversaw EMC's global customer accounts and OEMs, will assume additional responsibility as COO, Global Sales & Customer Operations, focusing on sales strategy and managing key global sales functions to support growth. Scannell, Eazor, Hanlon, McDonald and Webster have a combined 72 years of EMC sales experience and a strong reputation for providing the best customer experience in the industry.
EMC Executive Quotes:

I'm thrilled to have his commitment to help continue to lead EMC with a focus on expanding our presence in emerging markets, deepening our relationships with key customers and mentoring the growing number of talented EMC executives.
Bill Scannell is a world-class sales leader and an outstanding executive with a superb track record of execution, developing our sales team and providing the best customer experience in the industry.

Bill Teuber, Vice Chairman, EMC Corporation
"It's been an honor to have led EMC's worldwide sales organization over the previous five years. EMC stands apart through an extraordinary depth of executive sales leadership with a wealth of EMC and industry experience. The time is right for Bill Scannell to step up and help lead EMC's next major phase of growth, and I'm proud to hand over the reins to him and his team. I'd also like to thank Steve Leonard for his leadership and execution in Asia Pacific and Japan over the past five years. His experience and knowledge of the region will continue to be a tremendous asset as we enter into our next phase of growth."

"EMC and VMware have delivered strong results over the past decade and have developed world-class management teams," said Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO. "Today we are witnessing an extraordinary transformation in the IT industry unlike anything we have seen before  a major shift to Cloud Computing, Big Data applications and delivering IT-as-a-Service. To capitalize on this tremendous opportunity we are positioning our executive talent so that we can benefit from their exceptional professional strengths with the goal of further advantaging EMC and VMware to deliver long-term value to our respective shareholders."
Key among the executive appointments to drive future growth, EMC announced that:
 
 
 
Tucci said, "With these changes, David will assume responsibility for EMC's Information Infrastructure business, Pat will now lead Cloud Infrastructure at VMware, and Paul will look across our technology strategy with a particular focus on Big Data and the next generation of cloud-oriented applications that will be built on top of these foundations."
Goulden (53), a 10-year senior EMC veteran, will effective immediately assume full responsibility for EMC's Business Units, Sales and Customer Operations, Services, Marketing and G&A functions. Goulden's experience at EMC has been broad based and has included managing Global Sales, Marketing, Alliances and Business Development. He has also been instrumental in making M&A a core competency for EMC by playing a leading role in nearly 70 acquisitions since 2003. Goulden will also continue to serve as EMC's CFO, a position he has held since 2006.
"David Goulden is a remarkable executive and proven leader with an extraordinary command of EMC's business," said Tucci. "He has led just about every aspect of our business, driven major change initiatives across the company and helped design innovative business models. He and his team have also been instrumental to EMC's long-term financial success. All of this coupled with David's broad EMC experience and deep industry knowledge makes him the perfect choice to become President and COO."
Goulden said, "EMC is very well positioned to benefit from almost every major trend in IT  flash storage, converged infrastructure, Big Data and cloud security to name just a few. I look forward to continuing to execute on EMC's strategy and working with such a talented team who embody EMC's high-performance culture."
In joining EMC, Maritz (57), will be driving our efforts in EMC's technology strategy with a particular focus in Big Data and the next generation of cloud-oriented applications. Maritz, who was one of the early leaders of Microsoft before becoming CEO of VMware, will also assume responsibility for EMC's CTO Office, M&A, strategic investments and emerging technologies.
"Paul Maritz is one of the brightest minds in the IT industry. He has created a compelling and lasting vision that has transformed VMware from a technology leader in virtualization to a category leader in cloud computing," said Tucci. "Paul leaves VMware in an enviable strategic position and in great financial health. We are delighted to have Paul join the leadership team at EMC and look forward to working with him as he leads our technology strategy and directs our efforts on Big Data and emerging applications."
Pat Gelsinger (51) joined EMC in 2009 as President and COO of EMC Information Infrastructure Products. Gelsinger has overseen the introduction of the largest product set in EMC history, accelerated EMC's push into unified storage and led EMC into new market segments including Big Data and flash storage.
"Pat Gelsinger's leadership and technology vision have both transformed and strengthened EMC's broad product portfolio since his arrival," said Tucci. "Pat's unique experience in understanding how software can add value to standard hardware building blocks, as well as his deep understanding of the x86 partner ecosystem and his track record running large scale organizations make him the natural choice to further enhance VMware's competitive positioning and lead VMware through its next phase of growth."

Burton assumes responsibility for EMC's cross business unit product operations, corporate go-to-market functions, OEM and volume channel initiatives.
"The business we have built is at the intersection of three of the most transformative secular trends in the history of IT  Cloud, Big Data and Trust, and I've never been more excited about the opportunity ahead for EMC," said Tucci. "I remain fully committed and energized to lead this great company as Chairman and CEO through at least 2013."

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am very pleased with EMC's execution and record second-quarter financial performance. We are seeing a transformation in the IT industry unlike anything we have seen before. Organizations are moving quickly to adopt cloud computing and take advantage of both the efficiency and agility that comes with running IT-as-a-Service. Customers are also looking to deploy a new generation of Big Data applications to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their businesses. And they demand that all this be done in a secure and trusted way. EMC is widely recognized as a leader and driver of this transformation."
David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "The business we have built is at the intersection of three of the most transformative waves in the history of IT  cloud computing, Big Data and trust. We have grown EMC profitably, expanded our portfolio of products and services into new markets, and established our reputation for quality and providing customers with the very best total experience in the industry. Looking ahead, we remain on track to deliver our triple play'  simultaneously taking market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering improved earnings  and are well positioned for our next major phase of growth."

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods, a RSA special charge (release), a gain on strategic investment and a loss on interest rate swaps) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Schedule may not add due to rounding.
 
 
 
 
This presentation refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of EMC's business performance. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into US dollars at the exchange rate applied in each month of the prior year quarter. Constant currency includes the impacts from EMC's hedging program.

EMC Reports Third-Quarter 2012 Financial Results
HOPKINTON, Mass. - October 24, 2012 - EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2012, highlighted by record third-quarter consolidated revenue, net income and EPS.
Third-quarter consolidated revenue was $5.28 billion, an increase of 6% compared with the year-ago quarter. Third-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 3% year over year to $626 million. Third-quarter GAAP earnings per weighted average diluted share increased 4% year over year to $0.28. Non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC for the third quarter was $881 million, an increase of 7% compared with the year-ago quarter. Third-quarter non-GAAP
1
earnings per weighted average diluted share were $0.40, an increase of 8% year over year.
During the third quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $1.44 billion and free cash flow
2
of $1.14 billion, a year-over-year increase of 12% and 16%, respectively. Additionally, the company ended the quarter with $10.6 billion in cash and investments.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, EMC's third-quarter revenue and profit growth reflect the resiliency of our business in a more uncertain global economic environment. We remain very well positioned to capitalize on - and drive - the transformative trends of cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT.  These major waves of change in IT become increasingly more important to customers and partners as they navigate through a cyclical slowdown, look to gain maximum value from their investments, and focus on their longer-term IT and business transformations. 
David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer, said, For the third quarter, EMC's business continued to grow faster than overall IT spending growth and we gained market share in what turned out to be a more cautionary environment than we expected heading into the quarter. We remain extremely confident in our strategy, best-of-breed product portfolio and solid operational and financial model. Going forward, we fully believe that EMC will continue to grow faster than our addressable markets and take share, reinvest for the future, and deliver earnings leverage for shareholders.
Third-Quarter Highlights
In the third quarter, revenue from EMC's networked storage platforms portfolio
3
, which includes EMC's high-end and mid-tier storage platform products, grew 2% year over year. Revenue from EMC's high-end Symmetrix storage product portfolio, which includes the company's VMAX systems family, increased 5% compared with the year-ago quarter. Revenue from the company's portfolio of mid-tier storage products
4
was flat year over year.
 
Other third-quarter highlights included continued customer demand for EMC's Isilon scale-out NAS products and the company's Backup Recovery Systems (BRS) portfolio. Adoption of EMC's VSPEX reference architecture solutions also gained momentum and popularity among customers and with partners who have sold more than 300 VSPEX solutions since their launch in April 2012. Customers also continued to increasingly turn to EMC's Greenplum product portfolio to gain insight and value from Big Data. Revenue from EMC's RSA Information Security business increased 6% year over year, driven by continued customer requirements for trusted IT solutions. VMware (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure, grew revenue 20% year over year. Additionally, EMC continued to experience solid demand for its broad portfolio of services to help customers accelerate their transition to cloud architectures and transform IT. Finally, VCE, formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, continued to gain traction in enterprise data centers and cloud service providers globally as demand for Vblock systems showed strong growth in the third quarter.
EMC's consolidated third-quarter revenue from the United States increased 8% year over year to $2.9 billion, representing 55% of consolidated third-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States increased 4% year over year to $2.4 billion and represented 45% of consolidated third-quarter revenue.

Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, EMC achieved its first $6 billion quarter for revenue, capping off a record breaking 2012. Driving our strong results is the strength of our leading-edge products and services, our solid operational and financial model, and consistent execution against our strategy. EMC remains squarely at the center of the most disruptive and opportunity-rich shift in IT history, propelled by the benefits of cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT.  These high-priority
IT spending areas are core to our strategic focus and represent market segments where EMC has established leadership positions and competitive advantage.
David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer, said, With outstanding execution by EMC employees worldwide, we once again delivered our triple play in 2012 - simultaneously taking market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering improved earnings.  EMC's broad, best-of-breed portfolio of products and services, which offer customers greater efficiency, control and choice as they transform both their IT and their businesses, is a key and differentiating element of our continued financial success.  We believe EMC is well positioned to expand our leadership in the market segments we serve, deliver on our triple play again in 2013, and leverage our strong balance sheet to invest heavily in leading edge technology for cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer
acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," (a) certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods beginning in 2012, an RSA special charge, a loss on interest rate swaps, a gain on strategic investment and special tax charges) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures and (b) the benefit of the R&D tax credit for 2012 is included in the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and includes the benefit of the R&D tax credit in, and excludes the above-listed items from, its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

EMC Reports First-Quarter 2013 Financial Results
HOPKINTON, Mass. - April 24, 2013 -
EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported first-quarter 2013 financial results that were highlighted by first-quarter records for consolidated revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and operating and free cash flow.
First-quarter revenue was $5.39 billion, an increase of 6% compared with the year-ago quarter.  First-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC was $580 million and first-quarter GAAP earnings per weighted average diluted share were $0.26.  Non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC was $850 million, an increase of 4% compared with the year-ago quarter.  Non-GAAP
1
earnings per weighted average diluted share were $0.39, an increase of 5% year over year. 
During the first quarter, EMC increased operating cash flow and free cash flow
2
on a year-over-year basis to $1.71 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively. First-quarter GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins grew on a year-over-year basis, and the company ended the quarter with $12 billion in cash and investments.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, EMC's solid first-quarter financial results speak to the strength of our execution and the soundness of our strategy that offers customers greater efficiency, control, choice and agility.  Our three federated businesses - EMC Information Infrastructure, VMware and Pivotal - are squarely focused on areas of IT that are expected to experience high growth over the next decade: cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT. Each business is chartered to build its own technology and partner ecosystem necessary to succeed, while staying aligned to leverage one another's strengths and to create value for our customers and shareholders.  I am incredibly energized by the strength of our business model and the way we have positioned the company to lead this transformative era in information technology.
David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer, said, EMC's focus on cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT helped drive solid revenue, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growth in the first quarter.  We believe EMC is extremely well-positioned to grow faster than the IT marketplace, produce leverage in the business and continue to innovate and evolve to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Our first-quarter results are consistent with the full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlook we provided in January, which remains unchanged. With continued steady execution, we
expect that EMC will achieve our previously stated longer-term potential of more than $30 billion in revenue in 2016 with non-GAAP EPS growth outpacing revenue growth during this timeframe.
First-Quarter Highlights
First-quarter revenue from EMC's Information Storage business grew 3% year over year. Highlights within this include: revenue from EMC's High-end Storage business
3
increased 10% year over year, and revenue from EMC's Emerging Storage business
4
increased 24% year over year. EMC's RSA Information Security business increased revenue 12% year over year, and EMC's Information Intelligence business returned to growth, increasing revenue 7% year over year.
EMC's VSPEX reference architecture solutions continued to gain momentum with rapid adoption and increasing popularity with customers and among partners who have sold just under 2,200 VSPEX solutions since their launch in April 2012. Demand for VCE's Vblock systems also showed strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Finally, EMC continued to expand its Service Provider Program with first-quarter revenue from service provider partners up over 40% year over year.
VMware (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure, grew revenue 13% year over year. Visit

Pivotal's mission is to deliver the world's most powerful enterprise platform-as-a-service enabling customers to build a new class of applications, leveraging big and fast data, and do all of this with the power of cloud independence. Today, Pivotal will also announce that General Electric Company (GE) plans to make a strategic investment of approximately $105 million in the company, representing a 10% equity stake. The companies will also announce their intent to enter into a broad research and development and commercial agreement aimed at accelerating GE's ability to create new analytic services and solutions for its customers.

Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP", certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods and the benefit of the 2012 R&D Tax Credit) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from, its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO
EMC has a long track record of creating value by aggressively investing in the business. Looking forward, the opportunity for EMC's continued success has never been better.

David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer
Our confidence in EMC's business model and the strength of our operational performance and free cash flow enable us to expand our capital allocation strategy in meaningful and lasting ways.
