LSI LOGIC EXCEEDS Q2 REVENUE AND EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS; GENERATES POSITIVE CASH FLOW Revenues increase for third sequential quarter; Bookings grow for fourth consecutive quarter Milpitas, California - LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported $438 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2002, a 6 percent sequential increase over the $413 million reported in the first quarter, and a 6 percent decrease from the $465 million reported in the second quarter of 2001. "Our second quarter results demonstrate that LSI Logic continues to gain momentum as all of our key metrics - revenues, gross margin and the bottom line - - are moving up and to the right," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "Our bookings increased sequentially each quarter for the past four quarters. We achieved positive operating cash flow in the second quarter. We are on target to return to pro forma profitability in the second half of the year. "The performance of our Storage Systems and Consumer businesses more than compensated for the weakness in the server and telecom sectors. During the quarter, our Storage Systems business produced strong results in both OEM and co-branded product sales. Our Storage Components Group recorded key design wins in the second quarter. Our Consumer business rebounded from first quarter seasonality and was driven by strong video game and DVD markets. In Communications, the enterprise sector continued its recovery and is expected to continue its growth trend." The 2002-second quarter GAAP net loss was reduced to $62 million or 17 cents a diluted share, a $109 million improvement over the first quarter. The lower 2002-second quarter GAAP net loss represented a $250 million improvement over the 2001-second quarter net loss. Cash and short-term investments grew $41 million sequentially and totaled $1.01 billion at the end of the second quarter. Pro forma 2002 second quarter net loss was $21 million or 6 cents a diluted share, a $21 million improvement over the pro forma first quarter 2002 net loss. The company reported a pro forma net loss of $21 million or 6 cents a diluted share in the second quarter of 2001. "LSI Logic continued its progress in executing its financial plan in Q2 and entered the second half of 2002 in a strong position both in terms of cash and short-term investments, and a healthy balance sheet," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer.
LSI LOGIC BUSINESS OUTLOOK LSI Logic expects 2002 Q3 revenues to grow about 10 percent sequentially from the $438 million reported in the second quarter. The company anticipates reporting a pro forma third quarter loss of about 2 cents a diluted share and gross margin of approximately 39 percent.

LSI LOGIC GENERATES POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR 3RD CONSECUTIVE QTR; REVENUES UP 18% Q4 2001- Q4 2002 MILPITAS, CALIFORNIA - LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported revenues of $480 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, a 1.5 percent sequential decrease compared to the $487 million reported in the third quarter, and an increase of 18 percent over the $406 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 fourth quarter GAAP** net loss was $31 million or 8 cents a diluted share. The third quarter net loss was $28 million or 7 cents a diluted share. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $250 million or 68 cents a diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2001. Pro forma* 2002 fourth quarter net income was $5 million or 1 cent a diluted share. Pro forma third quarter 2002 net income was $17 million or 4 cents a share. The company reported a pro forma net loss of $74 million or 20 cents a diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2001. Cash and short-term investments increased $47 million to $990 million at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased $48 million of convertible notes, reducing its outstanding convertible debt. "After generating 11 percent sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, our order input rate slowed in the fourth quarter," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "The strength of our two storage businesses was offset by declines in Consumer and Communications. As a result of this lower fourth quarter order-input rate, we are projecting first quarter revenues in the range of $370 million to $390 million. Entering 2003, our outlook is for the first quarter to be the low point for revenues, and for the second quarter to be up substantially. "Consumer, Storage Components and Storage Systems are expected to be the drivers for the second quarter improvement. The Communications sector has the least visibility, but generally we believe the enterprise sector is stabilizing while the WAN sector is unlikely to demonstrate improvement until late 2003 or 2004. We expect our overall business will regain momentum in the second quarter and return to pro forma profitability in the third quarter." LSI Logic recorded 2002 revenues of $1.82 billion, a 2 percent increase over the $1.78 billion in 2001. The GAAP 2002 net loss was $292 million or 79 cents a diluted share. The Pro Forma 2002 net loss was $42 million or 11 cents a diluted share. "We are generating positive operating cash flow, controlling operating expenses and reducing our long-term debt," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. ** Generally Accepted Accounting Principles * Earnings before acquisition-related amortization and other special items.
LSI LOGIC BUSINESS OUTLOOK LSI Logic expects Q1 2003 revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million. The company anticipates reporting a pro forma first quarter net loss of about 18-20 cents a diluted share and a gross margin of approximately 30-32 percent. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $180 million. The first quarter pro forma tax provision is expected to be a charge of approximately $6 million. Capital spending is anticipated to be under $20 million in the first quarter and less than $100 million for 2003. First quarter depreciation is projected to be about $60 million.

LSI LOGIC ANTICIPATES Q2 REVENUE GROWTH; LOWERS BREAK-EVEN POINT MILPITAS, CALIFORNIA - LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported revenues of $373 million in the first quarter of 2003, a 22 percent sequential decrease compared to the $480 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2002, and a decline of 10 percent compared to the $413 million reported in the first quarter of 2002. Cash and short-term investments increased $15 million to $1.0 billion at the end of the 2003 first quarter. The 2003 first quarter GAAP* net loss was $122 million or 33 cents a diluted share. The 2002 fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $31 million or 8 cents a diluted share. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $172 million or 47 cents a diluted share in the 2002 first quarter. First quarter net loss, excluding special items**, was $51 million or 14 cents a diluted share compared to fourth quarter 2002 net income, excluding special items, of $5 million or 1 cent a diluted share. The company reported a net loss, excluding special items, of $42 million or 12 cents a diluted share in the first quarter of 2002. "Excess retail inventory in consumer electronics led to greater than anticipated seasonality in our Consumer business,' said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "Lingering inventory in the enterprise networking supply chain also contributed to a difficult business environment in the first quarter. We are anticipating sequential revenue growth of 4-10 percent in the second quarter. "We recorded our first design wins with our RapidChip(TM) semiconductor platform and anticipate first revenues in the middle of the year. This new technology will strengthen our ASIC product offerings. We are targeting the return to profitability in the second half of the year on both an excluding special items and GAAP basis." Cost reduction actions taken in the first and second quarters are projected to reduce the company's break-even point to approximately $450 million quarterly revenue (excluding special items) and about $500 million quarterly revenue (GAAP), accelerating the return to profitability. These measures will reduce the company's global workforce by approximately 580 positions or 11 percent. "We are executing a financial plan that is generating cash, reducing our long-term debt, improving our cost structure and promoting growth in our targeted businesses," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer.

EXHIBIT 99.1
CC03-65
 LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) announced today the pricing of its offering of $350 million of convertible subordinated notes due in 2010 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
MILPITAS, CA.
The notes will bear interest at a rate of 4 percent per annum. They will be convertible into the company's common stock at a conversion price of $13.42 per share and will be subordinated to all present and future senior debt of the company. The company has also granted the initial purchaser of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $52.5 million principal amount of the notes. The sale of the notes is expected to close on May 16, 2003.
At the initial conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of notes will be convertible into approximately 75 shares of the company's common stock. The initial conversion price represents a 135 percent premium over the last reported sale price of the company's common stock on May 12, 2003, which was $5.71 per share.
The company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including the possible repayment, repurchase or refunding of its outstanding obligations, including its convertible notes. The company also intends to use approximately $28 million of the net proceeds of the offering to enter into call spread options on its common stock to limit exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the notes.
In connection with the call spread options, an affiliate of the initial purchaser is expected to take positions in our common stock in secondary market transactions and/or will enter into various derivative transactions on the notes. Such affiliate of the initial purchaser is likely to modify its hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of the company's common stock, other securities of the company or other instruments it may wish to use in connection with such hedging.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The securities will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.

LSI Logic Corporation (the "Registrant") currently anticipates that revenues for the second quarter of 2003 will increase by approximately 9 percent over revenues for the first quarter of 2003. The Registrant also announced a series of actions, completing the revamping of the company's global manufacturing strategy. These actions enable the acceleration of the final disposition of the Registrant's Tsukuba, Japan and Colorado Springs, Colorado manufacturing facilities. The Registrant anticipates reporting $140 million to $160 million in special items and expects a GAAP* net loss of 43-50 cents. On a pro forma basis, the Registrant's current expectation for net loss per share, excluding special items, is in the range of 6-8 cents.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Restructuring of operations and other items, net, are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Registrant's ongoing business.

LSI Logic anticipates that second quarter revenues will increase approximately 9 percent sequentially, near the high end of the previous growth guidance. LSI Logic also announced a series of actions, completing the revamping of the company's global manufacturing strategy. These steps enable the acceleration of the final disposition of LSI Logic's Tsukuba and Colorado Springs manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates reporting $140 million to $160 million in special items, compared to previous guidance of $50 million to $70 million in special items. LSI Logic expects a GAAP* net loss of 43-50 cents, compared to the earlier range of a net loss of 23-31 cents. On a pro forma basis, the company's second quarter net loss expectation (excluding special items**), improved by four cents to a range of 6-8 cents. The bottom line performance reflects better-than-expected gross margin expansion and accelerated benefits from the company's expense control and cost-reduction programs. "These actions focus our internal manufacturing on our world-class Gresham, Oregon campus," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "Going forward, LSI Logic will supplement its Gresham facility with foundry
engagements. Both will play key roles in the success of LSI Logic's RapidChip(TM), ASIC and standard product businesses." LSI Logic will report its second quarter 2003 financial results Wednesday, July 23 after the close of market. At that time, LSI Logic will provide guidance for the 2003 third quarter. * Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ** Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.

LSI LOGIC MOVES TOWARD PROFITABILITY IN SECOND HALF RAPIDCHIP(TM) PLATFORM DESIGN WINS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS MILPITAS, CALIFORNIA - LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported revenues of $407 million in the second quarter of 2003, a 9 percent sequential increase compared to the $373 million reported in the first quarter of 2003, and a decline of 7 percent compared to the $438 million reported in the second quarter of 2002. Cash and short-term investments increased $110 million to $1.1 billion at the end of the 2003-second quarter. The company generated positive operating cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. The 2003-second quarter GAAP* net loss was $162 million or 43 cents a diluted share. The 2003-first quarter GAAP net loss was $122 million or 33 cents a diluted share. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $62 million or 17 cents a diluted share in the 2002-second quarter. Second quarter net loss, excluding special items**, was $6 million or 2 cents a diluted share compared to first quarter net loss of $51 million or 14 cents a diluted share. The company reported a net loss, excluding special items, of $21 million or 6 cents a diluted share in the second quarter of 2002. "Each of our four businesses grew sequentially in the second quarter," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "Our Consumer business gained momentum in the second quarter, paving the way for a seasonally strong third quarter. Our Communications business was up strongly in the second quarter, particularly enterprise networking, and we expect further improvement in the second half of the year. Both of our storage businesses, Storage Components and Storage Systems, are expected to continue their growth ramps in the third quarter and the two businesses are anticipated to total about $1 billion in combined revenues for the year. "In the third quarter, we are forecasting sequential revenue growth in the 8-12 percent range, while maintaining our controls on operating expenses. We are on course to return to profitability in the third quarter, excluding special items, and in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis." In the second quarter, LSI Logic secured a wide variety of design wins with its RapidChip(TM) semiconductor platform, introduced the RapidWorx(TM) design
system, and this week unveiled two new families of IP-rich slices, the Rapid Xtreme(TM) and RapidChip Integrator(TM) slice families in 0.11-micron process technology. The RapidChip platform is demonstrating its broad market appeal as the company is capturing design wins in a range of sectors including: disk drives, encryption, embedded processing, broadband modems, and storage systems. "LSI Logic's RapidChip semiconductor platform is winning with our existing customers and is generating new business opportunities as evidenced by the fact that we are already exceeding our own design-win projections," said Rick Marz, LSI Logic executive vice president of ASIC Technology. "This Platform ASIC approach is providing greater customer choice and is specifically designed to meet the design-time and cost requirements of the underserved middle of the global logic market." "LSI Logic's projected move to profitability in the second half of the year reflects the impact of revenue growth and the actions the company has taken to reduce its break-even points," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "LSI Logic has completed its restructuring program, including the consolidation of its internal manufacturing at the company's Gresham manufacturing campus, supplemented by strategic foundry engagements. We made substantial progress in the second quarter toward our three key financial initiatives for 2003 - accelerating the return to profitability, generating positive operating cash flow, and making R&D investments that will provide us with leadership positions in our target markets." LSI LOGIC THIRD QUARTER BUSINESS OUTLOOK Common stock equivalents are excluded from share count in loss periods as a result of their anti-dilutive effect.
Capital spending is projected to be under $30 million in the third quarter, and less than $100 million in 2003. Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $46 million. * Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ** Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.

"LSI Logic's double-digit top-line growth was paced by our Consumer business, which demonstrated seasonal third-quarter strength," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "In Communications, our Enterprise Networking business is expected to continue its gradual growth pattern in the fourth quarter, while the WAN market remains under pressure. Our Storage Systems business is expanding and we anticipate strong sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Storage Components recorded key Ultra320 SCSI and RAID design wins in the third quarter and is gathering momentum for the fourth quarter. Combined, our two storage businesses are anticipated to contribute more than $1 billion in revenues this year.
"In the fourth quarter, we are forecasting 0-2% revenue growth and net income of 3-5 cents per share, excluding special items, and a break-even to a modest net loss on a GAAP basis. Our continuing R&D investments, our flexible
 
 
manufacturing strategy and our strong cash balance have all enhanced LSI Logic's competitive position heading into the projected industry upturn in 2004."
"LSI Logic's first RapidChip platform products are scheduled for shipment in the fourth quarter," said Rick Marz, LSI Logic executive vice president of ASIC Technology. "We are confident that our cost sensitive, fast time-to-market RapidChip platform provides us with a significant competitive advantage in the strategic and growing global Platform ASIC market."
Last month, LSI Logic signed a definitive agreement to sell the company's Tsukuba, Japan manufacturing facility and extend its foundry usage. The transaction is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. When this action is finalized, LSI Logic will have completed the consolidation of its internal manufacturing at the company's Gresham campus, supplemented by strategic foundry engagements.
"During the third quarter, LSI Logic made further strides towards achieving GAAP profitability, generated positive operating cash flow for the sixth straight quarter, reduced operating expenses, eliminated all current debt and maintained nearly $1 billion in cash and short-term investments," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "As a result of all of these actions, we have increased LSI Logic's financial strength and strategic positioning in the global marketplace."
Common stock equivalents are excluded from share count in loss periods as a result of their anti-dilutive effect.
Capital spending is projected to be around $25 million in the fourth quarter, and less than $75 million in 2003.
 
 
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization are expected to be approximately $37 million.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported 2003 fourth quarter revenues of $463 million, a 3 percent increase compared to the $450 million reported in the third quarter of 2003, and a decline of 4 percent compared to the $480 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Milpitas, California 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $814 million at the end of the 2003-fourth quarter. The company generated positive operating cash flow for the seventh consecutive quarter and repurchased approximately $250 million in convertible notes, eliminating all 2005 debt. In the third quarter, LSI Logic extinguished all 2004 debt.
The 2003-fourth quarter GAAP* net income was $8 million or 2 cents per diluted share. The 2003-third quarter GAAP net loss was $32 million or 8 cents per diluted share. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $31 million or 8 cents per diluted share in the 2002-fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter net income, excluding special items**, was $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share compared to a third quarter net income, excluding special items, of $17 million or 4 cents per diluted share. The company reported net income, excluding special items, of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
"Strength in Storage Systems, Storage Components, and Communications more than offset the weakness in the video-game sector in Q4," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "In the fourth quarter, the sequential revenue growth of our Storage Systems business reflected the continued movement by OEMs toward scalable, modular storage systems. Storage Components demonstrated strength, driven by increased demand for servers, migration to Ultra320 SCSI controllers, and growth of the global SAN market. Our Communications business continued to show signs of improvement as a result of renewed IT spending and growing broadband acceptance. Our Consumer business exhibited traditional fourth quarter seasonality, partially offset by robust design-win and sales activities for our single-chip architectures for high-definition products and DVD-recorders.
 
"The worldwide economy and the global IT industry are both improving, particularly in the U.S. and Asia. The global semiconductor industry is projected by market analysts to grow by 20 percent or more. LSI Logic is confident that it is well positioned to capitalize on this favorable business environment."
Last November, LSI Logic announced its intention to create a separate company based on its wholly owned subsidiary, LSI Logic Storage Systems, Inc. Please refer to the company's November 13, 2003 news release for further information concerning the separation.
During the fourth quarter, LSI Logic finalized its sale of the company's Tsukuba, Japan manufacturing facility to Rohm Co. LSI Logic has now completed the consolidation of its internal manufacturing at the company's Gresham, Oregon campus, supplemented by strategic foundry relationships.
LSI Logic recorded 2003 revenues of $1.69 billion, a 7 percent decrease from the $1.82 billion in 2002. The GAAP 2003 net loss was $309 million or 82 cents per diluted share compared to the GAAP 2002 net loss of $292 million or 79 cents per diluted share. LSI Logic recorded a 2003 net loss, excluding special items, of $16 million or 4 cents per diluted share, compared to a 2002 net loss, excluding special items, of $42 million or 11 cents a diluted share. The company generated $190 million in cash from operations in 2003, a 15 percent increase over the previous year.
"We shipped our first RapidChip platform products in the fourth quarter. We have now recorded Platform ASIC design wins with existing and new customers based in all major semiconductor consuming regions including North America, Europe, Japan and China," said Joe Zelayeta, LSI Logic executive vice president of ASIC Technology and Methodology. "As the global semiconductor market gathers momentum, we anticipate an acceleration of our RapidChip design-win activity, strengthening LSI Logic's leadership position in the growing Platform ASIC space."
"In the fourth quarter, LSI Logic achieved its profitability goal on both a GAAP and excluding special items basis, and generated positive operating
 
cash flow for the seventh straight quarter," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "We also used our strong cash position to reduce overall debt by more than $360 million in 2003. We are executing our financial plan and we are looking forward to a period of sustained growth and financial strength."
Common stock equivalents are excluded from share count in loss periods as a result of their anti-dilutive effect.
Capital spending is projected to be around $25 million in the first quarter, and approximately $100 million in 2004.
First quarter depreciation and software amortization are expected to be approximately $32 million.
*   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
**   Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.

Exhibit 99.1
CC04-34
LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) took another step today toward the separation of its storage systems business from its semiconductor, storage adapters and associated software businesses with the filing by its subsidiary, LSI Logic Storage Systems, Inc., of a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing provides for an offering by the storage systems subsidiary of up to $250 million of its common stock.
MILPITAS, CA 
In the S-1 filing, LSI Logic reaffirmed its intention to pursue the separation of its wholly owned subsidiary into an independent public company providing modular, high-performance, disk storage systems and sub-assemblies primarily to server and storage original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
The initial public offering (IPO) of the storage systems company is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2004. At the completion of the offering, LSI Logic will continue to own the majority of the outstanding common stock of the storage systems company. LSI Logic's current
 
intention is to distribute to its stockholders by summer of 2005 the remaining shares of the storage systems company owned by LSI Logic in a tax-free transaction. All of the net proceeds from the storage systems company's IPO are expected to be paid to LSI Logic.
After the separation, LSI Logic's strategic focus will be on its semiconductor businesses targeted at global Consumer, Communications and Storage Components markets. Included in these LSI Logic businesses are standard-cell ASICs, RapidChip Platform ASICs, standard products, host bus adapters and internal RAID adapters.
The offering will only be made by means of a prospectus. When available, a copy of the preliminary prospectus may be obtained from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Attn: Prospectus Department, 1585 Broadway, New York, NY 10036-8200, or from Goldman, Sachs & Co., Attn: Prospectus Department, 85 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004-2408.
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
 
This news release contains a number of forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the following: LSI Logic's intention to separate its storage systems business from its semiconductor business and to create a separate storage systems company; the anticipated payment of the IPO proceeds to LSI Logic; the possibility of completing the IPO for the storage systems company in the first half of 2004; and the possibility of distributing the remaining shares of the storage systems company in a tax-free transaction or selling or holding a portion of the shares of the storage system company. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the possibility that the semiconductor company's financial results will be harmed as a result of the separation of the storage systems business; the increased vulnerability of each company to the cyclical nature of each of their respective industries; increased expenses resulting from the separation; employee distraction and the inability of LSI Logic to manage successfully and complete the separation, including the ability to retain and attract key employees; risks relating to the allocation of assets and personnel between the companies; the risk that the IPO for the storage systems company may not occur; the risk of a downturn in the companies' target markets; the possibility of unfavorable economic conditions in general; and to the extent that the spin-off of the storage systems company occurs, the risk that the ability of the holders of LSI Logic's convertible notes to proceed against the full assets of LSI Logic might be impaired. In addition, please see the documents filed by LSI Logic with the SEC, and specifically its most recent reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, for more complete description of the risks and uncertainties facing LSI Logic's business. LSI Logic undertakes no duty to update the forward-looking statements herein.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported 2004 first quarter revenues of $452 million, an increase of 21 percent compared to the $373 million reported in the first quarter of 2003 and a 2 percent seasonal decrease compared to the $463 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Milpitas, California 
Cash and short-term investments increased $44 million and totaled $858 million at the end of the first quarter of 2004. The company generated positive operating cash flow for the eighth consecutive quarter.
The 2004 first quarter GAAP* net income was $9 million or 2 cents per diluted share compared to a GAAP net loss of $122 million or 33 cents per diluted share in the 2003 first quarter.
The 2004 first quarter GAAP net income reflected a sequential improvement over the 2003 fourth quarter GAAP net income of $8 million or 2 cents per diluted share.
First quarter 2004 net income, excluding special items**, was $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share compared to a net loss on the same basis, of $51 million or 14 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003.
Excluding special items**, the 2004 first quarter net income equaled fourth quarter 2003 net income on the same basis, of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share on seasonally lower revenues.
"LSI Logic's Storage Components business, which includes Storage ASICs, Storage Standard Products and RAID Storage Adapters, recorded a solid performance in the first quarter," said Wilfred Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "The first quarter results for our Storage Systems business reflected normal cyclicality. In Communications, LSI Logic's sales to enterprise networking customers continued to demonstrate improvement, while telecommunications is expected to resume its long-term growth rate later this year. In Consumer, video game revenues declined seasonally as expected. However, our DVD-recordable business continued to increase sequentially as we secure new design-wins for our single chip architecture.
"Market analysts expect that 2004 will be a strong year for the semiconductor sector based upon increased IT spending and consumer electronics serving as the industry's primary growth driver. LSI Logic is focused on three target markets  Consumer, Communications, Storage  and serves customers in these markets with our three enabling technologies  Standard-Cell ASICs, Platform ASICs and Standard Products."
In February, LSI Logic's wholly owned subsidiary, LSI Logic Storage Systems, Inc., filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Please refer to the company's February 19, 2004 news release for further information about the filing of the registration statement. http://www.lsilogic.com/news/news_archives.html?ArcYear=2004
 
"Platform ASIC is emerging as a major new sector in the semiconductor industry," said Joe Zelayeta, LSI Logic executive vice president of ASIC Technology and Methodology. "The lower design costs, quick time to revenue advantages and compelling benefits over alternative solutions are proving to be a significant draw for both existing LSI Logic customers as well as new customers. LSI Logic's RapidChip Platform ASIC is now well established in this sector. We are shipping production now and have design engagements that span geographies, markets and applications. We continue to capture design wins on the approximately 25 silicon platforms that we have available today and are constantly releasing new platforms to garner greater market share."
"LSI Logic recorded a solid profitable quarter with continued improvement in gross margin and bottom line results that exceeded expectations," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "LSI Logic generated positive operating cash flow for the eighth straight quarter and completed the acquisitions of Velio Communications and Crosslayer Networks. We will continue to explore strategic acquisitions that support our vertical market strategy, augment our IP portfolio and expand our product offerings for our worldwide customer base."
Capital spending is projected to be around $25 million in the second quarter, and approximately $100 million in 2004.
Second quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $26 million.
NOTE: The company's financial guidance will be limited to the comments made on today's public conference call and contained in the Second Quarter Business Outlook section of this news release.

Item 5. Other Items and Regulation FD Disclosure
LSI Logic Corporation ("LSI Logic" or the "Registrant") issued a press release stating that it expected to report consolidated revenues of approximately $448 million in the second quarter of 2004, a 10% increase over second quarter 2003 results. The Registrant earlier forecasted second quarter revenues in the range of $455 million to $470 million. LSI Logic updated its 2004-second quarter revenue projections due primarily to softer-than-anticipated demand for semiconductors in storage components and video game console markets.
LSI Logic anticipates that its second quarter earnings per share will be in the range of 1-3 cents per diluted share on a GAAP basis, consistent with previous guidance. LSI Logic anticipates that its second quarter gross margin will be approximately 46 percent, compared to the previous guidance of 45-46 percent.
LSI Logic operates in two reportable segments: semiconductors and storage systems. LSI Logic expects to report approximately $336 million in second quarter semiconductor segment revenues. Second quarter storage systems revenues are anticipated to be about $112 million, which excludes approximately $1 million in inter-company sales to the semiconductor segment.

This filing and the news release include preliminary financial estimates and forward-looking statements, which include the following: the company's preliminary estimates of revenues, earnings per share and gross margin for the second quarter of 2004; forecasts of positive growth for the global semiconductor industry in 2004; and the anticipation that the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half of the year. These forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the time the statements are made and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI Logic's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: receipt of more detailed information about the company's second quarter results; further analysis of revenues and expenses for the second quarter; the strength of the global semiconductor industry; and the timing and volumes of customer demand.

Editor's Notes:
 
Statements of operations excluding special items are intended to present the Company's operating results, excluding special items described below, for the periods presented.
During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004, the special items represented amortization of acquisition related items including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and other special items. The other special items consisted of gains on certain equity securities, offset in part by fees related to the initial public offering and our separation from Engenio.
During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2003, the special items represented amortization of acquisition related items including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and other special items. The other special items consisted of losses associated with repurchases of a portion of the Company's Convertible Subordinated Notes, write downs of certain equity securities due to impairment, offset in part by gains on miscellaneous asset sales.
For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004, the statements excluding special items are prepared using the Company's calculated tax expense of $6,000 and $12,000, respectively when excluding special items. For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2003, the statements excluding special items are prepared using the Company's calculated tax expense of $6,000 and $12,000, respectively when excluding special items.
For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004, 5,064 and 6,531 shares, respectively were considered dilutive common stock equivalents and included in the computation of diluted earnings per share excluding special items. In computing diluted loss per share excluding special items for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2003, common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as a result of their antidilutive effect.
A reconciliation from net income/(loss) excluding special items to the reported results is presented on the following page.
The format presented above is not intended to be in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.
     2.8 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the chairman of the board, or (b) in the absence thereof, such person as the chairman of the board of directors shall appoint, or (c) in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the board shall fail to make such appointment, such person as the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall appoint or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors. In the absence of the corporate secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
     The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
     2.9 VOTING
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
 
     Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates' names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as he may see fit.
     2.10 WAIVER OF NOTICE
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     2.11 STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
     2.12 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
          (a) Actions other than Written Consent. For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors may, at any time within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)). If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.
 
For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
     2.13 PROXIES
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.14 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
     The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 
     2.15 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
     Such inspector(s) shall:
          (a) Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
          (b) Receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) Count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          (e) Determine when the polls shall close;
          (f) Determine the result; and
          (g) Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
     2.16 NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS
          (a) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at any meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these by-laws, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
          (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before a stockholders meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 2.16(a), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the corporate secretary of the corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the corporate secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than ninety (90) calendar days before the anniversary of the date that the corporation's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date
provided, however
 
of the prior year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any successor thereto) and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (or any successor thereto) (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
     3.1 POWERS
     Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
     3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
     Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock of the corporation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
 
     3.3 ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
     Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these by-laws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
     Election of directors need not be by written ballot.
     3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
     Any director may resign at any time upon written notice or upon electronic transmission to the attention of the corporate secretary of the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws:
          (a) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
          (b) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
     If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board ( as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as
 
aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
     3.5 PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE
     The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
     3.6 REGULAR MEETINGS
     Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
     3.7 SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE
     Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, a majority of the board of directors, the president or the chief executive officer.
     Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be: (a) delivered personally or orally by telephone or sent by overnight or courier service, facsimile transmission or other form of electronic transmission (such as email), addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting; or (b) sent by first class mail, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat.
     3.8 QUORUM
     At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
 
     A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
     3.9 WAIVER OF NOTICE
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need to specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     3.10 BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
     3.11 FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.
     3.12 REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
     Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that, so long as shareholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
 
     4.1 COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS
     The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in the by-laws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend the by-laws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the by-laws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Executive officers of the corporation shall only be those officers expressly designated as such by the board of directors.

     Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice or by sending an electronic transmission to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or transmission or at any later time specified in that notice or transmission; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice or transmission, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.

     The chairman of the board, the president, chief executive officer, any vice president, the treasurer, the corporate secretary or assistant corporate secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president, or the chief executive officer or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation.

     6.1 THIRD PARTY ACTIONS
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "") (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (collectively ""), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.

Agent
     6.2 ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
 
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     6.3 SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE
     To the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     6.4 DETERMINATION OF CONDUCT
     Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, of if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
 
     6.5 RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
     If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending an Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
     6.6 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Agent who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Agent, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Agent's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Agent's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
     6.7 INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to
 
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity in another capacity while holding such office.
     6.8 INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION
     The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

     Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder.

     The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these by-laws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
     8.3 STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES
     The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     8.4 SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
 
powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
     8.5 LOST CERTIFICATES

The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

     The by-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.

Exhibit 99.1
CC04-114
 LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today updated its 2004-third quarter projections for revenue, earnings per share and gross margin, prompted by customer reassessment of end-demand for the second half of the year, resulting in a broad-based Q3 inventory correction in the supply chain.
MILPITAS, CA
LSI Logic expects to report revenues in the range of $370 million to $400 million. The company previously forecasted third quarter revenues in the range of $435 million to $465 million.
LSI Logic anticipates a third quarter GAAP* net loss in the range of 14-17 cents per diluted share. The company previously projected third quarter GAAP results in the range of breakeven to a net loss of 3 cents per diluted share.
 
The company expects a third quarter net loss, excluding special items**, in the range of 4-7 cents per diluted share. The company previously forecasted third quarter net income, excluding special items, in the range of 3-6 cents per diluted share.
LSI Logic anticipates that its third quarter gross margin will be approximately 42-44 percent, compared to the previous guidance of 44-46 percent.
"We have seen a broad-based build of inventory in the supply chain starting in the second quarter, which impacted each of our semiconductor business units in the third quarter," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "As the inventory is worked down, we anticipate positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
"Long term, we have built technology leadership positions in DVD recorder, high definition video, Fibre Channel, SAS, SATA, RAID controllers and other applications. Design wins and product shipments of our RapidChip Platform ASIC continue to increase, leading to volume production in 2005."
LSI Logic will not hold a conference call today about this news release. The company will report its 2004-third quarter financial results, provide its fourth quarter business outlook and hold its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, October 27, 2004.

Table of Contents
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 27, 2004, LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company" or "LSI Logic") notified the required parties of its intention to exercise its early buyout right to purchase all of the Equipment as defined below under two lease and security agreements each dated as of August 6, 2004. The first lease and security agreement ("Lease A") is among Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association as agent, the Company as lessee and BTM Capital Corporation as lessor. The second lease and security agreement ("Lease B") is among Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association as agent, the Company as lessee and Bank of the West as lessor. The date on which such purchase is to occur under each Lease is November 29, 2004.
Lease A and Lease B are for wafer fabrication equipment (the "Equipment") that was previously on lease immediately prior to the notification as described above. At lease inception, Lease A was for $201 million and Lease B was for $134 million for a total of $335 million. The leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and are for a term of three years. The Company could, at the end of the lease term, return or purchase, at a pre-determined amount, all of the Equipment. The Company has posted $311 million of cash as collateral for the leases as of September 30, 2004. The Company is required to maintain unrestricted cash and short-term investment reserves in an amount no less than the higher of a) the sum of $100 million plus the principal amount of the Company's 2001 Convertible Subordinated Notes due in 2006 or b) $350 million. The Company was in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2004. The early termination or buyout amount under Lease A is $199 million and the buyout amount under Lease B is $133 million for a total of $332 million, which the Company expects to occur on November 29, 2004. Termination fees under the lease agreements are not considered to be material.
The Company guarantees residual values related to the leased Equipment. The total exposure to residual value guarantees is approximately $141 million as of September 30, 2004. The Company concluded that exposure related to residual value guarantees existed in connection with the conclusion that the Gresham manufacturing facility was impaired as discussed in Item 2.06 below, which discussion is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 27, 2004, the Company issued a news release regarding its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004*. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three- and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2004 and 2003*, provides useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as it excludes charges, expenses, gains and losses that are not directly related to the ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2004 and 2003*, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Results of operations excluding special items for the period presented are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.

Item 2.04 Triggering Events that Accelerate or Increase under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
On October 27, 2004, the Company notified the required parties as described in Item 1.02, of its intention to exercise its early buyout right to purchase the Equipment under Lease A and Lease B, as described in Item 1.02. The buyout amount under Lease A is $199 million and the buyout amount under Lease B is $133 million for a total of $332 million, which the Company expects to occur on November 29, 2004. The information under Item 1.02 is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
In order to realign expenditures with current revenue expectations, the Company announced a worldwide reduction in workforce on October 27, 2004. The Company recorded approximately $14 million in charges for severance and termination benefits for approximately 510 positions for the three months ended September 30, 2004. The Company accrued for the severance and related benefits in the third quarter of 2004 in accordance with the guidance of SFAS No. 112 " Employers' Accounting for Post Employment benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43". The date of commitment to this course of action was October 27, 2004 upon approval by the Company's Board of Directors. The majority of the severance and termination benefits will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments
As a result of the decline in revenues in the semiconductor industry and in the Company's projected outlook in the latter part of the third quarter of 2004, the Company concluded in accordance with SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", that the Gresham manufacturing facility was impaired. The conclusion was reached on October 27, 2004 upon the finalization of valuation studies that had been performed and discussions with the Company's Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company recorded $206 million in impairment charges for the Gresham facility for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and estimates it will record approximately $177 million in impairment charges for the three months ending December 31, 2004. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 will reflect the impairment of the equipment that will be purchased in connection with the termination of the operating leases as described in Item 1.02. The impairment charges will be non-cash charges. The fourth quarter cash flows will reflect the buyout of both leases, net of the return of cash collateral associated with the leases, as discussed in Item 1.02 of this Form 8-K.
Item 8.01 Other Events
The Company reported revenues of $380 million in the third quarter of 2004, a 16 percent decrease compared to the $450 million reported in the third quarter of 2003, and a 15 percent sequential decrease compared to the $448 million reported in the second quarter of 2004.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $809 million at the end of the third quarter of 2004. The Company repurchased approximately $69 million in convertible notes, reducing the Company's debt due in 2006.
Third quarter 2004 net loss was $282 million or 73 cents per diluted share, including a $206 million non-cash charge for Gresham manufacturing facility impairment. The third quarter result compares to a net loss of $32 million or 8 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. Second quarter 2004 net income was $7 million or 2 cents per diluted share. The foregoing net loss and net income figures were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Exhibit 99.1
 
LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported 2004 third quarter revenues of $380 million, a decrease of 16 percent compared to the $450 million reported in the third quarter of 2003, and a 15 percent sequential decrease compared to the $448 million reported in the second quarter of 2004.
Milpitas, California 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $809 million at the end of the third quarter of 2004. LSI Logic generated positive operating cash flow for the 10th consecutive quarter and repurchased approximately $69 million in convertible notes, reducing the company's debt due in 2006.
Third quarter 2004 GAAP* net loss was $282 million or 73 cents per diluted share, including a $206 million non-cash charge for Gresham manufacturing facility impairment. The third quarter GAAP result compares to a GAAP net loss of $32 million or 8 cents per diluted share in the 2003 third quarter. Second quarter 2004 GAAP net income was $7 million or 2 cents per diluted share.
Third quarter 2004 net loss, excluding special items**, was $25 million or 7 cents per diluted share compared to net income, excluding special items, of $17 million or 4 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding special items, second quarter 2004 net income was $28 million or 7 cents per diluted share.
"The wave of third-quarter pre-announcements throughout the global semiconductor industry reflected customer end-demand reassessments and the ongoing industrywide effort to work down excess supply chain inventory by the end of the year," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "We have taken proactive steps to realign our R&D and SG&A expenses to our current revenue expectations, including a difficult but necessary 11 percent reduction in force.
"In Consumer, our revenues grew, but at a lower rate than originally projected as retail sales reflected softer consumer demand. Both our Communications and Storage Components businesses are being impacted by slower than expected IT spending by enterprises.
"In Storage Components, we are optimistic that excess inventory will be worked down in the fourth quarter. We are projecting that our anticipated 2005 growth in this segment will be driven by our technology leadership positions in Fibre Channel, SAS, SATA, RAID controllers and other applications.
"Revenues for our Engenio Information Technologies, Inc. storage systems subsidiary were down sequentially from the second to the third quarter as a result of a customer inventory adjustment. Earlier this week, Engenio broadened its OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems to provide Sun with new modular storage technology and to co-develop technology for future Sun storage products."
 
"Customer interest in our RapidChip Platform ASIC accelerated in the third quarter with a corresponding increase in our design-win rate," said Joe Zelayeta, LSI Logic executive vice president of ASIC Technology and Methodology. "This heightened level of sales activity is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, as we have introduced the RapidWorx 3.0 suite of design tools and validated the time-to-revenue value of the product by shipping working silicon to customers in as little as three months."
"LSI Logic is taking action to improve operating expenses and cost of sales, while aligning our R&D investments to the most attractive business opportunities," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "We continue to generate positive operating cash flow and moved to a net positive cash-to-debt position during the third quarter. We are improving our cost structure, reducing debt and targeting profitable revenue growth in the coming year."
 LSI Logic's estimated fourth quarter GAAP results include an anticipated $177 million non-cash charge for Gresham manufacturing facility impairment.
Capital spending is projected to be around $40 million in the fourth quarter, and approximately $80 million in total for 2004.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $23 million.
NOTE: The company's financial guidance will be limited to the comments made on today's public conference call and contained in the Fourth Quarter Business Outlook section of this news release.

Editor's Notes:
 
 
 
Statements of operations excluding special items are intended to present the Company's operating results, excluding special items described below, for the periods presented.
During the three month period ended September 30, 2004, the special items represented amortization of acquisition related items including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and other special items. The other special items consisted of write-downs of certain equity securities due to impairment and fees related to our subsidiary Engenio's initial public offering, which was postponed in August of 2004 due to market conditions. These charges were offset in part by gains associated with the repurchase of a portion of the Company's Convertible Subordinated Notes.
During the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, the special items represented all the items mentioned above in addition to gains on certain equity securities.
During the three month period ended September 30, 2003, the special items represented amortization of acquisition related items including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and other special items. The other special items consisted of losses associated with the repurchase of a portion of the Company's Convertible Subordinated Notes and losses on miscellaneous assets sales. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2003, the special items represented all the items mentioned above in addition to write downs on certain equity securities due to impairment, offset in part by gains on miscellaneous asset sales.
For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004, the statements excluding special items are prepared using the Company's calculated tax expense of $6,000 and $18,000, respectively when excluding special items. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003, the statements excluding special items are prepared using the Company's calculated tax expense of $6,000 and $18,000, respectively when excluding special items.
For the three month period ended September 30, 2004, all common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as a result of their antidilutive effect. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, 4,964 shares were considered dilutive common stock equivalents and included in the computation of diluted earning per share excluding special items.
For the three month period ended September 30, 2003, 8,213 shares were considered dilutive common stock equivalents and included in the computation of diluted earnings per share excluding special items. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2003, all common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as a result of their antidilutive effect.
A reconciliation from net (loss)/income excluding special items to the reported results is presented on the following page.
The format presented above is not intended to be in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Each Nonemployee Director who first becomes a Nonemployee Director on or after the effective date of this Plan, automatically shall receive, as of the date that the individual first is appointed or elected as a Nonemployee Director, 2,500 Shares of Restricted Stock.
     10.2 Terms of Restricted Stock.
          10.2.1 Award Agreement. Each Award of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Section 10 shall be evidenced by a written Award Agreement between the Participant and the Company.
          10.2.2 Escrow. Shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Section 10 shall be held by the Company as escrow agent until the end of the Period of Restriction applicable to such Shares.
          10.2.3 End of Period of Restriction. The Period of Restriction for each Award of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to Section 10.1 shall end as to 100% of the Shares on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and all such Shares shall be fully vested on such date. Notwithstanding the preceding, once a Participant ceases to be a Director, his or her Shares of Restricted Stock as to which the Period of Restriction has not ended shall be immediately forfeited, except to the limited extent provided in Section 10.2.5.
          10.2.4 Death of Participant. If a Participant dies prior to the end of the Period of Restriction on his or her Award of Restricted Stock in accordance with Section 10.2.3, then the Period of Restriction applicable to such Award shall immediately end and one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares covered by his or her Award of Restricted Stock shall immediately become one hundred percent (100%) vested.
          10.2.5 Other Terms. All provisions of the Plan not inconsistent with this Section 10 shall apply to Awards of Restricted Stock granted to Nonemployee Directors.
     11.1 Deferrals. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award. Any such deferral elections shall be subject to such rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
     11.2 No Effect on Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment or service at any time, with or without cause. For purposes of the Plan, transfer of employment of a Participant between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Service. Employment with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-will basis only.
 
     11.3 Participation. No Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.
     11.4 Indemnification. Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan or any Award Agreement, and (b) from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
     11.5 Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan, with respect to Awards granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company.
     11.6 Limited Transferability of Awards. No Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to an Award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Plan becomes effective, the Committee (in its sole discretion) may determine that a Participant may, in a manner specified by the Committee, (a) transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option to a Participant's spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-approved domestic relations order which relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights, and (b) transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option by bona fide gift and not for any consideration, to (i) a member or members of the Participant's immediate family, (ii) a trust established for the exclusive benefit of the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participant's immediate family, (iii) a partnership, limited liability company of other entity whose only partners or members are the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participant's immediate family, or (iv) a foundation in which the Participant an/or member(s) of the Participant's immediate family control the management of the foundation's assets. The transferability provisions provided in the preceding sentence shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee after the effective date of the Plan.
     11.7 Beneficiary Designations. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Section 11.6, after the Plan becomes effective, the Committee (in its sole discretion) may determine that a Participant under the Plan may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner
 
acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate and, subject to the terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement, any unexercised vested Award may be exercised by the administrator or executor of the Participant's estate. The provisions of this Section 11.7 shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee after the effective date of the Plan.
     11.8 No Rights as Stockholder. Except to the limited extent provided in Sections 6.6 and 6.7 with respect to holders of Restricted Stock, no Participant (nor any beneficiary) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or beneficiary).
     12.1 Amendment, Suspension, or Termination. The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. The amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant. No Award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan.
     12.2 Duration of the Plan. The Plan shall be effective as of February 12, 2004, and subject to Section 12.1 (regarding the Board's right to amend or terminate the Plan), shall remain in effect thereafter. However, without further stockholder approval, no Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after February 12, 2014.
     13.1 Withholding Requirements. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof).
     13.2 Withholding Arrangements. The Committee, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (a) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, or (b) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld.
 
     13.3 Minimum Share Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any Shares issued pursuant to an Award hereunder, the purchase price by a Participant for each Share issued shall in no event be less than the par value per Share; provided, however, the Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that any such purchase price shall be paid by the Company to a Participant pursuant to a bonus equal to the aggregate purchase price for such Shares, subject to required tax withholding.
     14.1 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.
     14.2 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
     14.3 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
     14.4 Securities Law Compliance. With respect to Section 16 Persons, transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3. To the extent any provision of the Plan, Award Agreement or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.
     14.5 Governing Law. The Plan and all Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of California, other than its conflicts of laws provisions.
     14.6 Captions. Captions are provided herein for convenience only, and shall not serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of the Plan.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, by its duly authorized officer, has executed this restated Plan on the date indicated below.

 
Exhibit 10.2
     Engenio Information Technologies, Inc. (formerly LSI Logic Storage Systems, Inc.) (the "Company") hereby grants you (the "Employee"), a nonqualified stock option under the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), to purchase shares of Class A common stock of the Company ("Shares") effective as of the date (the "Grant Date") indicated on the Notice of Grant of Stock Options (the "Notice of Grant") to which this agreement is attached and which are collectively referred to as the "Agreement". In general, the latest date this option will expire is the expiration date indicated on the Notice of Grant (the "Expiration Date"). However, as provided in this Agreement, this option may expire earlier than the Expiration Date. Subject to the provisions of the Notice of Grant, this Agreement and of the Plan, the principal features of this option are as follows:
Your signature to the Notice of Grant indicates your agreement and understanding that this grant is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in the Notice of Grant, this Agreement and the Plan. For example, important additional information on vesting and forfeiture of the Shares covered by this grant is contained in the Notice of Grant. PLEASE BE SURE TO READ ALL OF THE NOTICE OF GRANT, WHICH CONTAINS CERTAIN SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS OPTION.
          1. Grant of Option. The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan, as a separate incentive in connection with his or her employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for his or her services, a nonqualified stock option to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, all or any part of an aggregate of the number of Shares listed in the Notice of Grant.
          2. Exercise Price. The purchase price per Share for this option (the "Exercise Price") shall be the option price listed in the Notice of Grant.
          3. Vesting Schedule. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 14 of this Agreement, the right to exercise this option will vest as to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares subject to the option on the first anniversary date of the Vesting Commencement Date, and as to an additional 25% on each subsequent anniversary date of the Vesting Commencement Date thereafter, until the right to exercise this option shall have vested with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of such Shares. Shares scheduled to vest on any such date actually will vest only if the Employee has not incurred a Termination of Service prior to such date.
          4. Termination of Option. In the event of the Employee's Termination of Service for any reason other than Disability or death, the Employee may, within three (3) months after the date of such Termination of Service, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any then vested but unexercised portion of this option. In the event of the Employee's Termination of Service due to Disability, the Employee may, within one (1) year after the date of Termination of Service due to Disability, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any then vested but unexercised portion of this option. In addition, this option may terminate in accordance with Paragraph 13.
          5. Death of Employee. In the event that the Employee dies while in the employ of the Company and/or an Affiliate or during the three (3) month or one (1) year periods referred to in Paragraph 4 above, the Employee's designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives the Employee, the administrator or executor of the Employee's estate (the "Transferee"), may, within one (1) year after the date of death, exercise any unexercised portion of the option that was vested prior to the Employee's Termination of Service. Any such Transferee must furnish the Company (a) written notice of his or her status as a Transferee, (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer of this option and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to such transfer, and (c) written acceptance of the terms and conditions of this option as set forth in this Agreement.
 
          6. Persons Eligible to Exercise Option. Except as provided in Paragraph 5 above or as otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, this option shall be exercisable during the Employee's lifetime only by the Employee.
          7. Option is Not Transferable. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this option and the rights and privileges conferred hereby may not be transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, pledge, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this option, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this option and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately shall become null and void.
          8. Exercise of Option. This option may be exercised by the person then entitled to do so as to any Shares which may then be purchased (a) by giving notice of exercise by way of such form, time, place and/or manner as the Company may designate, (b) providing full payment of the Exercise Price (and the amount of any income tax the Company determines is required to be withheld by reason of the exercise of this option or as is otherwise required under Paragraph 10 below), and (c) giving satisfactory assurances in the form or manner requested by the Company that the shares to be purchased upon the exercise of this option are being purchased for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if the expiration date of this option falls on a Saturday, Sunday or California holiday, the Employee may exercise any then vested but unexercised portion of this option at any time prior to the close of business on the first business day following that Saturday, Sunday or California holiday. In addition, if the option is to be exercised through a stock broker-assisted transaction, the option must be exercised while the applicable stock market is open for trading and before the option otherwise expires.
          9. Conditions to Exercise. Except as provided in Paragraph 8 above or as otherwise required as a matter of law, and as so specified by the Company at any time, the Exercise Price for this option may be paid in one (1) (or a combination of two (2) or more) of the following forms:
          (a) Personal check, a cashier's check or a money order.
          (b) Irrevocable directions to a securities broker approved by the Company to sell all or part of the option shares and to deliver to the Company from the sale proceeds an amount sufficient to pay the Exercise Price and any required withholding taxes. (The balance of the sale proceeds, if any, will be delivered to Employee.)
          (c) Irrevocable directions to a securities broker or lender approved by the Company to pledge option shares as security for a loan and to deliver to the Company from the loan proceeds an amount sufficient to pay the Exercise Price and any required withholding taxes.
          10. Tax Withholding and Payment Obligations. The Company will assess its requirements regarding tax, social insurance and any other payroll tax withholding and reporting in connection with this option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of this option or sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of this option ("tax-related items"). These requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change. Regardless of the Company's actions in this regard, the Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any and all tax-related items is and remains his or her responsibility and liability and that the Company (1) makes no representations or undertaking regarding treatment of any tax-related items in connection with any aspect of this option grant, including the grant, vesting or exercise of this option and the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of this option; and (2) does not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of this option to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability regarding tax-related items. In the event the Company determines that it and/or an Affiliate must withhold or collect any tax-related items as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan, the Employee agrees as a condition of the grant of this option to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to enable it to satisfy all withholding and/or collection requirements. The Employee authorizes the Company and/or an Affiliate to withhold all applicable withholding taxes from the Employee's wages. Furthermore, the Employee agrees to pay the Company and/or an Affiliate any amount of taxes the Company and/or an Affiliate may be required to withhold or collect as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by deduction from the Employee's wages or other cash compensation paid to the Employee by the
 
Company and/or an Affiliate. The Employee acknowledges that he or she may not exercise this option unless the tax withholding and/or collection obligations of the Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied.
          11. Suspension of Exercisability. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition of the purchase of Shares hereunder, this option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.
          12. Lock-Up Period. The Employee shall not offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Shares (or other securities) of the Company or enter into any swap, hedging or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Shares (or other securities) of the Company held by the Employee (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters of the Shares (or other securities) of the Company not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Employee shall execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the underwriter which are consistent with the foregoing or which are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or the representative of the underwriters of the Shares (or other securities) of the Company, the Employee shall provide, within ten (10) days of such request, such information as may be required by the Company or such representative in connection with the completion of any public offering of the Company's securities pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. The obligations described in this Section shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a Commission Rule 145 transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred eighty (180) day period. Any transferee of this option also shall be bound by this Paragraph 12. The certificate evidencing the Shares will be imprinted with any legend the Company, in its discretion, deems appropriate to indicate the restrictions set forth in this Paragraph 12.
          13. No Initial Public Offering. If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that an initial listing or registration of any Shares upon any securities exchange or under federal law is not likely to occur, the Committee may, in its discretion, determine that this option shall be converted to an option to purchase shares of common stock of LSI Logic Corporation by such means as the Committee deems appropriate. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the outstanding option will be converted to an option to purchase shares of common stock of LSI Logic Corporation as follows:
          (a) The option to purchase shares of common stock of LSI Logic Corporation shall be exercisable for the number of Shares subject to the then outstanding portion of this option multiplied by the "Conversion Ratio" (as defined below), with the resulting number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share; and
          (b) The per share exercise price of the option to purchase shares of common stock of LSI Logic Corporation shall be equal to the quotient of the per Share exercise price of this option divided by the Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
          For purposes of this Agreement, "Conversion Ratio" means the Fair Market Value of a Share immediately prior to the date the option is being converted divided by the fair market value of a share of LSI Logic Corporation common stock at the time of the conversion.
 
          14. Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this option shall be subject to the definitive agreement governing such Change in Control. Such agreement, without the Employee's consent and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan, may provide for: (a) the assumption of this option by the surviving corporation or its parent; (b) the substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of options with substantially the same terms as this option; (c) the substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of other awards having a value at least equal to the value as this option; (d) the conversion of this option into an option to purchase the consideration received by the stockholders of the Company in the Change in Control; (e) the termination of this option after the Company shall have provided the Employee with the ability to exercise this option, to the extent then exercisable, for a period of fifteen (15) days or less before the consummation of the Change in Control; or (f) the cancellation of this option after payment to the Employee of an amount in cash or cash equivalents equal to (A) the fair market value of the Shares subject to this option at the time of the Change in Control minus (B) the Exercise Price of the Shares subject to this option at the time of the Change in Control. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the exercisability and vesting of this option in connection with any of the foregoing alternatives. For purposes of this Agreement, "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the 1934 Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; (b) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (c) a change in the composition of the Board occurring within a two-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors; (d) the approval by the shareholders of the Company, or if shareholder approval is not required, by the Board, of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company; or (e) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, a Change in Control shall not include the registration of any class of the Company's securities pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor any event or series of events through which LSI Logic Corporation ceases to own a majority of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company through a sale of Company securities to the public. "Incumbent Directors" means directors who either (A) are Directors as of the effective date of the Plan, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the Directors at the time of such election or nomination (but will not include an individual whose election or nomination is in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors to the Company).
          15. No Rights of Stockholder. Neither the Employee (nor any transferee) shall be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any of the Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of this option, unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee (or transferee).
          16. No Effect on Employment. The Employee's employment with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-will basis only, subject to the provisions of applicable law. Accordingly, subject to any separate, written, express employment contract with the Employee, nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Employee any right to continue to be employed by the Company or any Affiliate or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company or the Affiliate, which are hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. Such reservation of rights can be modified only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company or the Affiliate employing the Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, the transfer of employment of the Employee between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Service. In addition, a leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, shall not be deemed a Termination of Service for the purposes of this Agreement.
          17. Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company, in care of its General Counsel, at Engenio Information Technologies,
 
Inc.1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, California 95035, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.
          18. Other Benefits. Except as provided below, nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect the Employee's right to participate in and receive benefits under and in accordance with the then current provisions of any pension, insurance or other employee welfare plan or program of the Company or any Affiliate. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, in the event that the Employee receives a hardship withdrawal from his or her pre-tax account under the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), this option may not be exercised during the six (6) month period following the receipt of such withdrawal, unless the Company determines that such exercise (or a particular manner of exercise) would not adversely affect the continued tax qualification of the 401(k) Plan.
          19. Maximum Term of Option. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this option is not exercisable after the Expiration Date.
          20. Binding Agreement. Subject to the limitation on the transferability of this option contained herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
          21. Plan Governs. This Agreement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Capitalized terms and phrases used and not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan. This option is not an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may, in its discretion; issue newly issued shares or treasury shares pursuant to this option.
          22. Committee Authority. The Committee shall have all discretion, power, and authority to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith shall be final and binding upon the Employee, the Company and all other interested persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
          23. Captions. The captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
          24. Agreement Severable. In the event that any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
          25. Modifications to the Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered. The Employee expressly warrants that he or she is not executing this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, modifications to this Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
          26. Amendment, Suspension, Termination. By accepting this option, the Employee expressly warrants that he or she has received an option to purchase stock under the Plan, and has received, read and understood a description of the Plan. The Employee understands that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 4, 2005, LSI Logic Corporation issued a news release announcing a business update for the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004. A copy of this news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented for the fourth quarter of 2004 provides useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as it excludes charges, expenses, gains and losses that are not directly related to the ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business and/or stem from purchase business combinations.
Results of operations excluding special items for the period presented are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and LSI Logic's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.
The Non-GAAP financial information is arrived at by adding 54-58 cents per diluted share to the GAAP projection, and consists of acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items. The GAAP projection includes the previously announced estimated $180 million non-cash asset impairment charge associated with the Company's Gresham manufacturing campus in the fourth quarter of 2004.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today raised its 2004 fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share guidance, led by growth of the company's Storage Systems, Storage Components and Consumer businesses.
MILPITAS, CA 
LSI Logic expects to report 2004 fourth quarter revenues in the range of $415 million to $420 million, compared to the previously forecasted fourth quarter revenue range of $360 million to $390 million. The updated 2004 fourth quarter revenue range represents approximately 10 percent sequential revenue growth over the company's 2004 third quarter revenues of $380 million.
LSI Logic anticipates reporting a 2004 fourth quarter GAAP* net loss in the range of 53-55 cents per diluted share. The company earlier projected a GAAP net loss of 54-57 cents per diluted share. The GAAP projection includes the previously announced estimated $180 million non-cash, asset impairment charge associated with the company's Gresham manufacturing campus in the fourth quarter.
The company projects reporting 2004 fourth quarter net income, excluding special items**, in the range of a 1-3 cent profit per diluted share. The company earlier expected to report a net loss, excluding special items, in the range of 2-5 cents per diluted share.
 
LSI Logic expects 2004 fourth quarter gross margin in the range of 41-42 percent. The company earlier projected fourth quarter gross margin in the range of 41-43 percent.
"The growth of our Storage and Consumer businesses in the fourth quarter serves as a positive indicator that the inventory correction in the supply chain is substantially over in these two markets," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "Our Storage Systems subsidiary, Engenio Information Technologies, Inc., recorded a very strong fourth quarter. Our Storage Components business demonstrated broad strength through growth in storage ASICs, standard products and RAID storage adapters. Our Consumer business grew and inventory in our customer supply chain appears to be under control."
LSI Logic will not hold a conference call today about this news release. The company will report its 2004 and fourth quarter financial results, provide its 2005 first quarter business outlook and hold its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, January 26, 2005.
* Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ** Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.
Notwithstanding this news release, it continues to be the company's policy to not comment on financial analyst estimates or to provide periodic financial guidance updates.
This news release includes preliminary financial estimates and forward-looking statements, which include the following: the company's updated estimates of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004; projected GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2004; projected asset impairment charges associated with the company's manufacturing facility for the fourth quarter for 2004; projected net income, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter of 2004 and projected gross margins. These forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the time the statements are made and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI Logic's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: receipt of additional information impacting the company's fourth quarter results; further analysis of revenues and expenses for the fourth quarter; the strength of the global semiconductor industry and the timing and volumes of customer demand.

First quarter 2005 GAAP* net income was $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. The first quarter 2005 GAAP result compares to fourth quarter 2004 GAAP net loss of $197 million or 51 cents per diluted share, which included a non-cash charge totaling $178 million associated with the company's Gresham manufacturing campus.

Cash and short-term investments grew by $51 million to $866 million at the end of the first quarter of 2005. LSI Logic generated $59 million in cash from operations, representing the company's 12th consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow.
"Continued growth of existing products, the ramp of new products and the work down of supply chain inventory contributed to LSI Logic's sequential revenue growth and profitability in the first quarter," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "In Storage Components, LSI Logic demonstrated across-the-board strength in Storage ASICs, Storage Standard Products and RAID Storage Adapters. Our Engenio storage systems subsidiary experienced a seasonal decline in the first quarter. In Communications, we saw a modest increase in the enterprise networking space, while telecommunications was unchanged. Our RapidChip platform design wins continued to grow in the first quarter as we introduced the Integrator2 and Xtreme2 slice families and received increasing production orders for our Platform ASIC products. In Consumer, the company overcame traditional first quarter seasonality as a result of strong demand for our new products shipped into our diverse DVD recorder customer base across all geographies, the fast ramp of our digital audio products, and better-than-anticipated demand for our video game products.
"In Storage Components, we have established first-mover positions with major OEMs with our products for enterprise HDD controllers, SAS (Serial Attached SCSI), SATA, and RAID adapters. In Consumer, we are the market leader with our industry leading Domino architecture-based products in the DVD recorder space. We intend to leverage our technology and marketplace advantages across the board in the coming quarters."
 
"We reported sequential revenue growth and profitability above previous guidance in a quarter that is affected by seasonality," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "We are executing our financial plan and generating positive operating cash flow. We are anticipating sustained profitability on both a GAAP and excluding special items basis."
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the second quarter, and approximately $60 million in total for 2005.
Second quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $23 million.

Talwalkar as the President and Chief Executive Officer of LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company"), the Company entered into an employment agreement (the "Agreement") with Mr. Talwalkar, which sets forth terms and provisions governing Mr. Talwalkar's employment as President and Chief Executive Officer.
     . The Agreement has an initial term of two (2) years. The Agreement provides that the initial term will be automatically extended each year for an additional one (1) year term unless the other party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 120 days prior to the date of automatic renewal that it is electing not to extend the term. The Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause.
Term of Agreement
     . The Agreement sets Mr. Talwalkar's annual salary at $800,000, effective as of May 23, 2005 (the "Effective Date"). In addition, Mr. Talwalkar will receive a signing bonus of $500,000 within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.

Annual Incentive
     . Mr. Talwalkar was granted nonstatutory stock options to purchase 1,500,000 shares of Company common stock under the Company's 1991 Equity Incentive Plan at an exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for the common stock of the Company on the Effective Date.

Duties and Scope of Employment
          (a) . As of May 23, 2005 (the "Effective Date"), Executive will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer, reporting to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Executive will render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with Executive's position within the Company, as will reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. The period Executive is employed by the Company under this Agreement is referred to herein as the "Employment Term".
Positions and Duties
          (b) . Executive will be appointed to serve as a member of the Board as of the Effective Date. Thereafter, at each annual meeting of the Company's stockholders during the Employment Term, the Company will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board. Executive's service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Upon the termination of Executive's employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Board, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from the Board (and any boards of subsidiaries) voluntarily, without any further required action by the Executive, as of the end of the Executive's employment and Executive, at the Board's request, will execute any documents necessary to reflect his resignation.
Board Membership
          (c) . During the Employment Term, Executive will devote Executive's full business efforts and time to the Company and will use good faith efforts to discharge Executive's obligations under this Agreement to the best of Executive's ability and in accordance with each of the Company's corporate guidance and ethics guidelines, conflict of interests policies and code of conduct. For the duration of the Employment Term, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation, or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the Board (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Executive may, without the approval of the Board, serve in any capacity with any civic, educational, or charitable organization, provided such services do not interfere with Executive's obligations to Company.
Obligations
               (i) Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not party to any contract, understanding, agreement or policy, written or otherwise, that would be breached by the Executive's entering into, or performing services under, this Agreement. Executive further represents that he has disclosed to the Company in writing all threatened, pending, or actual claims that are unresolved and still outstanding as of the Effective Date, in each case, against Executive of which he is aware, if any, as a result of his employment with his current employer (or any other previous employer) or his membership on any boards of directors.
 
          (d) . Executive agrees to serve, without additional compensation, as an officer and director for each of the Company's subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies and other affiliates, including entities in which the Company has a significant investment as determined by the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" will include any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control of the Company.
Other Entities
     2. . Executive and the Company agree that Executive's employment with the Company constitutes "at-will" employment. Executive and the Company acknowledge that this employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or no cause, at the option either of the Company or Executive. However, as described in this Agreement, Executive may be entitled to severance benefits depending upon the circumstances of Executive's termination of employment.
At-Will Employment
     3. . This Agreement will have an initial term of two (2) years commencing on the Effective Date. On the second anniversary of the Effective Date, and on each annual anniversary of the Effective Date thereafter, this Agreement automatically will renew for an additional one (1) year term unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least 120 days prior to the date of automatic renewal.
Term of Agreement
     4. .
Compensation
          (a) . As of the Effective Date, the Company will pay Executive an annual salary of $800,000 as compensation for his services (such annual salary, as is then effective, to be referred to herein as "Base Salary"). The Base Salary will be paid periodically in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices and be subject to the usual, required withholdings.
Base Salary
          (b) . Executive will be eligible to receive annual cash incentives payable for the achievement of performance goals established by the Board or by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). Executive's target annual incentive will be at least 100% of Base Salary. For Executive's first year of employment, all performance goals will be deemed to have been achieved at 100% of target with such cash incentive to be paid at the first Board meeting following the end of the Company's 2005 fiscal year. The actual earned annual cash incentive, if any, payable to Executive for any performance period will depend upon the extent to which the applicable performance goal(s) specified by the Committee are achieved and will be decreased or increased for under- or over-performance.
Annual Incentive
          (c) .
Stock Options
               (i) As of the Effective Date, Executive will be granted nonstatutory stock options to purchase 1,500,000 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for the common stock of the Company on the Effective Date (the "Initial Option").

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On June 2, 2005, in connection with the appointment of Abhijit Y. Talwalkar as the President and Chief Executive Officer of LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company"), the Company granted Mr. Talwalkar a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Company common stock under the Company's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan at an exercise price per share equal to the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. This grant was made in accordance with the terms of Mr. Talwalkar's employment agreement, a copy of which was filed on May 24, 2005 as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K announcing his appointment.
     The shares subject to the option are scheduled to fully vest six (6) years after the date of grant, whether or not the performance criteria described below are met, subject to Mr. Talwalkar's continued employment with the Company through such vesting date.
     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has determined the performance criteria. Meeting such criteria annually would result in accelerated vesting over three (3) years, at one-third of the total shares underlying the option each year, subject to Mr. Talwalkar's continued employment on each scheduled vesting date. Vesting each year requires that the Company meet certain metrics for both revenue and operating profit. Cumulative metrics for both revenue and operating profit must first be met before any test of current year metrics and determination of vesting for that year's option shares can occur. If the metrics for both revenue and operating profit are not met for a particular year, but the cumulative metrics are met in a following year, the prior year's or years' unvested option shares shall vest.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition
On July 27, 2005, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2005. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three-and six-month periods ended July 3, 2005 and July 4, 2004, and the three-month period ended April 3, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-and six-month periods ended July 3, 2005 and July 4, 2004, and the three-month period ended April 3, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Results of operations excluding special items for the periods presented are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
Item 8.01 Other Events
The Company reported revenues of $481 million in the second quarter of 2005, a seven percent sequential increase compared to the revenues of $450 million reported in the first quarter of 2005 and a seven percent increase compared to the $448 million reported in the second quarter of 2004.
Second quarter net income was $25 million or six cents per diluted share. The second quarter 2005 results compare to first quarter 2005 net income of $5 million or one cent per diluted share. Second quarter 2004 net income was $7 million or two cents per diluted share.
The company generated $60 million in cash from operations, reduced its convertible debt by $150 million and ended the second quarter of 2005 with $782 million in cash and short-term investments.

Milpitas, California 
Second quarter 2005 GAAP* net income improved to $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share compared to first quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Second quarter 2004 GAAP net income was $7 million or 2 cents per diluted share.
Second quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items**, increased to $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share compared to first quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2004 net income was $28 million or 7 cents per diluted share.
"Increased customer demand for LSI Logic's Storage Components and Storage Systems product offerings provided the momentum for LSI Logic to report a solid second quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Storage Components, comprised of Storage ASICs, Storage Standard Products and RAID Storage Adapters, set the pace for the company with a record second quarter. Our Engenio storage systems subsidiary benefited from the successful introduction of its higher-end product line. Growth in Communications reflected stronger than anticipated demand from enterprise networking customers. In Consumer, we were pleased with the revenue strength in DoMiNo-based DVD-recorder and cable set-top box markets, as well as digital audio products, which was balanced by the seasonal decline in game console revenues.
"LSI Logic generated significant sequential and year-over-year revenue growth," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "Our gross margins increased over the prior quarter. Profitability improved, both on a GAAP and excluding special items basis. We generated $60 million in cash from operations, reduced convertible debt by $150 million and ended the second quarter of 2005 with $782 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the third quarter, and approximately $60 million in total for 2005.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $23 million.

EXHIBIT 99.1
CC05-82
LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced a broad-based reorganization to better position the company to pursue increased growth in its primary markets: custom integrated circuits, consumer products, and storage platforms and products.
MILPITAS, CA 
Four major business groups  Custom Solutions Group (CSG), Consumer Products Group (CPG), Storage Components Group (SCG) and Engenio  were established as a result of the companywide reorganization and three corporate officers were appointed. The major business groups will report directly to the executive office.
"We have intensified our focus on our targeted business sectors and we are fully leveraging our intellectual property and engineering resources for the benefit of our global customer base," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "These structural changes and the revamped leadership team are intended to reinvigorate the company's talented workforce and to strengthen LSI Logic's competitive presence in its chosen markets."
LSI Logic has formed the Custom Solutions Group (CSG), which will be responsible for the company's Standard Cell, RapidChip Platform ASIC and Design Services offerings. Jeff Richardson, 40, will serve as the general manager and executive vice president of the Custom Solutions Group. The focus of the Custom Solutions Group is to expand LSI Logic's market presence in the estimated $20 billion global ASIC market.
 
The Consumer Products Group (CPG) is focused on providing standard product and custom solutions for consumer end markets based on core competencies in digital media processing. The group is directed by Umesh Padval, general manager and executive vice president. Padval, 47, directed LSI Logic into a leadership position in high growth consumer applications including: DVD recorder, portable digital audio players and digital set top boxes.
The Storage Components Group (SCG) is focused on storage standard products, including Ultra320 SCSI controllers, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and SATA solutions. The group is directed by Bill Wuertz, general manager and senior vice president. Wuertz, 47, directed LSI Logic to a leadership position in both the SCSI and SAS markets.
The corporate realignment incorporates LSI Logic's RAID Storage Adapters (RSA) division into Engenio Information Technologies Inc., LSI Logic's storage systems subsidiary. Engenio will be directed by Phil Bullinger, Engenio general manager and senior vice president. Bullinger, 41, was vice president and general manager of RSA, taking this position when LSI Logic acquired the RAID business of American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) in 2001.
"The new Engenio will focus on delivering unique and exceptional value to our customers and end users of our technology," said Talwalkar. "The combination of RSA and Engenio will more efficiently deliver a broad and common portfolio of software, storage products and platforms to meet OEM customer needs and to deliver greater shareholder value. Market conditions at this time do not support a favorable IPO for our Engenio subsidiary."
 
The LSI Logic and Engenio sales forces have been joined to strengthen the company's worldwide sales efforts, increase execution and better position LSI Logic's total value proposition to its customers. LSI Logic Worldwide Sales is jointly directed by Frank Tornaghi of LSI Logic and Flavio Santoni of Engenio.
Tornaghi, 50, serves as LSI Logic's executive vice president of Worldwide Sales. Tornaghi is a 21-year LSI Logic sales professional. He will focus his energies on the components side of the company's overall business.
Santoni, 47, was appointed as LSI Logic senior vice president. He will focus on the global storage systems business, driving sales, marketing and customer support functions.
LSI Logic has created a Corporate Planning and Marketing organization to increase its marketing and planning focus. This group will be led by Phil Brace, senior vice president of Corporate Planning and Marketing. This new organization consolidates LSI Logic Marketing Communications, Corporate Public Relations, Investor Relations and Strategic Planning into one organization.
Brace, 34, was general manager of Server Platforms Group Marketing for Intel Corporation. He brings more than 12 years of marketing, sales and applications engineering experience across both silicon and systems products. Brace holds a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Sacramento and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada.
LSI Logic will hold an analyst conference September 14 in New York to further discuss the company's business strategies. Information regarding this meeting can be obtained by contacting Diana Matley, LSI Logic vice president of Investor Relations, (408) 433-4365, .

Exhibit 99.1
 
Company To Expand Leading-Edge Foundry Relationships; Pursue 65-nm Process Technology Roadmap; Sell Gresham Manufacturing Facility
MILPITAS, CA  LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced plans to adopt a fabless manufacturing model to better serve its global customer base, reduce production costs and adopt leading-edge process technologies.
The company's new manufacturing strategy foresees the expansion of its working relationships with major foundry partners and the adoption of a roadmap leading to the production of advanced semiconductors utilizing 65-nanometer and below process technology on 300-mm or 12-inch wafers.
LSI Logic intends to sell its world-class, eight-inch Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility. Throughout this transition from a fab-lite to a fabless model, LSI Logic will continue to meet the production needs of its worldwide customer base through the use of its Gresham factory and its foundry suppliers. LSI Logic will work diligently with its public sector partners, Multnomah County and the City of Gresham, to continue its partnership through the planned sale of the company's Gresham campus.
"Leading-edge foundries have consistently demonstrated that they have the capability to manufacture the advanced solutions required by our standard-cell ASIC, Platform ASIC and standard product customers," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Our customers are demanding
 
technology leadership from LSI Logic in the drive toward 65-nm process technologies and lower, and that is exactly the course we are going to follow.
"At the same time, we are seeking a buyer for our Gresham facility, which is capable of manufacturing designs at 0.13-micron and higher. We are putting retention plans in place so our Gresham employees can assist us in providing uninterrupted service to our customers. The adoption of a fabless model, the expansion of our foundry partner relationships, and the pursuit of a 65-nm process technology roadmap is the right manufacturing strategy for LSI Logic to better serve its customer base, reduce manufacturing costs to bolster its competitiveness and to enhance value for its shareholders."
LSI Logic presently employs a fab-lite global manufacturing strategy, serving the manufacturing needs of its customer base at its Gresham, Oregon campus and at its foundry partners, TSMC, UMC, SMIC and ROHM Co Ltd. When the transition to a fabless model is completed, LSI Logic will meet the manufacturing requirements of its customers exclusively through engagements with its major foundry partners.
The company estimates it will record restructuring and other charges of approximately $75 million to $110 million in the third quarter of 2005 for fixed asset write-downs, severance and other expenses associated with the planned sale of the Gresham manufacturing facility. The company anticipates incurring related restructuring charges of less than $3 million per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first two quarters of 2006.
LSI Logic is holding an analyst conference in New York tomorrow (September 14) to discuss its business plans, including today's announcement of the company's newly adopted manufacturing strategy, and to introduce its new leadership team. The 1 p.m. EDT, 10 a.m. PDT conference can be monitored via

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 26, 2005, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the third quarter ended October 2, 2005. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 22005 and October 3, 2004, and the three-month period ended July 3, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 2, 2005 and October 3, 2004, and the three-month period ended July 3, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
,
Results of operations excluding special items for the periods presented are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company reported revenues of $482 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to revenues of $481 million reported in the second quarter of 2005 and a 27 percent increase compared to the $380 million reported in the third quarter of 2004.
Third quarter net loss of $73 million or 19 cents per diluted share was primarily attributable to the $91 million restructuring charge associated with the planned sale of the company's Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility. The third quarter 2005 results compare to second quarter 2005 net income of $25 million or six cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2004 net loss was $282 million or 73 cents per diluted share, and included a $206 million non-cash charge for the impairment of the Gresham, Oregon facility.

**     Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.
 
LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported third quarter 2005 revenues of $482 million compared to the $481 million reported in the second quarter of 2005, and a 27 percent increase over the $380 million reported in the third quarter of 2004.
Milpitas, California 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $845 million at the end of the third quarter of 2005. LSI Logic generated positive operating cash flow for the 14th consecutive quarter.
Third quarter 2005 GAAP* net loss of $73 million or 19 cents per diluted share was mainly attributable to the $91 million restructuring charge associated with the planned sale of the company's Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility. The company anticipates incurring related restructuring charges of less than $3 million per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first two quarters of 2006. LSI Logic reported second quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2004 GAAP net loss was $282 million or 73 cents per diluted share, which included a $206 million non-cash charge for the Gresham facility impairment.
Third quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items**, was $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share compared to second quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2004 net loss was $25 million or 7 cents per diluted share.
"Our storage systems subsidiary, Engenio Information Technologies, reported record third quarter revenues and our Consumer Products Group revenues, led by our DoMiNo architecture-based products for DVD-recorder and cable set-top box customers and custom solutions for the digital audio player market, were robust in the third quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "After serving as a primary driver in the first two quarters of the year, our storage ASICs and storage standard products businesses softened in the third quarter as customers worked down inventory. We are confident that the insatiable demand for storage, coupled with our market leadership and first-mover advantages, is expected to drive fourth quarter revenue growth for these businesses.
"In the third quarter, LSI Logic announced a broad-based reorganization and the adoption of a fabless manufacturing model. We are on track to exceed the Semiconductor Industry Association's current estimate of six percent for the worldwide semiconductor industry's 2005 growth rate. During the coming quarters, we will intensify our efforts to drive long-term revenue growth, capitalize on our market share and technology leadership positions in strategic markets and identify opportunities to enhance our competitive position in the global marketplace."
"LSI Logic continues to stay focused on streamlining operations and driving profitability," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "We have increased our ongoing
 
efforts to identify synergies and drive efficiencies across the company in order to deliver greater value to our shareholders.
"Since we announced our intent to sell our Gresham manufacturing facility, we have had detailed discussions with numerous parties. The process of selling a semiconductor fabrication facility is complex, but we are encouraged by the interest from qualified buyers."
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the fourth quarter, and approximately $60 million in total for 2005.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million.

LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three- and 12-month periods ended December 312005 and December 31, 2004, and the three-month period ended October 2, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three- and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the three-month period ended October 2, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
     On March 6, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's intention to focus on storage and consumer markets. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
CC06-04
- LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced plans to focus its business on growth opportunities in the information storage and consumer markets, increasing research and development (R&D) investments, while redirecting R&D from non-core areas and reducing associated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenditures.
MILPITAS, Calif., March 6, 2006
Executing a new strategy that adopts a strong market orientation, the company intends to strengthen investments in growing markets where it has a significant, scalable presence and the ability to sustain differentiation. The strategy also calls for trimming non-core areas through decreased investment or divestiture.
"By focusing our resources on fewer markets, where our deep insight and unique silicon-to-systems capabilities can be fully leveraged, we anticipate delivering greater value to customers," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Today, we are taking specific actions to significantly enhance our ability to target growing opportunities in the storage and consumer markets, where rapid information growth and the surging consumption of digital content play to our strengths in providing differentiated market solutions that incorporate silicon, systems and software."
LSI is a leading provider of technologies that create, store and consume digital information and content. Providing a broad range of products including custom silicon, standard silicon, system building blocks and software, the company is a market share leader in enabling information storage solutions for enterprises and media processing solutions for today's digital lifestyles.
Consistent with its increased focus on storage, the company has canceled its previously postponed plan for an initial public offering of its wholly-owned storage systems subsidiary, Engenio Information Technologies, Inc.
 
LSI intends to fund additional R&D investments in its focus markets by redirecting ongoing investments in its RapidChip platform ASIC technology, and by selling its ZSP digital signal processor (DSP) unit.
As a result, the company will cease further RapidChip development and realign its custom silicon capabilities to more deeply serve customers in the storage and consumer markets. RapidChip customer designs currently in production or under development will continue and are not affected by this action.
The company's ZSP unit, which provides licensed ASIC technology to the broadband and wireless communications markets, is expected to be sold. No timeframe for completion of this transaction is being announced at this time.
"RapidChip technology targets a broad-based set of requirements across a wide range of industry segments and applications, while our DSP technology has been primarily deployed in areas outside of our focus markets," said Jeff Richardson, LSI Logic executive vice president, Custom Solutions Group. "Further pursuit of broad-based ASIC opportunities in non-focus areas is inconsistent with our strategy. Going forward, our custom silicon resources will be concentrated to serve customers more fully within our chosen markets."
"Through the strategy and actions we are executing today, we are expect to drive increasing value for LSI and our customers," said Talwalkar. "The combination of keen market focus, rich technology portfolio, and our silicon, systems architecture and software expertise will create greater synergy and opportunity to build deeper, more valuable customer engagements."
NOTE: LSI Logic is not updating financial guidance at this time.
LSI Logic will hold a conference call and webcast tomorrow, Tuesday, March 7 at 8:30 a.m. EST to discuss today's announcement.
The webcast can be accessed at www.videonewswire.com/event.asp?id=32751.
A telephonic replay of the March 7 conference call will be available beginning the same day at approximately 10:30 a.m. EST and will run for 48 hours. The replay access numbers are 1-800-405-2236 within the U.S. and 1-303-590-3000 for all other locations, passcode 11055808#. The webcast will be archived at http://www.lsi.com/investors.
LSI Logic will also be participating in the upcoming Morgan Stanley Semiconductor & Systems Conference in Dana Point, California on March 8, 2006.
This news release contains forward-looking statements, which include the following: the intention to focus business and growth opportunities in the information storage and consumer markets and no longer pursuing broad-based ASIC opportunities, the expectation to redirect research and development from non-core areas to the information storage and consumer businesses, expected SG&A savings, the expectation to sell the ZSP unit, and the expectation that the announced actions will drive increasing value for the company and its customers. These forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the time the statements are made and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI Logic's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the timing and volumes of customer demand, the company's inability to execute its intended strategy, the inability to capitalize on information storage and consumer market growth opportunities, the inability to reduce SG&A expenditures, the inability to sell the ZSP unit, and the inability to drive increasing value for the company and its customers. For additional information, readers are referred to the documents filed by LSI Logic with the SEC, and specifically the risk factors set forth in the company's most recent reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. LSI Logic is not obligated to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its Gresham, Oregon semiconductor manufacturing facility to ON Semiconductor Corporation's (Nasdaq: ONNN) primary operating subsidiary, Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, for approximately $105 million in cash.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 6, 2006
The agreement calls for ON Semiconductor's subsidiary to purchase the 83 acre wafer fabrication facility campus, consisting of multiple buildings with approximately 500,000 square feet of floor space, including an estimated 98,000 square feet of cleanroom space. The assets to be purchased also include a 200 millimeter-capable toolset and equipment that can produce 18,000 8-inch wafers per month.
Under the terms of the agreement, ON Semiconductor's subsidiary will offer employment to substantially all of the LSI manufacturing employees based at the Gresham site, with the remaining non-manufacturing workforce expected to continue their employment with LSI. ON Semiconductor's subsidiary will also enter into additional agreements with LSI, including a multi-year wafer supply and test agreement, intellectual property license agreement, transition services agreement and a facilities use agreement.
"We are very pleased to have secured a buyer interested in both the advanced manufacturing capabilities and the experienced workforce associated with our Gresham facility," said Abhi Talwalkar, president and chief executive officer, LSI Logic. "As a result of today's agreement, we anticipate providing uninterrupted service to customers while enhancing LSI competitiveness as we continue to execute our fabless manufacturing strategy."
In September, 2005, LSI announced plans to adopt a fabless manufacturing strategy to better serve its global customer base, reduce production costs, and adopt leading-edge process technologies. The company also announced it would seek to expand its working relationships with major foundry partners and adopt a roadmap leading to production of advanced semiconductors utilizing 65- nanometer and below process technology on 300-mm, or 12-inch wafers. Associated with adoption of the new strategy, the company announced its intention to sell its world-class 8-inch wafer fabrication facility in Gresham, Oregon.
 
The securing of a suitable buyer and closing of the transaction had been previously expected to take as long as one year from the date of the September 2005 announcement. LSI now however anticipates completing this transaction within the next 45 days. LSI does not expect to record a loss associated with the sale of the Gresham manufacturing facility. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals including those required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
This news release contains forward-looking statements, which include the following: the expectation of closing the sale transaction within the next 45 days, or ever, the expectation that the parties will satisfy all closing conditions required for the completion of the transaction, the expectation that all regulatory approvals will be granted, the expectation to provide uninterrupted service to our customers, the expectation to enhance LSI competitiveness through the sale of the Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility, and the expectation that no loss will be recorded associated with the sale. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties such that the sale transaction may never close. Risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the parties' ability to satisfy the required closing conditions, the granting of any necessary regulatory approvals, the company's inability to provide uninterrupted service to its customers, the company's inability to enhance competitiveness through the sale of the Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility, and the expectation that no loss will be recorded associated with the sale. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the company's management and on currently available information. LSI Logic undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement. For additional information, readers are referred to documents filed by LSI Logic with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, the risk factors set forth in the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 26, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three-month periods ended April 22006 and April 3, 2005, and the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and stock-based compensation expense and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2006 and April 3, 2005, and the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
,
Results of operations excluding special items for the periods presented are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company reported revenues of $476 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to revenues of $506 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005, and a six percent increase compared to the $450 million reported in the first quarter of 2005.
First quarter net income was $19 million or five cents per diluted share. First quarter 2006 net income included $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $14 million of acquisition-related amortization, restructuring, other special items and their related tax effect. The first quarter 2006 results compare to fourth quarter 2005 net income of $38 million or nine cents per diluted share. First quarter 2005 net income was $5 million or one cent per diluted share.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported first quarter 2006 revenues of $476 million, a 6% increase compared to the $450 million reported in the first quarter of 2005, and down 6% seasonally compared to the $506 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005.
MILPITAS, CA 
Exceeding guidance, first quarter 2006 GAAP* net income was $19 million or 5 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. First quarter 2006 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $38 million or 9 cents per diluted share. First quarter GAAP net income included $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $14 million of acquisition-related amortization, restructuring, other special items and their related tax effect.
First quarter 2006 net income, excluding special items**, was $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share, an increase of 76% compared to first quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2005 net income was $51 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments grew 19% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, from $866 million in the year-ago period and up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2005.
"Continuing strong demand for our silicon-to-systems storage products helped to offset an expected seasonal revenue decline," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth within our storage components and storage systems markets, with Engenio achieving near record quarterly revenues. Going forward, we expect to benefit from increasing demand and technology transitions in our storage markets as well as the growing demand for digital media processing products in our consumer markets."
"During the first quarter, GAAP net income substantially improved over the year-ago period as revenues expanded and we continued to carefully manage operating expenses," said Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer. "Our balance sheet remained strong, with cash and short-term investments topping $1 billion."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $10 million in the second quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2006.
Second quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $14 million.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 26, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the second quarter ended July 2, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release.
LSI Logic management believes that the presentation of a full non-GAAP income statement for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005 and the three-month period ended April 2, 2006, including non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP interest income and other, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP provision for income taxes and non-GAAP net income excluding special items and non-GAAP income excluding special items per basic and diluted share (collectively referred to herein as non-GAAP measures) provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports, and also facilitates comparisons with other companies in our industry, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP information.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
As described above, LSI excludes the following items in one or more of the non-GAAP measures:
Table of Contents
The calculation of non-GAAP net income excluding special items per dilutive share is adjusted in the numerator for all the items discussed above under net income excluding special items. In the denominator, the number of non-GAAP dilutive shares excludes the following item:
Table of Contents
Non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP interest income and other expense, non-GAAP provision for income taxes, non-GAAP net income excluding special items and non-GAAP net income per basic and dilutive share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered for illustrative purposes as being supplemental to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company's business in accordance with GAAP and such non-GAAP measures may be different from the computation of non-GAAP measures of other companies. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below in relation to the items excluded from those non-GAAP measures.
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005, and the three-month period ended April 2, 2006, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company reported revenues of $490 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared to revenues of $476 million reported in the first quarter of 2006, and a two percent increase compared to the $481 million reported in the second quarter of 2005.
Second quarter net income was $54 million or 13 cents per diluted share. The second quarter 2006 results compare to first quarter 2006 net income of $13 million or three cents per diluted share. Second quarter 2005 net income was $25 million or six cent per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
cc06-50
 
LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported second quarter 2006 revenues of $490 million, a 3% increase sequentially compared to the $476 million reported in the first quarter of 2006, and up 2% year-over-year compared to the $481 million reported in the second quarter of 2005.
MILPITAS, Calif. 
Second quarter 2006 GAAP* net income was $54 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $13 million or 3 cents per diluted share. Second quarter 2006 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share. Second quarter GAAP net income included $13 million of stock-based compensation expense and a net gain of $10 million from special items, acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and their related tax effect.
Second quarter 2006 non-GAAP** net income was $57 million or 14 cents per diluted share, an increase of 43% compared to first quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $40 million or 10 cents per diluted share. Second quarter non-GAAP 2005 net income was $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments grew 16% sequentially to $1.2 billion, from $1.03 billion in the first quarter of 2006 and up 54% from the year-ago period.
"All segments of our business grew sequentially during the quarter. Demand for our Engenio 4 Gb/s Fibre Channel systems strengthened, driving our storage systems revenues to near record levels and 17% higher than the year-ago quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Our communications revenues grew significantly year-over-year, as demand for existing long-lifecycle products increased and several in-process designs ramped to production. We anticipate accelerating demand for our storage products in the second half of 2006 as broad market transitions to 4Gb/s Fibre Channel interfaces and SAS-enabled servers are now well underway."
"In the second quarter, GAAP net income grew significantly, driven in part by successful completion of the sale of our Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility and our ZSP digital signal processor unit," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "Our balance sheet also strengthened, with a $169 million increase in cash and short-term investments during the period."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $10 million in the third quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2006.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $13 million.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 25, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the third quarter ended October 1, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release.
LSI Logic management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
Non-GAAP net income:
Non-GAAP net income is important to the Company for the reasons noted above and excludes the following items:
Table of Contents
Non-GAAP net income per basic and dilutive share:
The calculation of non-GAAP net income excluding special items per dilutive share is adjusted in the numerator for all the items discussed above under net income excluding special items. In the denominator, the number of non-GAAP dilutive shares excludes the following item:
Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below in relation to the items excluded from those non-GAAP measures.
Table of Contents
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, and the three-month period ended July 2, 2006, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company reported revenues of $493 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to revenues of $490 million reported in the second quarter of 2006, and a two percent increase compared to the $482 million reported in the third quarter of 2005.
Third quarter net income was $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share. The third quarter 2006 results compare to second quarter 2006 net income of $54 million or 13 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2005 net loss was $73 million or 19 cents per diluted share.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported third quarter 2006 revenues of $493 million, a 2% increase year-over-year compared to the $482 million reported in the third quarter of 2005, and up 1% sequentially compared to the $490 million reported in the second quarter of 2006.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 25, 2006 
Third quarter 2006 GAAP* net income was $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2005 GAAP net loss of $73 million or 19 cents loss per diluted share. Third quarter 2006 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $54 million or 13 cents per diluted share. Third quarter GAAP net income included $11 million of stock-based compensation expense and a net charge of $10 million from special items, acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and their related tax effect.
Third quarter 2006 non-GAAP** net income was $65 million or 16 cents per diluted share, an increase of 43% compared to third quarter 2005 non-GAAP net income of $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share. Second quarter non-GAAP 2006 net income was $57 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments grew 6% sequentially to $1.3 billion, from $1.2 billion in the second quarter and up 50% from the year-ago period.
"Revenues increased modestly during the quarter, with strong growth in storage semiconductors partially offset by expected lower demand for our portable media player products," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Total storage revenues were 17% higher than the year-ago period, fueled in part by increasing demand for SAS-enabled storage solutions. We further strengthened investments in our storage business, entering into a definitive agreement to acquire StoreAge Networking Technologies, a privately held maker of storage management applications software."
"Higher gross margins and improved operating performance contributed to solid third quarter results, with net income significantly exceeding guidance," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "SG&A expenditures as compared to second quarter 2006 declined on both a percentage and an absolute basis. Our balance sheet also strengthened, with a $68 million increase in cash and short-term investments."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $8 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2006.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $13 million.

Item 1.01.     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 3, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("LSI") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 3, 2006, by and among Agere Systems Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Agere"), Atlas Acquisition Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of LSI, and LSI (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Agere, with Agere continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of LSI (the "Merger").
Upon completion of the Merger, each share of Agere common stock that is outstanding at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time") will be converted into the right to receive 2.16 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock of LSI. Each outstanding option to purchase Agere common stock, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by LSI and will be exercisable for a number of shares of LSI common stock at an exercise price adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
LSI and Agere have made certain representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, representations regarding liabilities, employee benefit matters, intellectual property and environmental matters, and among others, covenants to (i) conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practices during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the merger, (ii) to convene and hold a meeting of their respective stockholders to consider and vote upon the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (iii) subject to certain exceptions, with respect to the Board of Directors of LSI, to recommend that their stockholders approve the issuance of LSI common stock in connection with the Merger, and with respect to the Board of Directors of Agere, to recommend that their stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including (i) obtaining the approval of the LSI and Agere stockholders, (ii) absence of any applicable law prohibiting the Merger, (iii) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other certain regulatory approvals, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, and (v) performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement, which has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contains representations and warranties of each of LSI and Agere. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a stockholder might view as material, or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the respective parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Investors should read the Merger Agreement, together with the other information concerning LSI and Agere that each company publicly files in reports and statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
The information set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01.     Other Events
On December 4, 2006, LSI and Agere issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement. The press release also announced that the board of directors of LSI has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of its common stock. The repurchases will be funded from available cash and short-term investments.
The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Important Information for Investors and Stockholders
In connection with the transaction, LSI will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC containing a joint proxy statement/prospectus. The joint proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to the stockholders of LSI and Agere.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) and Agere Systems Inc. (NYSE: AGR) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will be combined in an all-stock transaction with an equity value of approximately $4.0 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Agere shareholders will receive 2.16 shares of LSI for each share of Agere they own. Based on the closing stock price of LSI on December 1, 2006, this represents a value to Agere shareholders of $22.81 per share.
MILPITAS, Calif. and ALLENTOWN, Pa., December 4, 2006
The combined company, to be called LSI Logic Corporation, will offer a comprehensive set of building block solutions including semiconductors, systems and related software for storage, networking and consumer electronics products. The companies had combined revenue of $3.5 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2006. The companies operate in more than 20 countries, with a combined workforce of approximately 9,100 employees, including nearly 4,300 engineers. The companies together own a substantial patent portfolio consisting of more than 10,000 issued and pending U.S. patents.
Going forward, the new LSI expects to be well positioned to deliver significant benefits to its customers, shareholders and employees. By leveraging its increased scale, expanded IP portfolio and integrated workforce, LSI anticipates being a stronger, more competitive innovator of core technology and building block solutions that enable businesses and consumers to store, protect and stay connected to their information and digital content.
 
"LSI and Agere share a rich heritage of innovation and thought leadership in creating enabling technologies that bring people and information together," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "By joining forces, we expect the combined scale to enable us to extend our franchises in our market segments, realize significant synergies and better serve the needs of our collective customers, shareholders and employees."
"Together, the two companies should be well positioned to achieve greater success," said Richard Clemmer, Agere Systems president and chief executive officer. "The complementary products and capabilities of each can enable the combined company to pursue significant new opportunities while delivering more value to customers. Agere shareholders, employees and customers will benefit from the synergies and enhanced growth prospects that are anticipated to result from a larger, more competitive organization."
The combination of LSI and Agere is anticipated to create a semiconductor and storage systems powerhouse with an unparalleled innovation pipeline and a broad array of competitive, customer-valued products and solutions in large and growing markets. LSI's well-established presence in the storage and consumer electronics markets and Agere's broad footprint in storage, mobility and networking should enable the combined company to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value through the strengthening of its combined platforms and the expansion of its existing customer relationships.
"As valued Seagate partners, both Agere and LSI play an important role in providing products that help us deliver our industry-leading hard disc drives," said Bill Watkins, Seagate Technology chief executive officer. "We are excited by the innovative possibilities that this new combination represents."
About the Transaction
Under the terms of the agreement, Agere shareholders will receive 2.16 shares of LSI common stock for each share of Agere stock they own. Based on the closing stock price of LSI on December 1, 2006, the total consideration to Agere shareholders would be approximately $4.0 billion or $22.81 per share. Upon closing, LSI will issue approximately 379 million shares on a diluted basis to complete the transaction. At that time, LSI and Agere shareholders will own approximately 52% and 48%, respectively, of the combined company.
The combined company also expects to realize substantial cost savings beginning in 2007, with annual cost savings reaching at least $125 million in 2008 from increased efficiencies in manufacturing and operating expenses. The transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive in 2007 and meaningfully accretive in 2008 to LSI's earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis.
 
LSI president and chief executive officer Abhi Talwalkar will serve as president and chief executive officer of the new company, which will be headquartered in Milpitas, California, and will maintain a significant presence in Allentown, Pennsylvania with various other locations worldwide. LSI non-executive chairman James Keyes will continue as non-executive chairman of the board of directors of the new company, which will be comprised of nine members, with six being designated by LSI and three being designated by Agere.
The transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders from both companies as well as customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The companies expect the transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2007.
Shares of the combined company will trade on the NYSE under the symbol "LSI."
Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati acted as legal counsel to LSI. Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom acted as legal counsel to Agere.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 24, 2007, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release.
LSI Logic management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
Non-GAAP net income:
Non-GAAP net income is important to the Company for the reasons noted above and excludes the following items:
Table of Contents
Non-GAAP net income per basic and dilutive share:
The calculation of non-GAAP net income excluding special items per dilutive share is adjusted in the numerator for all the items discussed above under net income excluding special items. In the denominator, the number of non-GAAP dilutive shares excludes the following item:
Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below in relation to the items excluded from those non-GAAP measures.
Table of Contents
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the three-month period ended October 1, 2006, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company reported revenues of $524 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, a six-percent increase compared to revenues of $493 million reported in the third quarter of 2006, and a three percent increase compared to the $506 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Fourth quarter 2006 net income was $59 million or 14 cents per diluted share.

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Completes Merger With Agere Systems
Monday April 2, 8:00 am ET
Creates Leader in Silicon-to-Systems Solutions for Storage, Networking and Consumer Markets
MILPITAS, Calif., April 2  LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) announced today that it has completed its merger with Agere Systems Inc. (NYSE: AGR), effective April 2, and that it will rename the newly merged company LSI Corporation. The company will continue to trade under the stock symbol LSI on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Today's merger marks the creation of a new company that unites two of the leading innovators in silicon-to-systems solutions," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Moving forward, our combined scale and resources will strengthen our ability to create value for customers and shareholders and win in our key markets."
The new LSI is uniquely positioned as a semiconductor and storage systems leader with an unparalleled innovation pipeline and a broad array of competitive, customer-valued products and solutions in large and growing markets. Its well-established presence in the storage, networking and consumer electronics markets should enable the company to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value through the strengthening of its platforms and the expansion of its existing customer and partner relationships.
Talwalkar added, "In the months since our merger announcement, we have developed detailed integration plans that should enable us to hit the ground running today as a single organization with clear leadership and goals. We have assembled a dynamic organization that blends the unique strengths of each company and we are confident that we can achieve the synergies and growth that we first outlined in December."
On December 4, 2006, LSI and Agere announced a definitive merger agreement whereby Agere shareholders would receive 2.16 shares of LSI for each share of Agere they own. Shareholders of both companies approved the merger at separate meetings held on March 29.
The two companies had combined revenue of $3.5 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006. The new LSI operates in more than 20 countries, with a workforce of approximately 9,100 employees, including nearly 4,300 engineers. The company owns a substantial patent portfolio consisting of more than 10,000 issued and pending U.S. patents.

     On March 30, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company") approved performance goals and a bonus formula under the LSI Logic Corporation Incentive Plan (the "Plan") that will be used to calculate the fiscal 2007 bonus (if any) for Abhijit Y. Talwalkar, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.
     The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Under the Plan, the Committee may choose from several specified performance goals. For fiscal 2007, the Committee chose three primary measures: operating income (weighted at 70%), annual revenue (weighted at 20%), and cash flow (weighted at 10%). The target fiscal 2007 bonus to Mr. Talwalkar under the Plan is 100% of his annual base salary and the range of the potential payout is from zero to 200% of his annual base salary. The actual bonus (if any) will depend on whether actual performance meets or exceeds the goals specified by the Committee. Also, the Committee retains discretion to decrease (but not to increase) the bonus otherwise indicated by actual performance.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     LSI Logic Corporation ("LSI"), as guarantor, has entered into Supplemental Indenture No. 2 (the "Supplemental Indenture") by and among Agere Systems Inc. ("Agere"), LSI and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), dated as of April 1, 2007, supplementing the Indenture by and between Agere and the Trustee, dated as of June 19, 2002, as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of May 27, 2005 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indenture, from and after the effective time of the Merger (as defined below) on April 2, 2007, LSI fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment and all other monetary obligations of Agere under the Indenture, including all payments of principal and interest.
     Agere has outstanding $362 million of 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due December 15, 2009 issued under the Indenture. Interest on the notes accrues at the rate of 6.5% per annum and is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes may be redeemed by Agere in whole or in part at any time on or after June 20, 2007. The Indenture contains customary events of default including payment defaults, covenant defaults and certain bankruptcy defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of LSI's obligations under the Supplemental Indenture.
     In addition, under the Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture, following the Merger, the right to convert the notes into Agere common stock was changed into the right to convert such notes into (i) LSI common stock at a conversion price of $15.3125 per share, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise receivable pursuant to clause (i), subject to adjustment for certain events, at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased.
     This description of the terms of the Supplemental Indenture is a summary only and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indenture, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On April 2, 2007, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 3, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among LSI, Agere and Atlas Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of LSI ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub merged with and into Agere with Agere surviving the merger (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, each share of Agere common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares owned by LSI, Merger Sub or Agere, or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of them) was converted into the right to receive 2.16 shares of LSI common stock. Approximately 368 million shares of LSI common stock will be issued to former Agere stockholders in connection with the Merger.
     As a result of the Merger, LSI has acquired the business and assets of Agere. Agere was a leading provider of integrated circuit solutions for a variety of communications and computing applications. Some of its solutions included related software and reference designs. Agere's customers included manufacturers of hard disk drives, mobile phones, advanced communications and networking equipment and personal computers. Agere also generated revenue from the licensing of intellectual property.

     Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors of Agere designated three Agere directors to serve on the Board of Directors of LSI following the Merger. On April 2, 2007, Messrs. Timothy Y. Chen, Malcolm R. Currie and R. Douglas Norby resigned from the LSI Board of Directors and Messrs. Richard S. Hill, Arun Netravali and Michael J.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 25, 2007, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 1, 2007. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
Non-GAAP net income:
Non-GAAP net income is important to the Company for the reasons noted above and excludes the following items:

Non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share:
The numerator used in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per diluted share is non-GAAP net income computed as described above. In the denominator, the number of non-GAAP diluted shares excludes the following item:
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 1, 2007, LSI Corporation began using the presentation attached as Exhibit 99.1 in meetings with investors.
The presentation contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
Non-GAAP net income:
Non-GAAP net income is important to the Company for the reasons noted above and excludes the following items:

Exhibit 99.1
     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of LSI Corporation and Agere Systems Inc., after giving effect to the acquisition of Agere by LSI using the purchase method of accounting and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 is presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet is presented as if the merger had occurred on December 31, 2006. You should read this information in conjunction with the:
     The pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the merger had been completed on the date indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the effects of:
     Pursuant to the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements, has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. LSI's management, with the assistance of a third party valuation firm, has determined the preliminary fair value of the intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the pro forma balance sheet date. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration issued and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Since these unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the merger, the actual amounts recorded for the merger may differ materially from the information presented. These allocations are subject to change pending further review of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the impact of potential restructuring activities.
     LSI and Agere have different fiscal year ends which end on December 31 and September 30, respectively.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 has been derived from:
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 has been derived from:
 
 
     .
 
1. Basis of Presentation
     On April 2, 2007, Agere became a wholly-owned subsidiary of LSI in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total estimated purchase price of approximately $3.9 billion is comprised of LSI common stock and assumed stock options and restricted stock units.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet is presented to give effect to the merger as if the transaction had been consummated on December 31, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations is presented as if the transaction had been consummated on January 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet provides for the issuance of approximately 368 million shares of LSI common stock, based upon a fixed exchange ratio of 2.16 shares of LSI common stock for each outstanding share of Agere common stock as of April 2, 2007. Under the purchase method of accounting, the fair value of the total consideration was determined using an average of LSI's closing share prices beginning two trading days before and ending two trading days after December 4, 2006, the date by which the acquisition was agreed to and announced, or $9.905 per share. Based on a fixed exchange ratio of 2.16 shares of LSI common stock for each outstanding share of Agere common stock and the total number of Agere options and restricted stock units outstanding at April 2, 2007, LSI assumed Agere options and restricted stock units covering an equivalent of approximately 58 million shares of LSI common stock.
     The fair value of options assumed was estimated using a reduced form calibrated binomial lattice model and a share price of $9.905 per share, which represents the average closing price of LSI common shares for two trading days before and ending two trading days after December 4, 2006, the date by which the merger was agreed to and announced. The fair value of unearned stock compensation was based on a price of $10.23 per LSI share on April 2, 2007.
     The total estimated purchase price for the merger is as follows (in thousands):
Preliminary Estimated Purchase Price Allocation
     The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to Agere's tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values. The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially from the preliminary valuation. Further adjustments to these estimates may be included in the final allocation of the purchase price of Agere, if the adjustments are determined within the purchase price allocation period (up to twelve months from the closing date). The excess of the purchase price over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of approximately $3.9 billion does not include the effect of restructuring activities because it cannot be estimated at this time. The estimated purchase price has been allocated as follows (in thousands):
Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
     LSI has estimated the fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Some of these estimates are subject to change, particularly those estimates relating to deferred taxes, property, plant and equipment and merger-related restructuring costs. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation as of April 2, 2007, and are subject to further review by management. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect adjustments to liabilities that will result from expected restructuring activities, as planning for these activities is still in the early stages and therefore, the resulting costs cannot be fully estimated at present.
 
Identifiable intangible assets
     LSI has estimated the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, using the income approach. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to further review by management. The following table sets forth the components of these intangible assets and their estimated useful lives as of April 2, 2007 (dollars in thousands):
In-process research and development
     In-process research and development, or IPRD, represents Agere's research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use when acquired. Using the income approach to value the IPRD, LSI preliminarily determined that $193,300 of the purchase price represents the value for purchased in-process technology. Due to its non-recurring nature, the IPRD expense has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of operations.
2. Pro forma adjustments
     The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet:
     (a) Adjustments to revenues (in thousands):
     (b) Adjustments to cost of revenues (in thousands):
     (c) Adjustments to research and development (in thousands):
 
     (d) Adjustments to expenses for selling, general and administrative (in thousands):
     (e) Adjustments to restructuring expense (in thousands):
     (f) To reverse Agere's historical amortization of intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2006.
     (g) To record the amortization of the premium paid for the Agere long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2006.
(h) The pro forma number of shares used in the basic and diluted per share calculations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the weighted average number of shares of LSI common stock combined with the number of shares of outstanding Agere common stock converted to LSI common stock at April 2, 2007, which was adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of 2.16 LSI common shares for each outstanding share of Agere common stock.
     (i) To record fair value adjustments for inventory acquired from Agere.
     (j) Adjustments to prepaid expenses and other current assets (in thousands):
     (k) To record fair value adjustments for property, plant and equipment acquired from Agere.
 
     (l) Adjustments to goodwill and intangible assets (in thousands):
     (m) Adjustments to other assets (in thousands):
     (n) Adjustments to current liabilities (in thousands):
     (o) Adjustments to long-term obligations (in thousands):
     (p) Adjustments to shareholders' equity (in thousands):
3. Restructuring costs related to post-merger LSI activities
     As part of combining the two companies, LSI expects to incur significant restructuring costs during the year commencing with the closing of the acquisition. The restructuring activities are expected to result from our identification of opportunities to streamline operations and maximize the integration of Agere into LSI's operations, and expected to consist of streamlining of the Company's overhead structure to reduce operating expenses. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect adjustments related to these restructuring costs, as management of LSI has not yet determined all of the restructuring activities and therefore, estimates of these costs cannot be determined at this time. Certain liabilities associated with these restructuring activities will be recognized in the opening balance sheet in accordance with EITF Issue No 95-3, and will result in an increase in goodwill.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On May 10, 2007, the Board of Directors elected Timothy Y. Chen to the Board. Mr. Chen is Corporate Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Greater China Region, of Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Chen has been appointed to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Upon his election to the Board, Mr. Chen received an option to purchase 30,000 shares of our common stock under our 1995 Director Option Plan. The option has a seven-year term, becomes exercisable in four equal annual installments and has an exercise price per share equal to the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.
     Also on May 10, 2007, the Board named Gregorio Reyes, a current Director, Chairman of the Board of Directors, succeeding James H. Keyes, who remains a Director.
     In May 2005, we hired Abhijit Talwalkar to be our President and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to an employment agreement that was described in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 24, 2005. In addition to providing for Mr. Talwalkar's salary, bonus and incentive and equity compensation, the employment agreement contained a number of relocation benefits. These benefits were provided because Mr. Talwalkar did not reside near our headquarters in Milpitas, California.
     The relocation benefits included a $5,000 per month housing allowance and reimbursement of closing and moving costs if Mr. Talwalkar moved to the San Jose area, in each case for the first two years of Mr. Talwalkar's employment with the company. These amounts are "grossed-up" for taxes so that Mr. Talwalkar receives approximately $5,000 per month after taxes to use for housing expenses and an amount equal to his reimbursable closing and moving costs. Mr. Talwalkar has not relocated to the Milpitas area at this time. On May 9, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors extended these benefits for an additional one year period.
     On May 9, 2007, the Compensation Committee also amended our commuter expense reimbursement policy. This policy provides that the company will reimburse covered expenses incurred by an employee residing more than 100 miles from their primary work location, if the company has approved the employee's participation in the program. Covered expenses include travel to the primary work location and lodging and meal expenses while at the primary work location. The policy also provides for a tax gross-up for participating employees. One of the amendments was to make the policy available to executive officers of the company.
     The Compensation Committee approved the participation in that program of Mr. Talwalkar (other than for housing expenses); Mr. Phil Brace, Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Marketing; and Mr. Jeff Richardson, Executive Vice President, Network and Storage Products Group. A copy of this policy is attached to this report as exhibit 10.2.

Item 2.05 Costs associated with exit or disposal activities
The Company announced today, June 27, 2007, a broad restructuring and an acceleration of merger related synergies to further reduce operating expenses. LSI announced that it will eliminate 900 positions or about 13 percent of its non-production workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring is the result of a portfolio review that LSI has been conducting under a three-phase business acceleration plan adopted following its merger with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007. In connection with the action, we expect to take charges in the second and third quarters of 2007 that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Item 8.01 Other Events
Attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report is a news release issued by LSI Corporation on June 27, 2007, concerning its financial performance for the quarter ending July 1, 2007, and operating expenses for three months ended September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) announced today a broad restructuring and an acceleration of merger related synergies to further reduce its operating expenses. As part of these cost savings, LSI announced that it will eliminate approximately 900 positions or about 13 percent of its non-production workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis.
MILPITAS, Calif., June 27, 2007 
The restructuring is a result of a portfolio review that LSI has been conducting under a three-phase business acceleration plan adopted following its merger with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007. Related to this ongoing review, LSI also announced today a definitive agreement with Magnum Semiconductor, Inc. in which they will acquire the LSI consumer products business for an undisclosed amount.
These latest initiatives put LSI ahead of schedule on its merger integration and are expected to reduce LSI Non-GAAP* operating expenses to between $255 million and $265 million in the third quarter and to between $245 million and $255 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The corresponding GAAP** operating expenses are expected to be between $290 million and $310 million for the third quarter of 2007 and between $275 million and $295 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The quarterly operating expense run rate exiting 2007 is inclusive of all previously announced synergies and cost savings. The company expects to make further progress on operating expenses in 2008.
Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO, said, "We are accelerating our timetable for aligning the resources of the new LSI with market opportunities and focusing on those markets where we possess leading technology and sustainable competitive advantages. Today's actions will position the company to improve our gross margins in our semiconductor business and to grow profitably in a competitive, fast-changing market."
 
The company also updated its outlook for the second quarter ending June 30, 2007 and revised its estimated revenue range to between $650 million and $670 million. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be between ($0.03) and $0.00 per diluted share in the second quarter primarily due to lower than expected revenues, partially offset by strong expense control and favorable product mix. GAAP loss is expected to be between 52 and 43 cents per diluted share, noting that the company is in the process of determining the exact amount of charges it will recognize in the second quarter.
Talwalkar said, "Our revised outlook for the second quarter reflects greater than anticipated softness in our businesses. Despite this, our business remains fundamentally strong, and we are confident of our long term direction. We continue to win new designs and we are strengthening our already solid relationships with industry-leading customers. We expect revenue to grow sequentially in the second half of 2007 based on typical seasonal patterns."
Bryon Look, chief financial officer, said, "The steps we are taking today are designed to accelerate the synergies from the merger and further improve our cost structure. As a result, we will be better positioned to increase operating income and create shareholder value."
Additionally, the company said that it has purchased approximately $400 million of its stock during the quarter as part of its previously announced $500 million stock repurchase program. Look added, "We remain committed to our share repurchase program and anticipate that our cash-generating capability would enable us to continue to repurchase shares in the future."
The company continues to work through phase one of its three-phase business acceleration plan, with current businesses of storage systems and semiconductors targeting storage, networking and mobility applications.
The company will report second quarter results on July 25, 2007 and has scheduled an analyst meeting for July 31, 2007 in New York City.
*Excludes a one-time mark-up to inventory as part of the purchase accounting associated with the April 2, 2007 merger with Agere, stock based compensation, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and acquired in-process research and development. It also excludes the income tax effect associated with the above mentioned items.

About LSI
Editor's Notes:

 
Exhibit 99.2
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) and Magnum Semiconductor, Inc. announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Magnum will acquire the LSI consumer products business in a transaction to be funded by private equity investment.
MILPITAS, Calif., June 27, 2007 
The combination of each company's consumer products portfolio is expected to allow Magnum to strengthen its position as a leading provider of chips, software and platforms for consumer entertainment systems. The sale of the consumer products business will enable LSI to focus its investments on its businesses in the storage, networking and mobility market segments. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter and is not subject to regulatory approval. Financial terms are not being disclosed.
Jack Guedj, president and CEO of Magnum Semiconductor, said, "By taking this step we bring in people, talent and products that will accelerate our revenue ramp and our R&D efforts. Magnum now becomes one of the leaders in audio/video chips and software for the consumer electronics market. We also gain access to the market for professional broadcast solutions that deliver content to consumers."
With this transaction, Magnum Semiconductor strengthens the company's existing DVD, digital TV and digital entertainment center solutions while also adding MPEG-2 and H.264 high-definition media processing and low-power 3D graphics products to its portfolio. "Combining Magnum Semiconductor and the LSI consumer products business enhances and expands the products and services we offer to consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide," Guedj said.
Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO, said, "After exploring a full range of strategic options, we have determined that the best opportunity for the long term
 
success of our consumer products business is an external one. The combination of both companies' strong product portfolios, together with strong backing from top-tier private equity firms and a solid technical and management team will position Magnum to achieve scale and success in the consumer electronics market."
The definitive agreement is the result of an ongoing strategic review within LSI of its business portfolio following its merger with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007.
Under the terms of the agreement, Magnum will purchase the LSI DoMiNo, Domino[X] and Zevio architectures, products and related IP of the LSI consumer products business. Additionally, Magnum will offer employment to a significant number of LSI employees associated with the business. The two companies will also work together to seamlessly transition the business to continue to offer customers the highest quality products, services and support.

Table of Contents
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 25, 2007, we announced a strategic initiative to transition the worldwide assembly and testing of our semiconductor and storage systems products to contract manufacturers. The initiative is expected to achieve greater cost efficiencies through the adoption of a variable cost structure and to provide for scalable capacity without additional capital investment.
In connection with this initiative, on July 25, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our semiconductor assembly and test operations in Thailand to an affiliate of STATS ChipPAC Ltd. for approximately $100 million. The Thailand facility consists of approximately 440,000 square feet of floor space and employs approximately 1100 people. LSI currently obtains assembly and test services from STATS ChipPAC.
Under the terms of the agreement, STATS ChipPAC will offer employment to substantially all of the LSI manufacturing employees based at the site, with the remaining non-manufacturing workforce expected to continue their employment with LSI. STATS ChipPAC and LSI will also enter into additional agreements, including a multi-year wafer assembly and test agreement and a transition services agreement.
The transaction is expected to close within 90 days, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
We also announced that we will transition semiconductor and storage systems assembly and test operations performed at our facilities in Singapore and Wichita, Kansas to current contract manufacturing partners. The transition of these operations is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008.
Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 25, 2007, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended July 1, 2007. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:

Exhibit 99.1
cc07-51
 
 
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported second quarter 2007 revenues of $670 million, compared to $490 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $465 million in the first quarter of 2007. LSI second quarter financial results reflect the integration of the former Agere Systems. The company's merger transaction with Agere closed on April 2, 2007.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 25, 2007 
Second quarter 2007 GAAP* net loss was $378 million or 50 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $54 million or 13 cents per diluted share. Second quarter 2007 GAAP results compare to first quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $30 million or 7 cents per diluted share. Second quarter 2007 GAAP net loss included $22.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, and a net charge of $340.9 million from other special items, principally related to the company's merger with Agere.
Second quarter 2007 non-GAAP** net loss was $14.2 million or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $57 million or 14 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income was $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that it has completed its $500 million share repurchase program.
"During our first full quarter of combined operations with Agere, we took significant steps to accelerate our merger integration, and signed a definitive agreement to sell our consumer products business to Magnum Semiconductor," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. Today, we're also announcing a global transition to third-party assembly and test contract manufacturing to leverage greater cost efficiencies and provide scalable capacity. As part of this transition, we have agreed to sell our Thailand assembly and test operations to STATS ChipPAC Ltd. for approximately $100 million.
"Customers are responding positively to the new LSI and our business remains fundamentally strong," added Talwalkar. "We are winning significant new designs with industry-leading customers as a result of the combination of LSI and Agere, and I am confident that we are well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives. We expect revenue to grow sequentially in the second half of 2007, consistent with typical seasonal patterns."
Bryon Look, LSI Chief financial officer, said, "We are continuing to drive strategic focus and accelerate operational efficiencies. The steps taken during the second quarter and the manufacturing decisions announced today are significant components of positioning the company for profitable growth."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the third quarter and approximately $80 million in total for 2007.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $25 million.

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current opinions and estimates of management. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the challenges and costs of integrating and restructuring our operations and achieving anticipated synergies following our recent acquisition of Agere Systems; a delay in the closing of the sale of our Consumer business to Magnum Semiconductor; our ability to successfully and timely transition our assembly and test operations to third parties; fluctuations in the timing and volumes of customer demand; our reliance on major customers and suppliers; our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets; our ability to keep up with rapid technological change; the unavailability of appropriate levels of manufacturing capacity; and general industry and market conditions. For additional information, see the documents filed by LSI with the SEC, and specifically the risk factors set forth in the company's most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.

On June 27, 2007, the Company announced a broad restructuring and an acceleration of merger related synergies to further reduce operating expenses. LSI announced that it will eliminate 900 positions or about 13 percent of its non-production workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring is the result of a portfolio review that LSI has been conducting under a three-phase business acceleration plan adopted following its merger with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007. In connection with the restructuring, we recorded a charge of approximately $24 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2007, which represents future cash expenditures for termination related benefits to be paid primarily by the end of the third quarter of 2007.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On October 2, 2007, we completed the sale of our semiconductor assembly and test operations in Thailand to an affiliate of STATS ChipPAC Ltd. for approximately $100 million, $50 million of which was paid in cash at closing and $50 million of which was paid in the form of a note due over four years.
     As part of the transaction, we transferred our assembly and test facility in Thailand to the buyer. That facility consists of approximately 440,000 square feet of floor space. Approximately 1,250 employees of the facility transferred to the buyer. Prior to the sale, STATS ChipPAC was a supplier of assembly and test services to us. In connection with the sale, we have entered into a multi-year wafer assembly and test agreement and a transition services agreement with STATS ChipPAC.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 24, 2007, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
     Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP taxes are important to the Company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
Non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share:
The numerator used in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share is non-GAAP net income computed as described above. In the denominator, the Company uses the GAAP basic and dilutive shares.
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

MILPITAS, Calif., October 24, 2007 
Third quarter 2007 GAAP* net loss was $141 million or 20 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2007 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $378 million or 50 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2007 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $184.7 million from special items, including $101.2 million of restructuring costs relating primarily to the sale of our mobility business, $70.6M in the amortization of acquisition-related items and $21.8 million of stock-based compensation expense.

Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that to date it has purchased approximately 67.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $549 million under two repurchase authorizations totaling $1 billion.
"Our solid quarterly results were driven by strong end customer demand in our storage and networking businesses and by achieving substantial cost reductions during our second full quarter of combined operations with Agere," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "Since the beginning of the third quarter, we have made significant progress on completing the first phase of our three-phase business acceleration plan, including completing the sale of our consumer products business to Magnum Semiconductor, our mobility products business to Infineon Technologies and our Thai final assembly and test operations to STATS ChipPAC.
"As a more focused company, we are now experiencing a significantly higher level of engagement with our customers and substantial increases in design win opportunities," added Talwalkar. "We are also continuing to execute our strategy to invest for long-term revenue growth in our core areas of storage and networking, acquiring Tarari, Inc., a recognized leader in deep packet inspection technology that enables advanced security and network control for service provider and enterprise networks. Through these initial actions and our strong focus, we are poised to achieve our long-term growth and profitability objectives."
 
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "We experienced healthy demand in both our semiconductor and storage systems segments, with double-digit sequential revenue growth in storage and networking semiconductors. Our continuing focus on driving organizational efficiencies and maintaining tight controls contributed to significantly lower operating expenses and improved margins."
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2007.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.

Indemnified Party
Losses
 
party contained in this Agreement to have been true when made and at and as of the Closing Date, or (ii) the breach by such party of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the extent not waived by the other party.
     (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and any Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) the Excluded Liabilities and any failure of Seller to discharge any of the Excluded Liabilities; and (ii) Buyer's waiver of any applicable Bulk Sales Laws.

     (d) Amounts payable in respect of the parties' indemnification obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

     (f) The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed Four Million Five Hundred Thousand ($4,500,000) in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability for all such claims shall not exceed Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000).

     (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss of revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, , , the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims (including, if applicable, punitive damages).

9.3 General Procedures for Indemnification
     (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the "") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any audit or investigation of a Governmental Body, action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any claim, action, suit or proceeding (including an audit or investigation of a Governmental Body) by a Third Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a ""), to assume the defense and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim that (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages, or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted by the Third
Indemnifying Party
Third-Party Claim
 
Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the claims for money damages. If the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify in full the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense or the settlement against such Third Party Claim. In the event that any party exercises its right to undertake any such defense against any Third Party Claim as provided above, then the other parties shall cooperate in such defense and make available at such cooperating party expense all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such party's possession and control relating thereto as is reasonably required to by the party conducting the defense.
     (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in this Agreement.
     (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary damages which are indemnified Losses the Indemnifying Party will fully satisfy. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such Third Party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 9.4 for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses relating thereto (including the costs of defense thereof) with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
     (d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim shall be incurred. Such notice shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such a claim as provided in Section 9.4(a). The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to
 
contest the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss or the basis of a claim for a Loss in an amount that is not yet known by stating with particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount thereof.

10.7 Waiver of Jury Trial
     Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On November 9, 2007, our Board of Directors amended Article III, Section 3.3 of our bylaws to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In a contested election, directors will be elected by a plurality vote. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who fails to receive the requisite majority vote must tender his or her resignation for consideration to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any such resignation in light of the best interests of the company and its stockholders, and any other factors it deems relevant, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and will disclose its decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer and, if it chooses to reject the offer, its reasons for doing so, within 90 days following certification of the election results.

Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.

If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice or other announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
-3-
 
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the chairman of the board, or (b) in the absence thereof, such person as the chairman of the board of directors shall appoint, or (c) in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the board shall fail to make such appointment, such person as the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall appoint or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors. In the absence of the corporate secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
     The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
     Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of
-4-
 
votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates' names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as he may see fit.
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
          (a) Actions other than Written Consent. For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
-5-
 
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors may, at any time within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)). If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be
-6-
 
construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
-7-
 
     Such inspector(s) shall:
          (a) Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
          (b) Receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) Count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          (e) Determine when the polls shall close;
          (f) Determine the result; and
          (g) Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
          (a) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at any meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these by-laws, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
          (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before a stockholders meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 2.16(a), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the corporate secretary of the corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the corporate secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than ninety (90) calendar days before the anniversary of the date that the corporation's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the prior year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10) day following the day notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any successor thereto) and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (or any successor thereto) (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected);
provided, however
th
-8-
 
(ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
     Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
     Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock of the corporation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
     Except as provided in Section 3.4 and in the case of a "Contested Election" (as defined below), each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. For purposes of this Section 3.3, a "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes "for" a director's election must exceed the number of votes "against" that director's election. "Abstentions" and "broker non-votes" will not count as votes cast with respect to that director's election.
-9-
 
     If, as of the last date by which stockholders may submit notice to nominate a person for election as a director pursuant to Article II, Section 2.16, the number of nominees for any election of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be elected.
     Election of directors need not be by written ballot.
     Any director may resign at any time upon written notice or upon electronic transmission to the attention of the corporate secretary of the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws:
          (a) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
          (b) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
     If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board ( as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
-10-
 
     The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
     Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
     Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, a majority of the board of directors, the president or the chief executive officer.
     Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be: (a) delivered personally or orally by telephone or sent by overnight or courier service, facsimile transmission or other form of electronic transmission (such as email), addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting; or (b) sent by first class mail, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat.
     At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
-11-
 
     A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need to specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.
     Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that, so long as shareholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
-12-
 
     The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in the by-laws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend the by-laws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the by-laws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors when required.
     Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of Article III of these by-laws, Section 3.5 (place of meetings and meetings by telephone), Section 3.6 (regular meetings), Section 3.7 (special meetings and notice), Section 3.8 (quorum), Section 3.9 (waiver of notice), and Section 3.10 (action without a meeting), with such changes in the context of those by-laws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the board of directors and its members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the board of directors or by resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the board of directors and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate
-13-
 
members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. The board of directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these by-laws.
     The officers of the corporation shall be a chief executive officer, a corporate secretary, and a chief financial officer. The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, a chairman of the board, president, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant corporate secretaries, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, and any such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these by-laws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person.
     The officers of the corporation, except such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 or Section 5.5 of these by-laws, shall be appointed by the board of directors, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment.
     The board of directors may appoint, or empower the president or chief executive officer to appoint, such other officers and agents as the business of the corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these by-laws or as the board of directors may from time to time determine. Executive officers of the corporation shall only be those officers expressly designated as such by the board of directors.
     Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by an affirmative vote of the majority of the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in the case of an officer chosen by the board of directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the board of directors.
     Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice or by sending an electronic transmission to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or transmission or at any later time specified in that notice or transmission; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice or transmission, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
-14-
 
     Any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation shall be filled by the board of directors if such officer was appointed by the board of directors, or by such other person as appointed by the board of directors to fill such vacancy.
     The chairman of the board, if such an officer be elected, shall, if present, preside at meetings of the board of directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the board of directors or as may be prescribed by these by-laws. If there is no president, or chief executive officer then the chairman of the board shall also be the chief executive officer of the corporation and shall have the powers and duties prescribed in Section 5.7 of these by-laws.
     Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the board of directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have general supervision, direction, and control of the business and the officers of the corporation. He shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, in the absence or nonexistence of a chairman of the board, at all meetings of the board of directors. He shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the chief executive officer of a corporation and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these by-laws.
     Subject to such powers as may be given by these by-laws or the board of directors to the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer, if there be such officers, the president shall have general supervision, direction and control of the business and other officers of the corporation. He shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the president of the corporation, and such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these by-laws.
     In the absence or disability of the president and chief executive officer, the vice presidents, if any, in order of their rank as fixed by the board of directors or, if not ranked, a vice president designated by the board of directors, shall perform all the duties of the president and when so acting shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions upon, the president and chief executive officer. The vice presidents shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed for them respectively by the board of directors, these by-laws, the president, chief executive officer or the chairman of the board.
-15-
 
     The corporate secretary shall keep or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation or such other place as the board of directors may direct, a book of minutes of all meetings and actions of directors, committees of directors, and stockholders. The minutes shall show the time and place of each meeting, whether regular or special (and, if special, how authorized and the notice given), the names of those present at directors' meetings or committee meetings, the number of shares present or represented at stockholders' meetings, and the proceedings thereof.
     The corporate secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar, as determined by resolution of the board of directors, a share register, or a duplicate share register, showing the names of all stockholders and their addresses, the number and classes of shares held by each, the number and date of certificates evidencing such shares, and the number and date of cancellation of every certificate surrendered for cancellation.
     The corporate secretary shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and of the board of directors required to be given by law or by these by-laws. He shall keep the seal of the corporation, if one be adopted, in safe custody and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or by these by-laws.
     The chief financial officer shall keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained, adequate and correct books and records of accounts of the properties and business transactions of the corporation, including accounts of its assets, liabilities, receipts, disbursements, gains, losses, capital retained earnings, and shares. The books of account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any director.
     The chief financial officer shall deposit all moneys and other valuables in the name and to the credit of the corporation with such depositories as may be designated by the board of directors. He shall disburse the funds of the corporation as may be ordered by the board of directors, shall render to the president, chief executive and directors, whenever they request it, an account of all his transactions as chief financial officer and of the financial condition of the corporation, and shall have other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or the by-laws.
     The chairman of the board, the president, chief executive officer, any vice president, the treasurer, the corporate secretary or assistant corporate secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president, or the chief executive officer or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any
-16-
 
other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
     In addition to the foregoing authority and duties, all officers of the corporation shall respectively have such authority and perform such duties in the management of the business of the corporation as may be designated from time to time by the board of directors or the stockholders.
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "") (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (collectively ""), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.
Proceeding
Agent
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
-17-
 
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     To the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, of if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
-18-
 
     If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending an Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Agent who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Agent, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Agent's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Agent's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to
-19-
 
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity in another capacity while holding such office.
     The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

Independent Counsel
     Upon resolution passed by the board of directors, the corporation may establish a trust or other designated account, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit), to ensure the payment of certain of its obligations arising under this Article VI and/or agreements which may be entered into between the corporation and its officers and directors from time to time.
     The provisions of this Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not an Agent (as defined in Section 6.1), but whom the corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or otherwise. The corporation may, in its sole discretion, indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent as permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The corporation shall indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent where required by law.
     If this Article or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then: (a) the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any Proceeding, whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
-22-
 
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract between the corporation and each Agent who serves in such capacity at any time while these by-laws are in effect, and any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any Proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.
     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VI to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 6.5 hereof), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any Agent in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the board of directors of the corporation.
     The corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
     Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the corporation under this Article shall be in writing and either delivered personally or sent by overnight or courier service, facsimile transmission or other form of electronic transmission (such as email), or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the corporate secretary of the corporation and shall be effective only upon receipt by the corporate secretary.

     The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these by-laws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records.
     Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
     Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may be deem just and proper.
     The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting, and at any special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.
     From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
-24-
 
     The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these by-laws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
     The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
-25-
 
powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
     Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
     Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, shall govern the construction of these by-laws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "" includes both a corporation and a natural person.

     The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in (i) the General Corporation Law of Delaware or (ii) the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.
     The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies.
     The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors.
     The corporation may adopt a corporate seal, which may be altered at pleasure, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.
-26-
 
     Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.
     The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
     The by-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 23, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the third and fourth quarters of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the Company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:
 
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
 
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
We monitor the recovery of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Our two reporting units are Semiconductor and Storage Systems.  We tested goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2007.
On January 22, 2008, we concluded that the current carrying value of goodwill for our Semiconductor reporting unit was impaired as a result of declines in the market price of our common stock. We expect to record an impairment charge in a range of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion by the time our annual report on form 10-K is due to be filed. We will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of this impairment. This impairment charge will be reflected in our financial statements as of and for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
cc08-06
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
MILPITAS, Calif., January 23, 2008 
 
 
Fourth quarter 2007 revenues were $741 million, a 41% increase year-over-year compared to $524 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006, and up 2% sequentially compared to $727 million reported in the third quarter of 2007 [2]. Adjusting for the sale of the mobility business, fourth quarter revenues increased 12.2% sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2007.
Fourth quarter 2007 GAAP* net loss was $2.0 billion or $2.88 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $59 million or 14 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2007 GAAP results compare to third quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $141 million or 20 cents per share. Fourth quarter 2007 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $2.1 billion from special items, including an estimated $2.0 billion non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill, $38.6 million in the amortization of acquisition-related items, $29 million of restructuring costs, $21.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $6.0 million of acquired in-process R&D.
Fourth quarter 2007 non-GAAP** net income was $94 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $75 million or 18 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income was $44 million or 6 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that to date it has purchased approximately 102.6 million shares of its common stock for approximately $771 million under two repurchase authorizations totaling $1 billion.
"Our strong fourth quarter results were driven by higher than expected seasonal demand for our storage products, with revenues and non-GAAP earnings significantly exceeding our guidance," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "In our core focus areas of storage and networking, revenues increased more than 12% sequentially, reflecting greater than 25% growth in storage systems and double-digit growth in storage semiconductors.
"With many new design wins across our storage and networking areas now firmly in hand, I am confident that we are well positioned to grow as these designs ramp to production in the future," added Talwalkar.
LSI recorded full year 2007 revenues of $2.60 billion, a 31% increase compared to $1.98 billion in 2006. The company reported 2007 GAAP net loss of $2.49 billion or
 
$3.88 per share. Full-year 2007 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $2.66 billion from special items, including an estimated $2.0 billion non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill, $192 million in the amortization of acquisition-related items, $189 million of acquired in-process R&D, $148 million of restructuring costs, $77 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $48 million from the purchase accounting effect on inventory. Full-year 2007 GAAP results compare to full year 2006 GAAP net profit of $170 million or 42 cents per diluted share.
Non-GAAP net income for 2007 was $168 million or 26 cents per diluted share compared to 2006 non-GAAP net income of $236 million or 58 cents per diluted share.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "In the fourth quarter we made significant progress on revenue growth, gross margin expansion, operating expense reduction and cash generation. Despite uncertain economic conditions, our business remains healthy and our forward looking guidance for the first quarter is within our expected range of seasonality."
Capital spending is projected to be around $14 million in the first quarter and approximately $50 million in total for 2008.
First quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.

On
February 22, 2008
, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers.  These agreements provide for the circumstances under which we will indemnify our executive officers and pay their expenses if they become involved in litigation as a result of their service with the company.  The agreements also provide a number of circumstances under which we will not indemnify our executive officers or pay their expenses pursuant to the agreements.  The benefits provided under these agreements are in addition to those provided by our bylaws.  We also entered into similar agreements with the members of our Board of Directors, replacing any existing agreements to which the Directors may have been a party.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 22, 2008

 
 
 
i
This Indemnification Agreement (Agreement) is made as of _________________, by and between LSI Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), and __________ (Indemnitee).
, the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increasing difficulty in obtaining directors and officers liability insurance, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance;
WHEREAS
, the Company and Indemnitee further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting officers and directors to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited;
WHEREAS
, Indemnitee does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee and other officers and directors of the Company may not be willing to continue to serve as officers and directors without additional protection; and
WHEREAS
, the Company desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as Indemnitee, to serve as officers and directors of the Company and to indemnify its officers and directors so as to provide them with the maximum protection permitted by law.
WHEREAS
, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
1.            INDEMNIFICATION
 
 
 
 
The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, or by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitees conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitees conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
 
1
 
 
The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor, against expenses (including attorneys fees) to the extent actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action or suit if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
 
 
To the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 1 or the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith.
 
2.            AGREEMENT TO SERVE
 
In consideration of the protection afforded by this Agreement, if Indemnitee is a director of the Company he agrees to serve at least for the balance of the current term as a director and not to resign voluntarily during such period without the written consent of a majority of the Board of Directors.  If Indemnitee is an officer of the Company not serving under an employment contract, he agrees to serve in such capacity at least for the balance of the current fiscal year of the Company and not to resign voluntarily during such period without the written consent of a majority of the Board of Directors.  Following the applicable period set forth above Indemnitee agrees to continue to serve in such capacity at the will of the Company (or under separate agreement, if such agreement exists) so long as he is duly appointed or elected and qualified in accordance with the applicable provisions of the by-laws of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or until such time as he tenders his resignation in writing.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create in Indemnitee any right to continued employment.
 
2
3.            EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE
 
 
The Company shall advance all expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding referenced in Section 1(a) or (b) hereof (but not amounts actually paid in settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding).  Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay such amounts advanced only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized hereby.  The advances to be made hereunder shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee within twenty (20) days following delivery of a written request therefor by Indemnitee to the Company.  Advances shall be unsecured and interest free and made without regard to Indemnitees ability to repay such advances.
 
 
Indemnitee shall  give the Company notice in writing as soon as practicable of any claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement.  Notice to the Company shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the address shown on the signature page of this Agreement (or such other address as the Company shall designate in writing to Indemnitee).  Notice shall be deemed received three business days after the date postmarked if sent by domestic certified or registered mail, properly addressed; otherwise notice shall be deemed received when such notice shall actually be received by the Company.  The failure or delay by Indemnitee to notify the Company will not relieve the Company of any liability which it may have to Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise, except to the extent that such failure or delay materially prejudices the Company.  In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitees power.
 
 
If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
 
3
 
 
In the event the Company shall be obligated under Section 3(a) hereof to pay the expenses of any proceeding against Indemnitee, the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such proceeding, with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election so to do.  After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same proceeding, provided that (i) Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his counsel in any such proceeding at Indemnitees expense; and (ii) if (A) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense, or (C) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding, then the fees and expenses of Indemnitees counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.
 
 
In making a determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitee shall be presumed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to have acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitees conduct was unlawful.  The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the burden of proof to overcome this presumption in connection with any determination, or any action or proceeding to determine, whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder.
 
4.            ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS: NONEXCLUSIVITY
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, the Companys By-laws or by statute.  In the event of any change, after the date of this Agreement, in any applicable law, statute, or rule which expands the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes shall be, , within the purview of Indemnitees rights and Companys obligations, under this Agreement.  In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties rights and obligations hereunder.
ipso facto
 
4
 
 
The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, its By-laws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee even though he or she may have ceased to serve in an indemnified capacity at the time of any action, suit or other covered proceeding.
 
5.            MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
 
Both the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that in certain instances, Federal law or applicable public policy may prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors and officers under this Agreement or otherwise.  Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company has undertaken or may be required in the future to undertake with the Securities and Exchange Commission to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of the Companys right under public policy to indemnify Indemnitee.
 
6.            OFFICER AND DIRECTOR LIABILITY INSURANCE
 
The Company shall, from time to time, make the good faith determination whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the officers and directors of the Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts, or to ensure the Companys performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement.  Among other considerations, the Company will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by such coverage.  In all policies of director and officer liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Companys directors, if Indemnitee is a director; or of the Companys officers, if Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer, or of the Companys key employees, if Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, if the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, if the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusion so as to provide an insufficient benefit, or if Indemnitee is covered by similar insurance maintained by a subsidiary or parent of the Company.
 
5
 
7.            SEVERABILITY
 
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law.  The Companys inability, pursuant to court order, to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable as provided in this Section 7.  If this Agreement or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been invalidated, and the balance of this Agreement not so invalidated shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
 
8.            EXCEPTIONS
 
Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:
 
 
To indemnify or advance expenses to Indemnitee with respect to proceedings or claims initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except with respect to proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation law, but such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be provided by the Company in specific cases if the Board of Directors has approved the initiation or bringing of such suit; or
 
 
To indemnify Indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous; or
 
 
To indemnify Indemnitee for expenses or liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) which have been paid directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers and directors liability insurance maintained by the Company; or
 
6
 
 
To indemnify Indemnitee for any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation, or any profits realized by Indemnitee from the sale of the Companys securities, under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or (ii) profits arising from the purchase, sale, or other acquisition or transfer of the Companys securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; or
 
 
To indemnify Indemnitee for expenses and the payment of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
 
9.            CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN PHRASES
 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, references to the Company shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that if Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, references to other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on Indemnitee with respect to any employer benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Company shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Company as referred to in this Agreement.
 
7
 
10.            COUNTERPARTS
 
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original.

(a) In the event that any action is instituted by Indemnitee under this Agreement to enforce or interpret any of the terms hereof, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all court costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such action, unless as a part of such action, the court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee as a basis for such action were not made in good faith or were frivolous.  (b) In the event of an action instituted by or in the name of the Company under this Agreement, or to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all court costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by Indemnitee in defense of such action (including with respect to Indemnitees counterclaims and cross-claims made in such action), unless as a part of such action the court determines that each of Indemnitees material defenses to such action were made in bad faith or were frivolous.  In addition, Indemnitee shall be entitled to advancement of the amounts in sections (a) and (b) above, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(a) of this Agreement.

On February 27, 2008, we finalized a bonus program for our executive officers for 2008.  Under the program, we must achieve specified levels of revenue and non-GAAP operating income for 2008 in order for our officers to be eligible to receive a bonus for 2008.  Once the specified levels of revenue and non-GAAP operating income are achieved, a "bonus pool" will be created for our executive officers equal to specified percentages of our 2008 non-GAAP operating income.  These percentages vary based on our actual revenue and non-GAAP operating income.
Target bonuses are expressed as percentages of individuals' base salary and, for our named executive officers are:

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 23, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended March 30, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc08-29
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended March 30, 2008.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 23, 2008 
 
 
First quarter 2008 revenues were $661 million, a 42% increase year-over-year compared to $465 million reported in the first quarter of 2007, and down 11% sequentially compared to $741 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007 [1]. Adjusting for the sale of the mobility business, first quarter revenues declined 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The first quarter revenue decline was less than expected on better than expected sales of semiconductors for storage applications.
First quarter 2008 GAAP* net loss was $14 million or 2 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $30 million or 7 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $2 billion or $2.87 per share, which included a $2 billion non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill. First quarter 2008 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $78 million from special items, including $55.7 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $4.6 million of restructuring costs, and $17.8 million of stock-based compensation expense.
First quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $64 million or 10 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $44 million or 11 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income was $94 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that it has completed the purchase of approximately 147 million shares of its common stock for approximately $1 billion under two repurchase authorizations.
"Our first quarter results mark the third consecutive quarter of revenues that have exceeded expectations and reflect continuing strength in our core business," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "Stronger than expected sales of our SAS and SAN silicon partially offset the effects of normal seasonality while the longer-term benefits of our strategic steps and sharp focus on storage and networking continued to grow."
"During the quarter we also won significant new silicon designs in the hard disk drive and server spaces and announced an innovative new family of single-chip, low-cost content inspection processors for security and networking applications which is receiving strong interest," added Talwalkar.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "In the first quarter we continued to generate strong operating cash flows and effectively managed our expenses, delivering a solid financial performance. Our balance sheet remains strong and despite continuing macro-economic uncertainty we remain confident in the health of our business."
     [1] The Company merged with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007.
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2008.
Second quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $25 million.

2003 Equity Incentive Plan
At our annual meeting of stockholders on May 14, 2008, our stockholders approved our amended 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Under that plan, we can award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and directors of the company. The principal changes to the plan were:
Housing and Commuting Allowance Extension for Mr. Talwalkar
On May 14, 2008, our Compensation Committee extended for one year the $5,000 per month housing allowance we have been providing to our President and CEO, Abhijit Talwalkar. The committee also extended for one year Mr. Talwalkars participation in our Commuter Expense Reimbursement Policy. That policy provides for reimbursement of commuting expenses for participating employees who live more than 100 miles from their primary work location. The committee took these actions after consulting the companys other independent directors.
Mr. Talwalkar will also be entitled to an additional payment equal to the taxes payable on the amounts described in the preceding paragraph.
These benefits will now expire in May 2009. The committee decided to take these actions because based on the amount of time Mr. Talwalkar spends traveling to company and customer locations around the world, the committee did not believe it necessary for Mr. Talwalkar and his family to experience the dislocation of having to relocate to the Milpitas area. At the same time, it wanted to encourage Mr. Talwalkar to spend as much time at the company's headquarters as he felt appropriate, without having his decisions affected by the financial impact on him of doing so.
 
Severance Policy
On May 20, 2008, we finalized a severance policy which will provide benefits for any member of our Executive Leadership Team whose employment with LSI is terminated other than for cause or who, following a change in control of LSI, terminates his or her employment with LSI for good reason. Good reason under the policy means a material reduction in a participants duties or base salary or a material relocation of a participants principal office.
The policy will become effective on June 1, 2008. For any member of our Executive Leadership Team who has an existing contractual severance arrangement, the policy will not apply until the expiration of that arrangement.
The term change in control is used in the policy with the same meaning as defined pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
In the event of a qualifying termination prior to a change in control, a participant will be entitled to receive the following:
In the event of a qualifying termination after a change in control, a participant will be entitled to receive the following:
2
In either case, the participant must enter into a separation agreement, including a full release of claims and non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants for the term of the severance period.
 
The policy, which is attached as Exhibit 10.3, contains additional procedural and timing requirements that must be met in order for benefits to be payable.

Shares used to pay the taxes associated with, and/or Exercise Price of, an Award will not become available for future Awards.  To the extent an Award is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, and subject to adjustment provided in Section 4.3, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will be 45,000,000 Shares.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 23, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended June 29, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the second quarter of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007 and the Consumer business that we sold in late July 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:
 
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its second quarter ended June 29, 2008.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 23, 2008 
 
 
Second quarter 2008 revenues were $692 million, a 3% increase year-over-year compared to $670 million reported in the second quarter of 2007, and up 5% sequentially compared to $661 million reported in the first quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the sale of the consumer and mobility businesses, second quarter revenues increased 24% year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Second quarter 2008 GAAP* net loss was $14 million or 2 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $378 million or 50 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to first quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $97 million from special items, consisting primarily of $58.6 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $20.7 million of restructuring costs and other items, and $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Second quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $83 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2007 non-GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. First quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $64 million or 10 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end.
"Strong worldwide demand for our storage systems and networking products helped us deliver another quarter of solid results," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "During the quarter, we also continued to build significant momentum for the future, introducing several new storage and networking products and securing additional silicon design wins with top-tier hard disk drive and server makers.
"Our business has demonstrated resilience through recent market uncertainty, and we expect this to continue as the positive effects of seasonal buying patterns materialize in the second half," added Talwalkar.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "Our second quarter results reflect the ongoing benefit of the many strategic and operational steps we have taken over the past four quarters. Increases in net income compared to the year-ago period were significant, and we continue to focus on improving our top and bottom line results."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2008.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.

Andrew Micallef, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Manufacturing Operations, is a U.S. resident who is currently on assignment at our request in Singapore. In connection with his assignment, he is receiving a number of reimbursements of travel, living and other expenses and tax gross-ups that are designed so that he is not disadvantaged by his international assignment. On August 19, 2008, our Compensation Committee approved an extension of Mr. Micallef's assignment in Singapore through June 30, 2010. The extension is on substantially the same terms as were previously in effect, except that due to the amount of time Mr. Micallef has worked abroad, we will not require him to repay his benefits if he resigns before his assignment in Singapore ends or within six months after moving back to the United States.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On August 19, 2008, our Board of Directors amended our by-laws. We clarified a number of provisions in the by-laws and made revisions to reflect changes in Delaware and other law, including changes to Section 2.4 to allow notices of stockholders' meetings to be sent by electronic transmission and to Section 2.5 to allow us to send a single written notice to stockholders who share a single address. We also amended the advance notice provision in the by-laws to remove ambiguities and to take into account recent Delaware case law. These changes include the following:
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
Prior to the amendment, Section 2.16 provided that nominations and other business to be brought by stockholders before a meeting of stockholders were to be made only: (a) pursuant to our notice of meeting; (b) by or at the direction of the board of directors; or (c) by any stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice, who was entitled to vote at the meeting and who otherwise complied with the notice procedures in Section 2.16. For a stockholder notice to be timely, it must have been delivered not later than 90 days before the anniversary of the date that our proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting had been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the prior year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must have been so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurred first. Such stockholder's notice must have included: (i) as to each nominee, all information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposed to bring before the meeting, a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of our shares which were owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the text of our amended by-laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.

     2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
          (a) Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation.

               (i) Participate in a meeting of stockholders; and
               (ii) Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (A) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (B) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.

Only such business shall be transacted at a special meeting as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board, by the president or by the chief executive officer. Nothing contained in this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board may be held.
     2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS
     All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing, by electronic transmission or by any other means permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these by-laws not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted), or (ii) in the case of an annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented by the board of directors or otherwise in accordance with these by-laws at the meeting for such action). Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and (unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides) any special meeting of stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the board of directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. For purposes of these by-laws, "" means
electronic transmission
 
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, which creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
     2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
          (a) Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at the address of such stockholder as it appears on the records of the corporation.
          (b) Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be effective if delivered by electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, which consent may be express or, if permitted under and in accordance with applicable law, implied. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability actually becomes known to the corporate secretary or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
provided, however,
          (c) Any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
          (d) Whenever notice is required to be given, under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
 
          (e) An affidavit of the corporate secretary, an assistant corporate secretary, the transfer agent of the corporation or other agent that notice of any meeting of stockholders has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     2.6
QUORUM
     The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice or other announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
     2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any (and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person at such adjourned meeting), thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.
     2.8
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the chairman of the board, (b) in the absence thereof, such person as the chairman of the board of directors shall appoint, (c) in the absence thereof, or in the event that the chairman of the board shall fail to make such appointment, such person as the chief executive officer shall appoint, or (d) in the absence thereof, or in the event that the chief executive officer shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors. In the absence of the corporate secretary, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
     The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
 
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
     2.9
VOTING
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
     Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates' names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) such holder of stock would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such holder's shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by such holder, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as the holder may see fit.
     2.10
WAIVER OF NOTICE
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
 
     2.11
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.12
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
          (a) Actions other than Written Consent. For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors may, at any time within 10 days after
 
the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)), which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the corporate secretary. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
     2.13
PROXIES
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic representation or
 
otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.14

ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting as an Indemnitee, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
 
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     6.3
SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE
     To the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
     6.4
DETERMINATION OF CONDUCT
     Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
 
     6.5
RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
     If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
     6.6
PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Indemnitee who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Indemnitee, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Indemnitee's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
     6.7
INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law,
 
agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
     6.8
INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION

     Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer (or, with respect to uncertificated shares, by delivery of duly executed instructions or in any other lawful manner permitted by the corporation), it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate or uncertificated shares to the person entitled thereto, cancel any old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.
     8.11
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS
     The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of
 
shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     8.12
REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS
     The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
     The by-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.

Andrew Micallef, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Manufacturing Operations, is a U.S. resident who is currently on assignment at our request in Singapore. In connection with his assignment, he is receiving a number of reimbursements of travel, living and other expenses and tax gross-ups that are designed so that he is not disadvantaged by his international assignment. On August 19, 2008, our Compensation Committee approved an extension of Mr. Micallef's assignment in Singapore through June 30, 2010. The extension is on substantially the same terms as were previously in effect, except that due to the amount of time Mr. Micallef has worked abroad, we will not require him to repay his benefits if he resigns before his assignment in Singapore ends or within six months after moving back to the United States.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On August 19, 2008, our Board of Directors amended our by-laws. We clarified a number of provisions in the by-laws and made revisions to reflect changes in Delaware and other law, including changes to Section 2.4 to allow notices of stockholders' meetings to be sent by electronic transmission and to Section 2.5 to allow us to send a single written notice to stockholders who share a single address. We also amended the advance notice provision in the by-laws to remove ambiguities and to take into account recent Delaware case law. These changes include the following:
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
Prior to the amendment, Section 2.16 provided that nominations and other business to be brought by stockholders before a meeting of stockholders were to be made only: (a) pursuant to our notice of meeting; (b) by or at the direction of the board of directors; or (c) by any stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice, who was entitled to vote at the meeting and who otherwise complied with the notice procedures in Section 2.16. For a stockholder notice to be timely, it must have been delivered not later than 90 days before the anniversary of the date that our proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting had been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the prior year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must have been so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurred first. Such stockholder's notice must have included: (i) as to each nominee, all information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposed to bring before the meeting, a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of our shares which were owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the text of our amended by-laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: August 25, 2008

Exhibit 3.1

     1.2
OTHER OFFICES
     The Corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the board of directors of the corporation may designate or as may from time to time be desirable in the conduct of the business of the corporation.
     2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
          (a) Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation. The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 2.1(b).
          (b) If authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "General Corporation Law of Delaware"):
 
               (i) Participate in a meeting of stockholders; and
               (ii) Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (A) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (B) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.
     2.2
ANNUAL MEETING
     The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. At the annual meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business brought before the meeting in accordance with Section 2.16(a) may be transacted.
     2.3
SPECIAL MEETING
     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time only by a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board, by the president or by the chief executive officer. A special meeting may not be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be transacted at a special meeting as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board, by the president or by the chief executive officer. Nothing contained in this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board may be held.
     2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS
     All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing, by electronic transmission or by any other means permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these by-laws not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted), or (ii) in the case of an annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented by the board of directors or otherwise in accordance with these by-laws at the meeting for such action). Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and (unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides) any special meeting of stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the board of directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. For purposes of these by-laws, "" means
electronic transmission
 
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, which creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
     2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
          (a) Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at the address of such stockholder as it appears on the records of the corporation.
          (b) Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be effective if delivered by electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, which consent may be express or, if permitted under and in accordance with applicable law, implied. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability actually becomes known to the corporate secretary or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
provided, however,
          (c) Any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
          (d) Whenever notice is required to be given, under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
 
          (e) An affidavit of the corporate secretary, an assistant corporate secretary, the transfer agent of the corporation or other agent that notice of any meeting of stockholders has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     2.6
QUORUM
     The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice or other announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
     2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any (and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person at such adjourned meeting), thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.
     2.8
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the chairman of the board, (b) in the absence thereof, such person as the chairman of the board of directors shall appoint, (c) in the absence thereof, or in the event that the chairman of the board shall fail to make such appointment, such person as the chief executive officer shall appoint, or (d) in the absence thereof, or in the event that the chief executive officer shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors. In the absence of the corporate secretary, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
     The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
 
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
     2.9
VOTING
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
     Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates' names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) such holder of stock would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such holder's shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by such holder, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as the holder may see fit.
     2.10
WAIVER OF NOTICE
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
 
     2.11
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.12
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
          (a) Actions other than Written Consent. For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors may, at any time within 10 days after
 
the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)), which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the corporate secretary. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
     2.13
PROXIES
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic representation or
 
otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.14
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
     The corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal place of business; or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
     2.15
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Such inspector(s) shall perform such duties as may be required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.16
NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS
          (a) Advance Notice of Stockholder Business.
               (i) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be brought: (A) by or at the direction of the board of directors or any committee thereof, (B) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), or (C) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in these by-laws and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.16(a). In addition, for business to be
 
properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these by-laws and applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business (other than business included in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "")) before an annual meeting of stockholders.
Exchange Act
               (ii) To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.16(a)(i), a stockholder's notice must be in writing, must set forth all information required under this Section 2.16(a) and must be timely received by the corporate secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by the corporate secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the 45th day nor earlier than the 75th day before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) for the preceding year's annual meeting; , , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the date of the previous year's annual meeting, then notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received by the corporate secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting, or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of such annual meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this Section 2.16(a)(ii).

THIRD PARTY ACTIONS
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "") (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (each person holding any such office or acting in any such capacity, an ""), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with such Proceeding if such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, or, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was lawful.

ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting as an Indemnitee, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
 
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     6.3
SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE
     To the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
     6.4
DETERMINATION OF CONDUCT
     Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
 
     6.5
RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
     If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
     6.6
PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Indemnitee who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Indemnitee, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Indemnitee's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
     6.7
INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law,
 
agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
     6.8
INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION
     The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnitee against any liability asserted against, or incurred by, such person by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

     8.4
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

cancelled at the same time.

     8.11
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS
     The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of

     The by-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 22, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended September 28, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the third quarter of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007 and the Consumer business that we sold in late July 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.

Exhibit 99.1
cc08-67
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its third quarter ended September 28, 2008.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 22, 2008 
 
 
Third quarter 2008 revenues were $714 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year compared to $727 million reported in the third quarter of 2007, and up 3% sequentially compared to $692 million reported in the second quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the sale of the consumer and mobility businesses, third quarter revenues increased 14% year-over-year compared to the third quarter of 2007.
Third quarter 2008 GAAP* net income was $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $141 million or 20 cents per share. Third quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. Third quarter 2008 GAAP net income included a net charge of $83 million from special items, consisting primarily of $60.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $16.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.7 million in write-down of investments, and $1.6 million in net restructuring and other items.
Third quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $94 million or 14 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $44 million or 6 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $83 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end.
"Healthy demand in the quarter for our HDD and SAN semiconductors provided a foundation for delivering solid results," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We are also pleased by our progress in securing new opportunities, with recently announced Tier 1 OEM wins for next-generation HDD, SSD and 6Gb/s SAS products.
"Although fourth quarter visibility is limited, we are confident that our strategic focus, continuing design win momentum and strong financial position leave us well positioned for the foreseeable future," added Talwalkar.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "Significantly higher gross margins and continued focus on cost control contributed to third quarter EPS near the high end of our guidance range. Compared to the same quarter in 2007 we have grown revenue in our core businesses by 14% while significantly reducing quarterly operating expenses."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $10 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2008.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.

Changes to Board of Directors
On November 10, 2008, we received the resignation of Timothy Chen as a member of our Board of Directors. His resignation was effective November 12, 2008.
On November 12, 2008, the Board of Directors elected Susan Whitney to the Board and elected her a member of the Boards Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  Ms. Whitney retired from IBM in 2007, where she most recently served as General Manager, IBM System x.
Upon her election to the Board, Ms. Whitney received an option to purchase 30,000 shares of our common stock under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. The option has a seven-year term, becomes exercisable in four equal annual installments and has an exercise price per share equal to the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.
Adoption of Policy on Recoupment of Incentive Compensation
On November 12, 2008, our Compensation Committee adopted a policy requiring our executive officers, if requested by the Compensation Committee, to repay or return covered payments in the event that we issue a material restatement of our financial statements, where the restatement is caused, in whole or in part, by the individuals intentional misconduct. covered payments means cash bonuses paid after the date of adoption of the policy and stock options, restricted stock units and any other equity-based awards.
The policy permits the committee to cancel specified equity awards and to recover the after-tax amount realized by a covered individual from bonus payments, specified stock sales and restricted stock unit vestings.
The Compensation Committee has the discretion to seek to recoup a different amount, if it believes it appropriate under the circumstances. The committee expects to require each of our executive officers to agree to the terms of this policy in the option agreement for the next option grant the officer receives.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
cc08-82
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced that it has revised its business outlook for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2008. LSI now projects revenues of $570 to $610 million. The previous business outlook, which was announced on October 22, 2008, projected revenues in the range of $670 million to $710 million.
MILPITAS, Calif., December 18, 2008 
The revised outlook reflects anticipated sales levels that are lower than previously expected due to the weakening global macroeconomic environment. LSI has already begun taking steps to reduce operating expenses as a result of continuing demand uncertainty and expects to maintain tight expense controls for the foreseeable future.
While our balance sheet remains strong, we are taking appropriate measures to adjust to current business conditions as well as an anticipated revenue decline in the first quarter of 2009 that we expect to be greater than typical seasonal patterns, said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. Our goal is to continue to drive positive operating cash flows going forward.
LSI expects to release its fourth quarter and full-year 2008 results on January 28, 2009.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 28, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:

Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
We monitor the recovery of goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our two reporting units are Semiconductor and Storage Systems. On January 16, 2009 in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, we determined that the current carrying value of goodwill and intangibles for our Semiconductor reporting unit was no longer recoverable as a result of declines in the market price of our common stock. We recorded an impairment charge of $541.6 million. We will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of this impairment.

Fourth quarter 2008 revenues were $610 million, an 18% decrease year-over-year compared to $741 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007, and down 15% sequentially compared to $714 million reported in the third quarter of 2008.
Fourth quarter 2008 GAAP* net loss was $606 million or 94 cents per share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $2.0 billion or $2.87 per share. Fourth quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to third quarter 2008 GAAP net income of $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share.

Fourth quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $41 million or 6 cents per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $94 million or 13 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $94 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end.
"Fourth quarter revenues were within our revised guidance range, with weakening demand for our semiconductor products partially offset by seasonally higher sales of storage systems," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "While we continue to execute well, we have taken aggressive steps to lower our operating expenses in light of the current business climate.
"Going forward, we intend to play offense by seeking to extend our competitive lead in key areas, increasing our design win momentum, and managing our cash well to position ourselves as a stronger player when economic conditions improve."
LSI recorded full-year 2008 revenues of $2.68 billion, a 3% increase compared to $2.60 billion in 2007. The company reported 2008 GAAP net loss of $622 million or 96 cents per share. Full-year 2008 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $905 million from special items, including a $542 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, $236 million in the amortization of acquisition-related items, $44 million of restructuring costs, and $72 million of stock-based compensation expense. Full-year 2008 GAAP results compare to full-year 2007 GAAP net loss of $2.49 billion or $3.87 per share.
Non-GAAP net income for 2008 was $283 million or 44 cents per diluted share compared to 2007 non-GAAP net income of $168 million or 26 cents per diluted share.
 
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "Despite challenging conditions in the fourth quarter, we delivered a 68% improvement in non-GAAP net income in 2008 compared to 2007 and generated strong positive operating cash flows. We ended the year with more than $1.1 billion in cash, and repurchased approximately $119 million of debt during the quarter."
Capital spending is projected to be around $13 million in the first quarter and approximately $50 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $20 million in the first quarter and approximately $85 million in total for 2009.

If LSI determines that it and/or an Affiliate will withhold or collect any Tax Obligations as a result of your option, you must make arrangements satisfactory to LSI to satisfy all withholding and/or collection requirements and you may not exercise this option until you do so. You acknowledge that you have the ultimate liability for any and all Tax Obligations imposed on you and that LSI and any Affiliate that employs you (a) make no representations or undertaking regarding treatment of those Tax Obligations; and (b) do not commit to take any action to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax Obligations. To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI and any Affiliate that employs you have the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines has not or cannot be satisfied through other means. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 8.
Tax Withholding and Payment Obligations
 
9. .  You agree that, without LSIs prior written consent, you will not solicit (or induce or encourage others to solicit) any employee of LSI or any Subsidiary to leave their employment with LSI or any Subsidiary. This agreement applies both while you are employed by LSI or any Subsidiary and for a period of 12 months after your employment with LSI or any Subsidiary ends, and is in addition to your separately enforceable obligations under existing intellectual property and non-disclosure agreements, and under common law. You and LSI agree that the precise amount of damages LSI will experience if you violate your agreement in the first sentence of this paragraph 9 would be impracticable or extremely difficult to calculate or prove, and that $125,000 (the Liquidated Damages) constitutes a best estimate of those damages for each employee solicited or induced.  You agree that, if you violate your agreement in the first sentence of this paragraph 9, for each employee solicited or induced, at LSI's election:  (i) you will pay the Liquidated Damages amount to LSI within 45 days of LSIs written request; or (ii) LSI may cancel any unexercised portion of this Option and/or any other options to purchase LSI Shares you hold, and you will pay to LSI any remaining portion of the Liquidated Damages amount within 45 days of LSIs written request. The value of any options that LSI so cancels may not exceed the Liquidated Damages amount multiplied by the number of employees solicited or induced. LSI will calculate that value on the cancellation date using the valuation methodology it then uses for financial reporting purposes.
Agreement Not To Solicit LSI Employees
 
10. .
Suspension of Exercisability
 
(a) If at any time LSI determines that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state, federal or foreign law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition of the purchase of Shares hereunder, this option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to LSI.  LSI shall make reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state, federal or foreign law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.
 
(b) LSI may designate times when you cannot exercise this option in connection with corporate events such as a stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification, spin-off, merger or change-in-control transaction. If the option is scheduled to expire during one of those periods, you will need to exercise the option before that period begins.
 
11. .  You will not have any of the rights of a stockholder of LSI in respect of any of the Shares issuable upon exercise of this option until those Shares are delivered to you or deposited in your account at LSIs designated broker.
No Rights of Stockholder

(b) LSI does not intend by granting this option to you to confer upon you the right to be selected to receive any future Award under the Plan.
 
13. .  Any notice to be given to LSI under this Agreement must be in writing and addressed to LSI Corporation, Attn: Stock Administration Department, Mailstop D-206, 1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035, or such other address as LSI may designate in writing.

Exhibit 10.3
 
 
 
 
 
On the grant date (the Grant Date) shown on the attached Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the Notice of Grant), LSI Corporation (LSI or the Company) granted you the number of Restricted Stock Units under the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan), indicated on the Notice of Grant. The Notice of Grant and this agreement collectively are referred to as the Agreement. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this agreement or the Notice of Grant have the same meaning as in the Plan.
 
 
1. . LSI has granted to you the number of restricted stock units indicated in the Notice of Grant.  We refer to the restricted stock units subject to this award as the Restricted Stock Units. When the Restricted Stock Units become payable, or vest, they will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings.
Grant
 
 
2. . Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest, you will have no right to payment of them. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, those Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation of LSI.
LSIs Obligation to Pay
 
 
3. . The Restricted Stock Units are scheduled to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on any date actually will vest only if you have not incurred a Termination of Service prior to that date and any performance goals required to be met have been met. Unless the Board determines otherwise, vesting will continue during any LSI-approved leave of absence.
Vesting Schedule
 
 
4. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to you in whole shares, subject to you satisfying any applicable tax withholding obligations. Subject to paragraph 8(b), any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid in shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case no later than the 15 day of the third month following the vesting date.
Payment after Vesting

Death
 
 
7. .
Withholding of Taxes
 
 
(a)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, you will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if you are a U.S. taxpayer. If you are a non-U.S. taxpayer, you will be subject to applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.
 
 
(b)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, LSI will withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay Tax Obligations determined by LSI to be applicable in connection with such vesting. If LSI determines Tax Obligations are applicable in connection with your Restricted Stock Units at any other time, LSI may, in its sole discretion, collect from you an amount equal to such Tax Obligations in any of the following ways: (i) by withholding a portion of the proceeds from your sale of the shares issued to you upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, (ii) by withholding, or having the Affiliate that employs you withhold, such amount from salary or other amounts payable to you, or (iii) requiring you to pay such amount to LSI.  LSI may require or otherwise allow you to make alternate arrangements to satisfy such Tax Obligations.
 
 
(c)  LSI will not withhold or issue any fractional shares.  LSI will not deliver shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to LSI have been made for the satisfaction of Tax Obligations.
 
 
(d)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of shares.  All Tax Obligations related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares delivered upon vesting are your sole responsibility. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to the withholding of shares and to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 7.
 
 
8. .
Committee Discretion
 
 
(a)  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of some or all of the Restricted Stock Units at any time. If so accelerated, those Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.  Subject to this paragraph 8, if the Committee accelerates the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will be made no later than the 15 day of the third month following the accelerated vesting date. However, if the Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then, to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, the payment of the accelerated portion of those Restricted Stock Units will be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in paragraph 3 (whether or not you remain employed by LSI or an Affiliate as of such date(s)), including any necessary delay under paragraph 8(b).
th
 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with your Termination of Service (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by LSI), other than due to death and if (x) you are a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such Termination of Service and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to you on or within the six (6) month period following your Termination of Service, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until at least six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of your Termination of Service, unless you die following your Termination of Service, in which case the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares to your estate or beneficiary as soon as practicable following your death.  It is the intent of this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units or shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply.  
,
 
 
9. . You will not have any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares deliverable hereunder until those shares have been delivered to you or deposited in your account at LSIs designated broker.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 29, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 5, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended April 5, 2009.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 29, 2009 
 
 
First quarter 2009 revenues were $482 million, a 27% decrease year-over-year compared to $661 million reported in the first quarter of 2008, and down 21% sequentially compared to $610 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2008.
First quarter 2009 GAAP* net loss was $104 million or 16 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. First quarter 2009 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $606 million or 94 cents per share. First quarter 2009 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $86 million from special items, consisting primarily of $42.7 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $25.2 million in net restructuring and other items and $18 million of stock-based compensation expense.
First quarter 2009 non-GAAP** net loss was $18 million or 3 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income of $64 million or 10 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $41 million or 6 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end.
"Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, our first quarter revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range with our storage semiconductor and networking businesses demonstrating strength late in the quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We have also significantly lowered our operating expenses while continuing to invest in key opportunities which position us to grow at above-market rates coming out of the downturn."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "Through a combination of effective cost controls and streamlining actions, operating expenses for the quarter came in below our expected range. Inventory levels were also sequentially down and sharply lower on a year-over-year basis, contributing to our continued balance sheet strength."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $50 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $20 million in the second quarter and approximately $90 million in total for 2009.

At our annual meeting of stockholders on May 14, 2009, our stockholders approved our amended Incentive Plan. Under that plan, we link participating employees' cash incentive compensation to the company's performance in a way intended to enable us to receive a federal income tax deduction for that compensation.  The principal changes to the plan were:
 
 
 
On May 15, 2009, all outstanding 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 of Agere Systems Inc. (the Notes) were called for redemption on June 15, 2009 at a redemption price of 100.43% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date.  As of May 15, 2009, $243.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes were outstanding.  The aggregate redemption price will be approximately $244.0 million, assuming that no holders of Notes convert their Notes into our common stock.  We will pay the redemption price of the Notes from cash on hand.
As a result of the redemption, we will incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million and realize non-cash income of approximately 1.6 million that will be reflected in our results for the quarterly period ended July 5, 2009.

At no time before the actual distribution of funds to any Participant under the Plan shall any Participant accrue any vested interest or right whatsoever under the Plan except as otherwise stated in this Plan.
10.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a separate arrangement between the Company and the Participant or the Committee may provide for a different timing of distribution that is exempt from or compliant with Section 409A.

Recently, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors reviewed the compensation of our chief financial officer, Mr. Bryon Look and the head of our semiconductor business, Mr. Jeffrey Richardson, each of whom assumed additional responsibilities in connection with a reorganization of our business early this year.  In addition to his role as the head of our finance organization, Mr. Look assumed responsibility for our public relations, marketing and investor relations organizations.  In addition to his role as the head of our networking, storage controller and custom silicon businesses, Mr. Richardson assumed responsibility for our business that makes integrated circuits for use in hard disk drives and tape drives. 
 
Noting these changes, as well as a comparison of their existing compensation to market data, the committee, on August 20, 2009, increased Mr. Look's base salary from $400,000 to $440,000 per year and increased Mr. Richardson's base salary from $400,000 to $475,000 per year, in each case effective August 24, 2009.  The Committee also increased the target bonus of Mr. Richardson to 100% of his base salary and the target bonus of Mr. Look to 75% of his base salary.  The company currently does not expect to pay bonuses for 2009.
 
 
 
On August 20, 2009, our Board of Directors considered the compensation of the outside directors and, noting that their total compensation, and particularly their equity compensation, appeared to be lower than the compensation paid by our peer group companies, the Board awarded each outside director an option to purchase 50,000 shares, effective August 20, 2009, with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of the company's stock on the grant date.

On October 28, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended October 4, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc09-81
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its third quarter ended October 4, 2009.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 28, 2009 
 
 
Third quarter 2009 revenues were $578 million, an 11% increase sequentially compared to $521 million reported in the second quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2009 revenues decreased 19% year over year compared to $714 million reported in the third quarter of 2008.
Third quarter 2009 GAAP* net income was $52 million or 8 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $61 million or 9 cents per share. Third quarter GAAP results included a $65 million tax benefit, or 10 cents per diluted share, primarily related to the settlement of a multi-year foreign tax audit. Third quarter 2009 GAAP results compare to third quarter 2008 GAAP net income of $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 GAAP net income included a net charge of $66 million from special items, consisting primarily of $43 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of stock-based compensation expense, $6.6 million in net restructuring and other items, and $1.7 million in write-down of investments.
Third quarter 2009 non-GAAP** net income was $119 million or 18 cents per diluted share compared to second quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Third quarter non-GAAP results included earnings of 10 cents per diluted share reflecting the above-mentioned tax benefit. Third quarter non-GAAP net income compares to third quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income of $94 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $907 million at quarter end.
"With the economy demonstrating signs that a modest recovery is underway, our third quarter revenues exceeded our guidance range, supported by healthy sequential growth across our businesses overall," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "As businesses resume spending on information technology, we are now poised to realize the benefits of the winning recipe we have worked to put in place over the last several years."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "We delivered a very solid third quarter, with improved profitability stemming from strong top-line growth, expanding gross margins across both our semiconductor and storage systems businesses, and continued focus on effectively managing our operating expenses. Operating cash flows were healthy at $69 million and our net cash position increased to $557 million."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $22 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $90 million in total for 2009.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 27, 2010, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $962 million at quarter end.

"With more than 80% of our revenues tied to enterprise technology spending, we are well positioned to benefit as this recovery gains strength going forward."
LSI recorded full-year 2009 revenues of $2.22 billion, a 17% decrease compared to $2.68 billion in 2008. The company reported 2009 GAAP net loss of $48 million or 7 cents per share.

Non-GAAP net income for 2009 was $232 million or 35 cents per diluted share compared to 2008 non-GAAP net income of $283 million or 44 cents per diluted share.
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "We demonstrated strong fourth quarter performance, with significant improvements in revenues, gross margin, operating income and cash flows. Our storage systems business achieved record quarterly revenues, growing 24% sequentially and contributing
 
to a second-half consisting of two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. We ended the year with nearly $1 billion in cash and short-term investments while our net cash position increased to $612 million."
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the first quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2010.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $25 million in the first quarter and approximately $100 million in total for 2010.

LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today updated its business outlook for the first quarter ending April 4, 2010 and has announced the authorization of a new share repurchase program.
MILPITAS, Calif., March 17, 2010

Exhibit 99.1
cc10-39
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended April 4, 2010.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 28, 2010 
 
 
First quarter 2010 revenues were $637 million, a 32% increase year-over-year compared to $482 million reported in the first quarter of 2009, and essentially flat sequentially compared to $638 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009.
First quarter 2010 GAAP* net income was $23 million or 3 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $104 million or 16 cents per share. First quarter GAAP results included a net tax benefit of $19 million primarily related to the expiration of statutes of limitations. First quarter 2010 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $65 million or 10 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2010 GAAP net income included a net charge of $70 million from special items, consisting primarily of $40 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense, $12 million of loss on write-down of equity securities, and $2 million of net restructuring and other items.
First quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income was $92 million or 14 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 non-GAAP net loss of $18 million or 3 cents per share. First quarter non-GAAP results also included the aforementioned net tax benefit of $19 million. Fourth quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income was $124 million or 18 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.0 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that it has completed the purchase of approximately 4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $26 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.
"Our strong first quarter results reflect an improving end demand environment as well as increasing operating leverage from the steps we have taken to transform our business over the past few years," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "Revenues were at the high end of our updated guidance range and well above typical seasonal patterns, further underscoring our confidence in our ability to grow faster than the markets we serve."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "First quarter revenues improved significantly on a year-over-year basis and were sequentially flat to the fourth quarter of 2009, offsetting the effects of normal seasonality. We delivered strong earnings performance relative to our upwardly revised guidance and generated solid operating cash flows of $106 million. Semiconductor revenues grew 9% sequentially, while our storage systems business achieved record first-quarter revenues."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2010.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $26 million in the second quarter and approximately $100 million in total for 2010.

At our annual meeting of stockholders on May 12, 2010, our stockholders approved our amended 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  Under that plan, we can award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and directors of the company.  The principal changes to the plan were:
Stockholder approval of the plan will also have the effect of extending the period during which incentive stock options can be granted to 10 years following stockholder approval of the plan.  Stockholder approval of the amended plan also will constitute re-approval of the plan and its material terms for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which will allow us to grant performance-based awards under the plan that we can deduct for tax purposes.
We held our annual meeting of stockholders on May 12, 2010.  At the meeting, the stockholders elected nine directors to serve for the ensuing year and until their successors are elected, ratified the audit committee's selection of our independent auditors for 2010, approved our amended 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and approved our amended Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

9.1.1

For the purposes of this Section 9.1, an Award will be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control:
 
(a)           the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares);
 
(b)           in the case of (i) an Option, (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Committee determines to pay cash, or (iii) a Restricted Stock Unit which the Committee can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by the holder of a Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); or
 
(c)           in the case of (i) an Option, (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right, or (iii) a Restricted Stock Unit, the common stock of the Successor Corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.
 
9.2
 
. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participants consent; provided, however, a non-substantive modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the Successor Corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.

On July 28, 2010, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended July 4, 2010. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.

Exhibit 99.1
cc10-54
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its second quarter ended July 4, 2010.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 28, 2010 
    Second quarter 2010 revenues of $639 million
    Second quarter 2010 GAAP* net income of 1 cent per diluted share
    Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income of 11 cents per diluted share
    Second quarter operating cash flows of $68 million
    Projected revenues of $625 million to $655 million
    GAAP* net (loss)/income in the range of ($0.03) to $0.06 cents per share
    Non-GAAP** net income in the range of $0.08 to $0.14 cents per share
 
 
Second quarter 2010 revenues were $639 million, a 23% increase year-over-year compared to $521 million reported in the second quarter of 2009, and compares to $637 million reported in the first quarter of 2010.
Second quarter 2010 GAAP* net income was $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $61 million or 9 cents per share. Second quarter 2010 GAAP results compare to first quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $23 million or 3 cents per diluted share. First quarter GAAP results included a net tax benefit of $19 million. Second quarter 2010 GAAP net income included a net charge of $64 million from special items, consisting primarily of $40 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $18 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $5 million of net restructuring and other items.
Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income was $71 million or 11 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. First quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income was $92 million or 14 cents per diluted share. First quarter non-GAAP results also included the aforementioned net tax benefit of $19 million.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $670 million at quarter end. During the quarter, LSI repaid $350 million of outstanding convertible notes, becoming debt free. The company also completed second-quarter purchases of approximately 10 million shares of its common stock for approximately $55 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.
"Despite some isolated customer inventory adjustments late in the quarter that modestly affected our sequential revenue growth, tight operating expense control and higher gross margins enabled us to deliver a solid bottom-line performance," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "While improving end market demand for enterprise IT products continues to bode well for us, our outlook for the third quarter is one of tempered optimism as macro-economic conditions appear to be somewhat fluid at the present time."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "We delivered sound financial results in the second quarter. First-half operating cash flows nearly tripled from the year-ago period while net cash improved by 28% on the same basis. We also repaid all our remaining debt and continued to purchase shares of the company's common stock through our previously announced share repurchase program."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the third quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2010.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $26 million in the third quarter and approximately $104 million in total for 2010.
LSI Conference Call Information
LSI will hold a conference call today at 2 p.m. PDT to discuss second quarter financial results and the third quarter 2010 business outlook. Internet users can access the conference call at . Subsequent to the conference call, a replay will be available at the same web address.

Third quarter 2010 revenues were $629 million, a 9% increase year-over-year compared to $578 million reported in the third quarter of 2009, and compares to $639 million reported in the second quarter of 2010.
Third quarter 2010 GAAP* net income was $23 million or 4 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $52 million or 8 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 GAAP results included a tax benefit of $65 million, or 10 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2010 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Third quarter 2010 GAAP net income included a net charge of $56 million from special items, consisting primarily of $40 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $17 million of stock-based compensation expense, $4 million of net restructuring and other items, and $5 million of gain on the sale of securities.
Third quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income was $79 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income of $119 million or 18 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 non-GAAP results included earnings of 10 cents per diluted share reflecting the above-mentioned tax benefit. Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income was $71 million or 11 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $601 million at quarter end. The company completed third-quarter purchases of approximately 32 million shares of its common stock for approximately $137 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has purchased approximately 46 million shares of its common stock for approximately $218 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.
"Healthy growth in our storage systems business coupled with strong execution contributed to solid operating performance, with net income near the high end of our guidance range, despite some end-market softness and related customer inventory adjustments that affected sequential revenues," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "While end-market demand challenges could continue, we expect to benefit from new product ramps in 2011 as several of our design wins with top-tier storage and networking customers transition to production."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "Our third quarter results reflect a continuing, strong focus on achieving our business model targets. Gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range, showing solid quarterly expansion and much improvement versus year-ago levels, while operating margins continued to grow on a sequential basis and were sharply higher year over year. Operating cash flows grew 21% sequentially to $82 million and were $256 million on a year-to-date basis, approximately double the $128 million recorded in the same period last year."
 
LSI Fourth Quarter 2010 Business Outlook

Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be effective if delivered by electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, which consent may be express or, if permitted under and in accordance with applicable law, implied.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.

fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

-4-
 
 
The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.

The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

At a stockholders meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholders intention to cumulate votes.  If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) su ch holder of stock would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such holders shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by such holder, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as the holder may see fit.
 
2.10
 
WAIVER OF NOTICE
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
 
-5-
 
 
special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
 
2.11
 
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.  If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
 
(a)
 
Actions other than Written Consent.  For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
(b)
 
Action by Written Consent.  In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. &# 160;The board of directors may, at any time within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)), which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the corporate secretary.  Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.   Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.

2.13
 
PROXIES
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic representation or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
2.14
 
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
 
The corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) during ordinary business hours, at the corporations principal place of business; or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the cor poration may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 
2.15
 
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one or three.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Such inspector(s) shall perform such duties as may be required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

THIRD PARTY ACTIONS
 
The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a ) (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (each person holding any such office or acting in any such capacity, an ), against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection

with such Proceeding if such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, or, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was lawful.
 
6.2
 
ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION
 
The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting as an Indemnitee, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
6.3
 
SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE
 
To the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
 
6.4
 
DETERMINATION OF CONDUCT
 
Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.  To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.  Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding
 
-20-
 
 
sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as follows:  (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of dir ectors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors.  If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
 
6.5
 
RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
 
If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnif y the claimant for the amount claimed.  The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section.  The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
 
 
-21-
 
 
 
6.6
 
PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
 
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Indemnitee who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Indemnitee, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Indemnitee's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corpora tion or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
 
6.7
 
INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
6.8
 
INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION
 
The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnitee against any liability asserted against, or incurred by, such person by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 26, 2011, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
 
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its external storage systems business to NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP) for $480 million in cash. The company also announced today that its board of directors has authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $750 million.
MILPITAS, Calif., March 9, 2011 
The company is emerging from a multi-year investment cycle which has significantly increased the opportunities and potential of its core semiconductor business. The strategic decision to divest the external storage systems business was based on the companys expectation that long-term shareholder value can be maximized by becoming a pure-play semiconductor company.
Were excited by the opportunities we have been pursuing in our semiconductor business and are well positioned at the forefront of a strong pipeline of design win ramps that we expect to drive top line growth, said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. Going forward as a pure-play storage and networking semiconductor company, we believe we can accelerate the achievement of our current business model, establish a richer business model target, and deliver greater long-term shareholder value.
Under terms of the agreement, NetApp will purchase substantially all the assets of the LSI external storage systems business, which develops and delivers Engenio external storage systems products and technology to a wide range of partners that provide storage solutions to end customers. The business being purchased generated revenues of $705 million in 2010.
The LSI RAID adapter business, which develops LSI MegaRAID and 3ware storage controllers and software for direct-attached storage environments, will remain with LSI.
Upon closing, most LSI external storage systems employees are expected to join NetApp, a global provider of storage and data management solutions.
NetApp will build upon the success of the Engenio storage platform and OEM business model to expand our total addressable market and extend our market reach, said Tom Georgens, NetApp president and CEO. Were excited about the talented team that will join NetApp and the valuable OEM partner relationships were committed to supporting and making successful.
Talwalkar added, As the market requirements for external storage systems continue to trend toward more comprehensive solutions and offerings, greater investment levels are required to enable additional growth opportunities. We believe that NetApp is well positioned to provide the needed technologies and scale to grow the external storage systems business and better serve our customers going forward.
About the Transaction
As a result of the sale, LSI expects to eliminate $35 million to $40 million per quarter of operating expenses upon closing of the transaction.
LSI expects the combined effect of the transaction, its associated expense reduction, the new stock repurchase program and anticipated strong revenue growth in its semiconductor business going forward to be slightly dilutive to 2011 earnings per share (EPS) and neutral to accretive to 2012 EPS.
The company does not expect to incur any material tax obligations in connection with the transaction and expects to provide additional financial information after closing the transaction.
The transaction is expected to close in approximately 60 days, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals including those required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
LSI Stock Repurchase Program
Stock repurchases under the newly authorized program are expected to be funded from the proceeds of the sale of the external storage systems business, available cash and short-term investments.
Our business is tracking consistent with the guidance we provided in January, and were confident that the steps we are taking today will position us to achieve our business model operating margin target by the end of 2011, said Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer. This new repurchase program underscores our belief in the future earnings power of LSI as a pure-play semiconductor company.
LSI Conference Call Information
LSI will hold a conference call today at 5 p.m. EST to discuss the transaction. Internet users can access the conference call at . Subsequent to the conference call, a replay will be available at the same web address.

On 
April 19, 2011, we appointed D. Jeffrey Richardson, age 46, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Richardson had been the leader of our Semiconductor Solutions Group since January 2009. From April 2007 through January 2009, he led our Network and Storage Products Group, which included our Networking, Custom and Storage Interfaces semiconductor businesses. From September 2005 through April 2007, he was the leader of our Custom Solutions Group, and from June 2005 through September 2005, he led our Corporate Strategy function. From 1992 through June 2005, he held a variety of management positions at Intel Corporation, a microprocessor manufacturer.
 
On March 9, 2011, we announced that we had agreed to sell our external storage business to NetApp, Inc. Philip Bullinger, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Engenio Storage Group, currently leads that business for us. Mr. Bullinger played a key role for us in the events leading up to the signing of the agreement with NetApp. To reward him for his efforts, and to reward him for leading the business through the critical period between signing the agreement and completing the sale, we have agreed to pay him a special bonus of $212,500 following the completion of the sale, if he remains with LSI and if, between April 15, 2011 and the closing of the sale, the external storage systems business continues to meet performance goals set by our Chief Executive Officer.
We expect that Mr. Bullinger will not join NetApp after the sale is completed. We also expect that we will not have a position at LSI for Mr. Bullinger that we and Mr. Bullinger will each find acceptable. Accordingly, on April 15, 2011, we entered into an agreement with him pursuant to which he will leave LSI on May 13, 2011, if the sale has been completed, and he will be eligible for benefits under our Severance Policy for Executive Officers, including a lump sum payment from us of $425,000.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 27, 2011, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 3, 2011. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc11-23
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended April 3, 2011.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 27, 2011 
On March 9, 2011, LSI entered into a definitive agreement to sell its external storage systems business to NetApp, Inc. The transaction is expected to be completed in May, 2011, and the financial results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements. The company's guidance for the first quarter included expected financial results for the external storage systems business, therefore financial measures including and excluding this business have been provided in this news release.
 
 
First quarter 2011 revenues from continuing operations were $473 million, essentially flat year over year compared to $473 million generated from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2010, and compared to $471 million generated from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Including results from discontinued operations, first quarter 2011 revenues would have been $629 million, a 1% decrease year over year compared to $637 million reported in the first quarter of 2010, and compared to $664 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010.
First quarter 2011 GAAP* income from continuing operations was $19 million or 3 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 GAAP income from continuing operations of $14 million or 2 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2011 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2010 GAAP income from continuing operations of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. First quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations included a net charge of $47 million from special items, consisting primarily of $30 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $3 million of net restructuring and other items.
First quarter 2011 GAAP net income was $10 million or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $23 million or 3 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2011 GAAP net income compares to fourth quarter 2010 GAAP net loss of $13 million or 2 cents per share.
First quarter 2011 non-GAAP** income from continuing operations was $65 million or 10 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $78 million or 12 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $53 million or 8 cents per diluted share.
First quarter 2011 non-GAAP net income was $82 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income of $92 million or 14 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income was $90 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $682 million at quarter end. The company completed first-quarter purchases of approximately 15 million shares of its common stock for approximately $97 million.
"Our first quarter revenues were strong, bolstered by market share gains with key hard disk drive system-on-chip customers that partially offset normal seasonal
 
patterns," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "I'm also pleased with our execution in the quarter, which contributed to both solid gross margin performance and effective operating expense control. We're now well positioned to achieve our current business model and to establish a new, richer business model as we transition to becoming a leading, pure-play provider of semiconductors that enable growing storage and networking applications."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "First-quarter operating cash flows of $108 million were healthy while our balance sheet remained strong and debt free. Our net cash position increased to $682 million after purchasing nearly 15 million shares of our common stock during the quarter."
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the second quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2011.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $17 million in the second quarter and approximately $75 million in total for 2011.

1. Basis of Presentation
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the respective periods presented are based on the historical audited financial statements of LSI Corporation (the "Company") contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 after giving effect to the sale of its external storage systems business (the "Transaction"), which was completed on May 6, 2011, and using the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 is presented as if the Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented as if the Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2008 and do not assume interest income on the cash proceeds.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are based upon available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances and are prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the Transaction. You should read this information in conjunction with the Company's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and for the years ended December 2010, 2009 and 2008, included in the LSI annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been provided for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been achieved had the Transaction occurred as of or for the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of the Company's future operating results or financial position.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the anticipated effects of additional restructuring charges related to severance and certain contractual obligations because estimates of these potential costs cannot be quantified at this time.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 27, 2011, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended July 3, 2011. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:

We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.

Exhibit 99.1
 
cc11-39/C1119
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its second quarter ended July 3, 2011.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 27, 2011 
On May 6, 2011, LSI completed the sale of its external storage systems business to NetApp. The financial results of the external systems business have been classified as discontinued operations in LSI's financial statements. Our ongoing business is referred to as "continuing operations."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Our strong execution in the second quarter and guidance for the third quarter, which represents 10 percent sequential revenue growth at the mid-point, reflect share gains and program ramps at key customers across multiple businesses," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO. "LSI is now entering an exciting new phase in our evolution. With our transformation complete, we are well positioned to drive above-market growth, generate greater profitability and increase shareholder value."
Second quarter 2011 revenues from continuing operations were $501 million, above the high end of guidance, compared to $473 million generated from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2010, and compared to $473 million generated from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011.
Second quarter 2011 GAAP* income from continuing operations was $28 million or 5 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP income from continuing operations of $3 million or break-even per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 GAAP results compare to first quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations of $19 million or 3 cents per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations included a net charge of $31 million from special items, consisting primarily of $29 million of amortization of acquisition-related items and $14 million of stock-based compensation expense, offset by an $11 million credit for net restructuring and other items.
Second quarter 2011 GAAP net income was $294 million or 48 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 GAAP net income includes a gain of $260 million or 43 cents per diluted share related to the sale of the external storage systems business to NetApp. Second quarter 2011 GAAP net income compares to first quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $10 million or 2 cents per diluted share.
Second quarter 2011 non-GAAP** income from continuing operations was $60 million or 10 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $61 million or 9 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $65 million or 10 cents per diluted share.
Second quarter 2011 non-GAAP net income was $79 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income of $71 million or 11 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2011 non-GAAP net income was $82 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $907 million at quarter end. The company completed second-quarter purchases of approximately 42 million shares of its common stock for approximately $300 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has purchased approximately 56 million shares of its common stock for approximately $397 million under its $750 million share repurchase program.
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "In addition to exceeding the high end of our revenue guidance in the second quarter, we were active in buying back stock and have repurchased 56 million shares year to date. We remain committed to driving earnings growth and getting to our target business model. Our guidance implies strong operating margin expansion in the third quarter, demonstrating the earnings leverage we have created."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the third quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2011.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $16 million in the third quarter and approximately $75 million in total for 2011.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 26, 2011, LSI Corporation ("LSI") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Autobahn Acquisition Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of LSI, SandForce, Inc. ("SandForce") and Shareholder Representative Services LLC ("SRS") as Stockholder Representative (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into SandForce, with SandForce continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of LSI (the "Merger").
Under the agreement, LSI expects to pay approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed, and assume approximately $48 million of unvested SandForce Options and restricted shares held by SandForce employees.
At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of SandForce capital stock (other than any shares of common stock that are unvested, shares owned by SandForce as treasury stock, shares owned by LSI and shares exercising dissenters' rights) will be converted into the right to receive cash. Each share of unvested SandForce common stock will be exchanged for unvested common stock of LSI. All shares of SandForce capital stock owned by SandForce as treasury stock or by LSI will be cancelled without any right to receive any consideration. Awards of restricted stock units settleable in shares of SandForce capital stock will be assumed by LSI and become settleable, in accordance with their existing terms, in shares of LSI. Options to acquire shares of capital stock of SandForce ("SandForce Options") that are unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by employees will be assumed by LSI and become options exercisable for shares of LSI, in accordance with their existing vesting schedules and other terms. All other SandForce Options will, to the extent not vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will vest and become exercisable and, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, be cashed out for a portion of the aggregate merger consideration described below. In addition, LSI will grant restricted stock units to certain non-U.S. based individuals working for SandForce who will become employees of LSI. Warrants to acquire capital stock of SandForce, if not exercised prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled.
The aggregate merger consideration that will be used to determine the price per share payable for outstanding SandForce capital stock entitled to receive cash in the Merger is an amount equal to (i) the sum of (x) $400,000,000, (y) the aggregate exercise price of all SandForce Options that are outstanding and unexercised as of October 26, 2011 (other than SandForce Options that are terminated after October 26, 2011 and prior to the Effective Time without having been exercised, and other than SandForce Options that are net-exercised following October 26, 2011 and prior to the Effective Time), and (z) the aggregate exercise price of all warrants to purchase SandForce capital stock ("SandForce Warrants") that are outstanding and unexercised as of October 26, 2011 (other than SandForce Warrants that are terminated following October 26, 2011 and prior to the Effective Time without having been exercised), less (ii) the sum of (x) all third party fees and expenses incurred by SandForce in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (y) all of SandForce's indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
LSI will deduct approximately 10% of the cash merger consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to be held in escrow as security for indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement and $400,000 to be made available for reimbursement of the expenses of SRS.
The Merger and the Merger Agreement have been approved by the board of directors of each of LSI and SandForce, and by the requisite vote of the SandForce stockholders. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and a requirement that holders of not more than 5% of the fully diluted share capital of SandForce continue to have a right to exercise appraisal or dissenter's rights. The Merger is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2012.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of LSI and SandForce, covenants regarding the operation of SandForce's business prior to the closing date, and provisions regarding indemnification in favor of LSI. The Merger Agreement provides customary termination rights for both LSI and SandForce.

The acquisition greatly enhances LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing server and storage PCIe flash adapter market, where the WarpDrive family of products from LSI already uses SandForce flash storage processors. The complementary combination of LSI's custom capability and SandForce's standard product offering propels LSI into an industry-leading position in the rapidly growing, high-volume flash storage processor market space for ultrabook, notebook and enterprise SSD and flash solutions.
"Flash-based solutions are critical for accelerating application performance in servers, storage and client devices," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "Adding SandForce's technology to LSI's broad storage portfolio is consistent with our mission to accelerate storage and networking. The acquisition represents a significant, rapidly growing market opportunity for LSI over the next several years."
Michael Raam, SandForce president and CEO, said, "The combination of SandForce and LSI allows us to deliver differentiated solutions in the PCIe flash adapter segment by tightly integrating flash memory and management. In addition, leveraging our flash storage processors with LSI's comprehensive IP portfolio and leading-edge silicon design platforms will lead to innovative solutions."
The transaction is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2012 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon closing, the SandForce team will become part of LSI's newly formed Flash Components Division, with Raam as general manager.
LSI expects the acquisition to be neutral to non-GAAP* earnings per share in 2012. The company will provide further details during its conference call at 2 p.m. PDT today and discuss third quarter results and the fourth quarter 2011 business outlook.
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current opinions and estimates of management. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition, the successful consummation of the acquisition; our ability to successfully integrate and manage the SandForce business and retain its key employees; our ability to achieve anticipated synergies and to develop integrated new products following our acquisition of SandForce; our ability to eliminate costs related to the external storage systems business that we sold to NetApp; our ability to repurchase our common stock at prices we believe to be advantageous; the impact of the recent flooding in Thailand; our reliance on major customers and suppliers; our ability to keep up with rapid technological change; our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets; fluctuations in the timing and volumes of customer demand; the unavailability of appropriate levels of manufacturing capacity; and general industry and macro-economic conditions. For additional information, see the documents filed by LSI with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically the risk factors set forth in the company's most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. LSI disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

(b)
 
Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be effective if delivered by electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, which consent may be express or, if permitted under and in accordance with applicable law, implied.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability actually becomes known to the corporate secretary or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

Any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
 
(d)
 
Whenever notice is required to be given, under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a
 
 
 
-3-
 
 
certificate under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
2.7
 
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any (and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person at such adjourned meeting), thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

-4-
 
 
any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors.  In the absence of the corporate secretary, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
 
The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
 
2.9
 
VOTING
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
 
Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
 
At a stockholders meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholders intention to cumulate votes.  If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) such holder of stock would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such holders shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by such holder, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as the holder may see fit.
 
2.10
 
WAIVER OF NOTICE
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
 
 
 
-5-
 
 
meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
 
2.11
 
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.  If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
 
(a)
 
Actions other than Written Consent.  For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
 
 
-6-
 
 
 
(b)
 
Action by Written Consent.  In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date.  The board of directors may, at any time within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)), which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the corporate secretary.  Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this
 
 
 
-7-
 
 
Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
 
2.13
 
PROXIES
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic representation or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
2.14
 
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
 
The corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) during ordinary business hours, at the corporations principal place of business; or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 
2.15
 
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one or three.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Such inspector(s) shall perform such duties as may be required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

THIRD PARTY ACTIONS
 
The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a ) (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (each person holding any such office or acting in any such capacity, an ), against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with such Proceeding if such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION
 
The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
 
-22-
 
 
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting as an Indemnitee, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
6.3
 
SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE
 
To the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
 
6.4
 
DETERMINATION OF CONDUCT
 
Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.  To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.  Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as follows:  (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the
 
 
 
-23-
 
 
board of directors.  If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
 
6.5
 
RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
 
If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.  The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section.  The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
 
 
6.6
 
PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
 
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Indemnitee who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Indemnitee, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Indemnitee's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
 
 
 
-24-
 
 
 
6.7
 
INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
6.8
 
INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION
 
The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnitee against any liability asserted against, or incurred by, such person by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.

  Any cash severance payment (other than COBRA reimbursements) to which a Participant becomes entitled hereunder shall be made in installments either in (i) 12 equal monthly installments (payable on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the applicable month) commencing with the month following a Participants Qualifying Separation, provided that if the Release has not become effective and irrevocable by a scheduled payment date, the payment for such date shall not be paid on that date and instead shall accrue and become payable on the first monthly payment date following the date that the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (ii) the maximum amount of equal monthly installments less than 12 (if necessary) (payable on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the applicable month) commencing with the month following a Participants Qualifying Separation, provided that if the Release has not become effective and irrevocable by a scheduled payment date, the payment for such date shall not be paid on that date and instead shall accrue and become payable on the first monthly payment date following the date that the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, in each case (i) and (ii) to ensure that all such payments end on a date that is no later than March 15th of the year following the year after which a Participants Qualifying Separation occurred such that any such payment shall come within the short term deferral rule of Section 409A.
Timing of Cash Payments.
 
Each payment or benefit under this Policy is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that this Policy and the payment of all benefits hereunder be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A under the "" exemption, or to otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A, so that none of the payments and benefits to be provided will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be exempt or so comply.
Section 409A.  
short-term deferral
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if severance payment or benefits payable hereunder are 
deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then such severance will be paid on, or, in the case of installments, will not commence until, the 60 day following a Participants Qualifying Separation, or, if later, such time as required by the next paragraph, and except as required by the next paragraph, any installment or other payment or benefit accrued during such 60 day period will be paid on the 60th day

If an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or if shares of Stock are acquired upon the exercise of an Award subject to a Company repurchase option and are repurchased by the Company at the Participants exercise or purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of such Award or such repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any such time as the offer and sale of securities pursuant to the Plan is subject to compliance with Section 260.140.45 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations (), the total number of shares of Stock issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Awards (together with options outstanding under any other stock plan of the Company) and the total number of shares provided for under any stock bonus or similar plan of the Company shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) (or such other higher percentage limitation as may be approved by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 260.140.45) of the then outstanding shares of the Company as calculated in accordance with the conditions and exclusions of Section 260.140.45.

For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.  If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Awards are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another corporation (the ), the Board may unilaterally amend the outstanding Awards to provide that such Awards are for New Shares.  In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise or purchase price per share of, the outstanding Awards shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Board, in its discretion.  Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and the exercise price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  In no event may the exercise price of any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Award.  Such adjustments shall be determined by the Board, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.

  To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portions of such options which exceed such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 5.3, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to provide for a different limitation from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.

The Board may, in its sole discretion, provide in any Award Agreement or, in the event of a Change in Control, may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting in connection with such Change in Control of any or all outstanding Awards and shares acquired upon the exercise thereof upon such conditions, including termination of the Participants Service prior to, upon, or following such Change in Control, and to such extent as the Board shall determine.
Accelerated Vesting
 
(b)
 
.  In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the ), may, without the consent of any Participant, assume or continue the Companys rights and obligations under each or any Award or portion thereof outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control or substitute for each or any such outstanding Award or portion thereof a substantially equivalent award for the Acquirors stock.  For purposes of this Section, if so determined by the Board in its discretion, an Award shall be deemed assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, for each share of Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, other securities or property or a combination thereof) to which a holder of a share of Stock on the effective date of the Change in Control was entitled; provided, however, that if such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiror, the Board may, with the consent of the Acquiror, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award, for each share of Stock subject to the Award, to consist solely of common stock of the Acquiror equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control.  If any portion of such consideration may be received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control on a contingent or delayed basis, the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine such Fair Market Value per share as of the time of the Change in Control on the basis of the Boards good faith estimate of the present value of the probable future payment of such consideration.  Any Award or portion thereof which is neither assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of an Award prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement evidencing such Award except as otherwise provided in such Award Agreement.

If any portion of such consideration may be received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control on a contingent or delayed basis, the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine such Fair Market Value per share as of the time of the Change in Control on the basis of the Boards good faith estimate of the present value of the probable future payment of such consideration.  In the event such determination is made by the Board, the Spread (reduced by applicable withholding taxes, if any) shall be paid to Participants in respect of their canceled Awards as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control and in respect of the unvested portion of their canceled Awards in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Awards as in effect prior to the Change in Control.

  To aid the Participant in making any election called for under Section 9.2(a), no later than the date of the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in an excess parachute payment to the Participant as described in Section 9.2(a), the Company shall request a determination in writing by independent public accountants selected by the Company (the ).  As soon as practicable thereafter, the Accountants shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  For the purposes of such determination, the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make their required determination.

Compliance with Securities Law
 
The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Awards shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities.  Awards may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition, no Award may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Award be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Companys legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the exercise of any Award, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

On January 25, 2012, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.

MILPITAS, Calif., January 25, 2012 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
First Quarter 2012 Business Outlook
 
 
 
 
"Our growth last year in a challenging macro environment and our guidance for the first quarter of 2012 demonstrate the results of our ongoing strategic focus on delivering semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking applications," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO. "We enter 2012 building on strong business momentum and are accelerating our revenue growth with share gains and new design wins at key customers and in critical markets such as mega datacenters, cloud computing, mobile networks and flash storage."
Fourth quarter 2011 revenues from continuing operations were $523 million, in line with guidance, compared to $471 million generated from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, and compared to $547 million generated from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2011.
Fourth quarter 2011 GAAP* income from continuing operations was $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2010 GAAP income from continuing operations of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Third quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations was $32 million or 5 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations included a net charge of $62 million from special items, consisting primarily of approximately $29 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $21 million of net restructuring and other items. Fourth quarter 2011 GAAP results from continuing operations also included a $9 million net tax benefit, or 2 cents per diluted share, primarily related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and other non-cash tax items.
Fourth quarter 2011 GAAP net loss was $2 million or 0 cents per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2010 GAAP net loss of $13 million or 2 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2011 GAAP net income was $29 million or 5 cents per diluted share.

Fourth quarter 2011 non-GAAP results included a $9 million net tax benefit, or 2 cents per diluted share, primarily related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and other non-cash tax items. Third quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $83 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Fourth quarter 2011 non-GAAP net income was $60 million or 10 cents per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income of $90 million or 14 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2011 non-GAAP net income was $83 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $935 million at quarter end. The company completed fourth-quarter purchases of approximately 5 million shares of its common stock for approximately $27 million. In 2011, the company purchased approximately 72 million shares of its common stock for approximately $499 million under its $750 million share repurchase program.
LSI recorded full-year 2011 revenues from continuing operations of $2.04 billion, a 9.3% increase compared to $1.87 billion in 2010. The company reported 2011 GAAP net income of $331 million or 55 cents per diluted share. Full-year 2011 GAAP results compare to full-year 2010 GAAP net income of $40 million or 6 cents per share.
Full-year 2011 GAAP net income included a net charge of $191 million in special items from continuing operations, consisting primarily of $116 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $51 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $24 million of restructuring costs and other items. Full-year 2011 GAAP net income also included $241 million of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, which included a gain of $260 million related to the sale of the external storage systems business.
Non-GAAP net income for 2011 was $303 million or 50 cents per diluted share, compared to 2010 non-GAAP net income of $333 million or 52 cents per diluted share.
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "We remain focused on driving improvements to operating margins. The combination of share gains, new product cycles, and continued expense control are expected to drive increased profitability levels going forward."

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current opinions and estimates of management. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause LSI's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully integrate and manage the SandForce business and retain its key employees; our ability to achieve anticipated synergies and to develop integrated new products following our acquisition of SandForce; our ability to eliminate costs related to the external storage systems business that we sold in 2011; our ability to repurchase our common stock at prices we believe to be advantageous; the impact of the recent flooding in Thailand; our reliance on major customers and suppliers; our ability to keep up with rapid technological change; our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets; fluctuations in the timing and volumes of customer demand; the unavailability of appropriate levels of manufacturing capacity; and general industry and macro-economic conditions. For additional information, see the documents filed by LSI with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically the risk factors set forth in the company's most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.

On March 14, 2012, LSI Corporation issued a news release updating its guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Non-GAAP income tax expense/benefit also is adjusted for the additional amount of tax expense or benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results in the calculation of its tax liability. For the quarter ended April 1, 2012, we expect non-GAAP tax expense to exclude a one-time benefit related to the release of valuation allowance resulting from the net deferred tax liabilities created from the acquisition of SandForce.
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share.

NEWS RELEASE
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today updated its business outlook for the first quarter ending April 1, 2012, reflecting a stronger than expected hard disk drive market recovery and ramp of flash-based products. LSI executives will provide additional details in an analyst meeting today, March 14, in New York City.
MILPITAS, Calif., March 14, 2012 
 
 
Updated First Quarter 2012 Business Outlook
 
Income from continuing operations per share:
1,4,5
 
GAAP                                                      In the range of $0.06 to $0.10 per share
2
 
Non-GAAP                                             In the range of $0.12 to $0.16 per share
3
 
 
We are benefiting from better than expected strength in the hard disk drive market in the quarter as our team has done a great job working with our customers to meet this additional demand, said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO. This revised guidance reflects strength in our hard disk drive business as well as upside in our projections for our flash-based products.
 
 
On May 6, 2011, LSI completed the sale of its external storage systems business. The financial results of the external storage systems business have been classified as discontinued operations in LSIs financial statements. Our ongoing business is referred to as continuing operations.
1
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
2
Excludes goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, purchase accounting effect on inventory, restructuring of operations and other items, net, and gain/loss on sale/write-down of investments. It also excludes the income tax effect associated with the above-mentioned items and the tax benefit discussed in note 5. It also excludes, in the case of non-GAAP net income, gain from the sale of the external storage systems business.
3
 
 
 
Revised net income ranges reflect the change in share count from approximately 575 million shares to 590 million shares. The change in share count is driven by the increase in our stock price, which increases the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock unit awards included in the diluted share count calculation.
4
The company has not yet finalized the allocation of the purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the recently completed acquisition of SandForce. However, the company expects that in accounting for the SandForce purchase, it will recognize a one-time tax benefit of approximately $41.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 for GAAP purposes only. This tax benefit is due to the release of a valuation allowance resulting from the net deferred tax liabilities created from the acquisition, and will be excluded from our non-GAAP results.

Updated First Quarter 2012 Business Outlook Detail
The change in share count is driven by the increase in our stock price, which increases the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock unit awards included in the diluted share count calculation.

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 25, 2012, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 1, 2012. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Second Quarter 2012 Business Outlook
 
 
 
 
"Our performance in the first quarter demonstrates the positive results of our multi-year growth strategy and our ability to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. The significant revenue growth was driven by better-than-expected growth in our HDD business, strength in our new SandForce flash business and contribution from various new product cycles," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and CEO. "Going forward, LSI is firmly established as a central player in some of the most critical growth trends in computing, including cloud, Big Data, mobile networking and flash, with products that are bringing exciting new levels of speed and productivity to our customers."
First quarter 2012 revenues from continuing operations were $622 million, above the high end of updated guidance, compared to $473 million generated from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to $523 million generated from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011.
First quarter 2012 GAAP** income from continuing operations was $75 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations of $19 million or 3 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2011 GAAP income from continuing operations was $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2012 GAAP income from continuing operations included a net charge of $42 million from special items, consisting primarily of approximately $31 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of net restructuring and other items, $14 million of purchase accounting effect on inventory, a $43 million favorable income tax effect and a $6 million gain on remeasurement of a pre-acquisition equity interest to fair value.
First quarter 2012 non-GAAP*** income from continuing operations was $117 million or 20 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $65 million or 10 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $73 million or 13 cents per diluted share.

"In the first quarter, LSI delivered double-digit revenue growth and demonstrated significant progress towards our business model and non-GAAP operating margin target," said Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer. "Year over year, our revenues grew 32% and non-GAAP income from operations increased 80%."
LSI 2Q2012 Business Outlook for Continuing Operations
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the second quarter and approximately $125 million in total for 2012.

Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares, the total number of Shares subject to the portion of the Award so exercised, whether or not actually issued pursuant to such exercise, will cease to be available under the Plan. Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan pursuant to any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future Awards; provided, however, that if unvested Shares of Restricted Stockor Restricted Stock Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited, such Shares will become available for future Awards.  Shares used to pay the taxes associated with, and/or Exercise Price of, an Award will not become available for future Awards.  To the extent an Award is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, and subject to adjustment provided in Section 4.3, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will be 25,000,000 Shares.

as the Company may specify from time to time. The notice shall be given in the form and manner specified by the Company from time to time.
 
Upon the exercise of any Option, the Exercise Price shall be payable to the Company in full in cash or its equivalent. The Committee, in its sole discretion, also may permit exercise (a) by tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Exercise Price, or (b) by any other means which the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to both provide legal consideration for the Shares, and to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan.

.  In the event of a merger Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the
Change in Control
of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity or a
 
-14-
 
 
Committee determines, which may include that each Award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation (the Successor Corporation).  The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the transaction.
 
9.1.1
 
In the event that the Successor Corporation does not assume or substitute for a Participants Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are part of the Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that are part of the Award will lapse, and, if the Award has performance-based vesting, all Performance Goals or other performance-based vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions will be deemed met.  In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Committee will notify the Participant in writing or electronically (which notice may be in the form of a notice on the Companys Intranet or notice to any e-mail or postal address maintained by the Companys Stock Administration Department for the Participant) that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
9.1.2
 
For the purposes of this Section 9.1, an Award will be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control:
 
(a)           the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares);
 
(b)           in the case of (i) an Option, (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Committee determines to pay cash, or (iii) a Restricted Stock Unit which the Committee can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by the holder of a Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); or
 
(c)           in the case of (i) an Option, (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right, or (iii) a Restricted Stock Unit, the common stock of the Successor Corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.
 
9.1.3
 
. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participants consent; provided, however, a non-substantive
Impact on Performance Goals
 
-15-
 
 
modification to such performance goals only to reflect the Successor Corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.

.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award. Any such deferral elections shall be subject to such rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and, unless expressly determined by the Committee, shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Deferrals
 
10.2
 
.  Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participants employment or service at any time, with or without cause. For purposes of the Plan, transfer of employment of a Participant between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Service. Employment with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-will basis only except as may be provided by contract or applicable law.
No Effect on Employment or Service
 
10.3
 
.  No Employee or Director shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.
Participation
 
10.4
 
.  All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company.
Successors
 
10.5
 
.  No Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to an Award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that a Participant may, in a manner specified by the Committee, (a) transfer an Award to a Participants spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-approved domestic relations order which relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights, and (b) transfer an Award by bona fide gift and not for any consideration, to (i) a member or members of the Participants immediate family, (ii) a trust established for the exclusive benefit of the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participants immediate family, (iii) a partnership, limited liability company or other entity whose only partners or members are the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participants immediate family, or (iv) a foundation in which the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participants immediate family control the management of the foundations assets; provided, however, that the Participant may not transfer an Award if the transfer would, in the sole determination of the Committee, cause the Award to lose eligibility for registration under Form S-8 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The transferability provisions provided in the preceding sentence shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee, and any transfer shall be made in accordance with such procedures as the Committee may specify from time to time.
Limited Transferability of Awards
 
-16-
 
 
10.6
 
.  Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Section 10.5, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that a Participant may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the Participants death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the Participants death shall be paid to the Participants estate and, subject to the terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement, any unexercised vested Award may be exercised by the administrator or executor of the Participants estate. The provisions of this Section 10.6 shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee.
Beneficiary Designations
 
10.7
 
.  Except to the limited extent provided in Sections 6.6 and 6.7, no Participant or beneficiary shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award, unless and until such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agent or registrar, and delivered to the Participant, or beneficiary, or its nominee.
No Rights as Stockholder
 
10.8
 
. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award that is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.  A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved, unless otherwise permitted under Section 162(m).  In determining the amounts earned by a Participant pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period.
Additional Limitations
 
 
 
11.1
 
.  The Plan shall remain effective until no further Shares are available for distribution pursuant to Awards. However, without further stockholder approval, no Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after February 9, 2022.
Duration of the Plan
 
11.2
 
.  Notwithstanding Section 11.1, the Board, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. The amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of a Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted to

Withholding Requirements
 
12.2
 
.  The Committee, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy Tax Obligations, in whole or in part by (a) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, (b) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld or remitted, or (c) such other method(s) determined by the Committee and permitted by Applicable Laws.  The amount of the Tax Obligations shall be deemed to include any amount which the Committee agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant or the Company, as applicable, with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax or social insurance liability to be withheld or remitted is to be determined.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall be determined as of the date that the Tax Obligations are required to be withheld.
Withholding Arrangements
 
 
 
13.1
 
.  Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

The granting of Awards and the issuance and delivery of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all Applicable Laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required and to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance and/or approvals, and Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise or vesting of an Award unless the exercise or vesting of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws, rules, regulations and approvals.
Requirements of Law
 
13.4
 
.  Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Committee, the Committee shall comply with Section 409A in establishing the rules and procedures applicable to deferrals in accordance with Section 10.1 and in taking or permitting such other actions under the
Section 409A

(b)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, LSI will withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay Tax Obligations determined by LSI to be applicable in connection with such vesting.

LSI may require or otherwise allow you to make alternate arrangements to satisfy such Tax Obligations.
 
 
(c)  LSI will not withhold or issue any fractional shares.  LSI will not deliver shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to LSI have been made for the satisfaction of Tax Obligations.
 
 
(d)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of shares.  All Tax Obligations related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares delivered upon vesting are your sole responsibility. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to the withholding of shares and to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 7.
 
 
8. .
Committee Discretion
 
 
(a)  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of some or all of the Restricted Stock Units at any time. If so accelerated, those Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.  Subject to this paragraph 8, if the Committee accelerates the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will be made no later than 60 days following the accelerated vesting date. However, if the Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then, to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, the payment of the accelerated portion of those Restricted Stock Units will be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in paragraph 3 (whether or not you have incurred a Termination of Service on or before such date(s)), including any necessary delay under paragraph 8(b).
 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with your Termination of Service (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by LSI), other than due to death and if (x) you are a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such Termination of Service and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to you on or within the six (6) month period following your Termination of Service, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until at least six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of your Termination of Service, unless you die following your Termination of Service, in which case the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares to your estate or beneficiary as soon as practicable following your death.  Each payment or benefit under the Plan or this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.  It is the intent of this Agreement to be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units or shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply.

13. .

On the grant date shown above, LSI Corporation granted you the number of restricted stock units shown above under the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  If and when it vests, each restricted stock unit entitles you to receive one share of LSI common stock.

By your signature below, you agree that this award is governed by this Notice of Grant, the attached Restricted Stock Unit Agreement and the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. You acknowledge that you have received, read and understand this Notice of Grant, the attached agreement and the plan.

On the grant date (the Grant Date) shown on the attached Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the Notice of Grant), LSI Corporation (LSI or the Company) granted you the number of Restricted Stock Units under the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan), indicated on the Notice of Grant. The Notice of Grant and this agreement collectively are referred to as the Agreement. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this agreement or the Notice of Grant have the same meaning as in the Plan.
 
 
1. . LSI has granted to you the number of restricted stock units indicated in the Notice of Grant.  We refer to the restricted stock units subject to this award as the Restricted Stock Units.
Grant
 
 
2. . Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest, you will have no right to payment of them. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, those Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation of LSI.
LSIs Obligation to Pay
 
 
3. . The Restricted Stock Units are scheduled to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on any date actually will vest only if you have not incurred a Termination of Service prior to that date and any performance goals required to be met have been met. Unless the Board determines otherwise, which determination shall be in a manner that is exempt from or compliant with, Section 409A, vesting will continue during any LSI-approved leave of absence.
Vesting Schedule
 
 
4. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to you in whole Shares, subject to you satisfying any applicable tax withholding obligations. Subject to paragraph 8(b), any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid in shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case no later than 60 days following the vesting date.  In no event will you be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of the payment of any Shares payable under this Agreement.

7. .
Withholding of Taxes
 
 
(a)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, you will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if you are a U.S. taxpayer. If you are a non-U.S. taxpayer, you will be subject to applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)  As of the Grant Date, LSI is not required to withhold, and does not withhold, any shares when restricted stock units held by members of the Board who are U.S. residents vest and you will be responsible for the full amount of Tax Obligations applicable to your Restricted Stock Units. However, if LSI determines to withhold when Restricted Stock Units vest, then whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, LSI will withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay Tax Obligations determined by LSI to be applicable in connection with such vesting. If LSI determines Tax Obligations are applicable in connection with your Restricted Stock Units at any other time, LSI may, in its sole discretion, collect from you an amount equal to such Tax Obligations in any of the following ways: (i) by withholding a portion of the proceeds from your sale of the shares issued to you upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, (ii) by withholding, or having any Affiliate that employs you withhold, such amount from salary or other amounts payable to you, or (iii) requiring you to pay such amount to LSI.  LSI may require or otherwise allow you to make alternate arrangements to satisfy such Tax Obligations.

(d)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI (or any employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of shares.  All Tax Obligations related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares delivered upon vesting are your sole responsibility. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to the withholding of shares and to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 7.
 
 
8. .
Committee Discretion
 
 
(a)  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of some or all of the Restricted Stock Units at any time. If so accelerated, those Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.  Subject to this paragraph 8, if the Committee accelerates the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will be made no later than 60 days following the accelerated vesting date. However, if the Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then, to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, the payment of the accelerated portion of those Restricted Stock Units will be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in paragraph 3 (whether or not you have incurred a Termination of Service on or before such date(s)), including any necessary delay under paragraph 8(b).
 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with your Termination of Service (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by LSI), other than due to death and if (x) you are a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such Termination of Service and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to you on or within the six (6) month period following your Termination of Service, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until at least six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of your Termination of Service, unless you die following your Termination of Service, in which case the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares to your estate or beneficiary as soon as practicable following your death.  Each payment or benefit under the Plan or this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

,

9. . You will not have any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares deliverable hereunder until those shares have been delivered to you or deposited in your account at LSIs designated broker. After you receive the shares, you will have all the rights of a stockholder of LSI with respect to voting those shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on those shares.
Rights as Stockholder
 
 
10. .
No Effect on Employment or Future Awards

(b) LSI does not intend by granting this Award to you to confer upon you the right to be selected to receive any future Award under the Plan.
 
 
11. . Any notice to be given to LSI under this Agreement must be in writing and addressed to LSI Corporation, Attn: Stock Administration Department, Mailstop D-206, 1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035, or such other address as LSI may designate in writing.

If you attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock Units, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, the Restricted Stock Units immediately will be cancelled.
Award is Not Transferable
 
 
13. . The shares you receive as payment for vested Restricted Stock Units are expected to be free of any restriction under the Plan. However, your subsequent sale of the shares may be subject to Rule 144 under the 1934 Act, and will be subject to any market blackout-period that may be imposed by LSI and must comply with LSIs Stock Trading Policy and any applicable securities laws.
Restrictions on Sale of Securities
 
 
14. .

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 25, 2012, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended July 1, 2012. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 24, 2012, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures

9.1.1
 
In the event that the Successor Corporation does not assume or substitute for a Participants Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are part of the Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that are part of the Award will lapse, and, if the Award has performance-based vesting, all Performance Goals or other performance-based vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions will be deemed met.  In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Committee will notify the Participant in writing or electronically (which notice may be in the form of a notice on the Companys Intranet or notice to any e-mail or postal address maintained by the Companys Stock Administration Department for the Participant) that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

(c)           in the case of (i) an Option, (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right, or (iii) a Restricted Stock Unit, the common stock of the Successor Corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.
 
9.1.3
 
. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participants consent; provided, however, a non-substantive modification to such performance goals only to reflect the Successor Corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.

The transferability provisions provided in the preceding sentence shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee, and any transfer shall be made in accordance with such procedures as the Committee may specify from time to time.
 
10.6
 
.  Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Section 10.5, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that a Participant may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the Participants death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the Participants death shall be paid to the Participants estate and, subject to the terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement, any unexercised vested Award may be exercised by the administrator or executor of the Participants estate. The provisions of this Section 10.6 shall be effective only if expressly determined by the Committee.

A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved, unless otherwise permitted under Section 162(m).  In determining the amounts earned by a Participant pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period.

On the grant date shown above, LSI Corporation granted you the number of restricted stock units shown above under the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  If and when it vests, each restricted stock unit entitles you to receive one share of LSI common stock.  We typically will withhold some of the shares you would receive when the restricted stock units vest to satisfy applicable tax or similar withholding obligations.
 
 
Your award will vest according to the vesting schedule shown below. Vesting will occur only if [any applicable performance requirements indicated below have been met and] you have not incurred a Termination of Service prior to the vesting date.
 
 
 
By your signature below, you agree that this award is governed by this Notice of Grant, the attached Restricted Stock Unit Agreement and the LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.

1. . LSI has granted to you the number of restricted stock units indicated in the Notice of Grant.  We refer to the restricted stock units subject to this award as the Restricted Stock Units. When the Restricted Stock Units become payable, or vest, they will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings.

2. . Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest, you will have no right to payment of them. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, those Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation of LSI.
LSIs Obligation to Pay

Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on any date actually will vest only if you have not incurred a Termination of Service prior to that date and any performance goals required to be met have been met. Unless the Board determines otherwise, which determination shall be in a manner that is exempt from or compliant with, Section 409A, vesting will continue during any LSI-approved leave of absence.
Vesting Schedule
 
 
4. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to you in whole Shares, subject to you satisfying any applicable tax withholding obligations. Subject to paragraph 8(b), any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid in shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case no later than 60 days following the vesting date.  In no event will you be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of the payment of any Shares payable under this Agreement.
Payment after Vesting
 
 
5. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, any Restricted Stock Units that have not vested at the time of your Termination of Service will be cancelled.

Withholding of Taxes
 
 
(a)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, you will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if you are a U.S. taxpayer. If you are a non-U.S. taxpayer, you will be subject to applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.
 
 
(b)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, LSI will withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay Tax Obligations determined by LSI to be applicable in connection with such vesting. If LSI determines Tax Obligations are applicable in connection
 
 
 
 
with your Restricted Stock Units at any other time, LSI may, in its sole discretion, collect from you an amount equal to such Tax Obligations in any of the following ways: (i) by withholding a portion of the proceeds from your sale of the shares issued to you upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, (ii) by withholding, or having the Affiliate that employs you withhold, such amount from salary or other amounts payable to you, or (iii) requiring you to pay such amount to LSI.  LSI may require or otherwise allow you to make alternate arrangements to satisfy such Tax Obligations.
 
(c)  LSI will not withhold or issue any fractional shares.  LSI will not deliver shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to LSI have been made for the satisfaction of Tax Obligations.
 
 
(d)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of shares.  All Tax Obligations related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares delivered upon vesting are your sole responsibility. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to the withholding of shares and to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 7.
 
 
8. .
Committee Discretion
 
 
(a)  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of some or all of the Restricted Stock Units at any time. If so accelerated, those Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.  Subject to this paragraph 8, if the Committee accelerates the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will be made no later than 60 days following the accelerated vesting date. However, if the Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then, to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, the payment of the accelerated portion of those Restricted Stock Units will be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in paragraph 3 (whether or not you have incurred a Termination of Service on or before such date(s)), including any necessary delay under paragraph 8(b).
 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with your Termination of Service (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by LSI), other than due to death and if (x) you are a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such Termination of Service and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to you on or within the six (6) month period following your Termination of Service, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until at least six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of your Termination of Service, unless you die following your Termination of Service, in which case the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares to your estate or beneficiary as soon as practicable following your death.  Each payment or benefit under the Plan or this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.  It is the intent of this Agreement to be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units or shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply.
