PRESS RELEASE
 
TERADYNE ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
BOSTON  (Business wire) April 15, 2003  Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $334.6 million for the first quarter of 2003, and a net loss on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis of $76.5 million, or $0.41 per share. The pro forma net loss for the first quarter of 2003 was $48.0 million, or $0.26 per share before asset impairments, the impact of accelerated depreciation and workforce reductions. Net orders increased 23% from the previous quarter to $289 million.
 
"Considering the environment in which we are operating, we are pleased to report that we met our guidance for the quarter and we continue to make progress on improving our financial performance," said George Chamillard, Teradyne Chairman and CEO. "Looking forward, the future of the economy, the timeframe for the winding down of the war and the start of the rebuilding process in Iraq, and the future impact of the SARS epidemic are all unknown. Consequently we are targeting shipments in the second quarter to be in the same range as in recent quarters  $310 to $340 million. We expect our losses to be reduced to between 16 and 24 cents on a pro forma operating basis. This EPS range assumes that we will have no tax benefit in the quarter."
 
Conference Call/Webcast
 
Teradyne will be conducting its conference call tomorrow, April 16, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. E.D.T. The call will be webcast at . A replay will be available on the Teradyne website and via phone starting at 12 Noon E.D.T and continuing through April 30, 2003. The replay may be accessed by calling 1-800-642-1687, code 9435656 or by visiting and clicking onto "Investors" for a link to the replay. In our earnings release, conference call and webcast, we may use or discuss pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed (if available) and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the Teradyne website at , by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the GAAP Reconciliation link.

Pro Forma Results
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. Teradyne reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the pro forma measure helps indicate underlying trends in Teradyne's business, and management uses pro forma measures to establish operational goals.
 
Earnings guidance is provided only on a pro forma basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges, such as accelerated depreciation stemming from existing facility consolidation plans, other additional charges excluded from the pro forma measure are dependent on numerous presently unknown factors. These include asset impairments and severances related to product line divestitures that are dependent in certain instances on finding and successfully negotiating a sale with a third party. Additionally, further goodwill or real estate impairment charges are dependent upon future market conditions and valuations that are not presently determinable.
 
Pro forma information is not determined using GAAP and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures or data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
The reconciliation of certain historical pro forma amounts to GAAP amounts is contained in the tables at the end of this release.
 
Safe Harbor Statement
 
Some statements in this release are forward-looking statements made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions established by securities legislation and are based on the assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management at the time such statements are made. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause Teradyne's financial results to differ
materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our revenue and profit and loss expectations, our future business strategies and market opportunities, improvements in our business, backlog and design-ins, demand for our products, the rate of progress in reducing expenses, and the general economic outlook. Among the factors that could cause results to differ from expectations are the following: further downturn in market demand for electronics which has been affected by the economic slowdown that began in 2000; uncertainty and adverse changes in general economies worldwide; the impact of the war in Iraq, geopolitical turmoil and the threat of terrorist attacks; the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the international marketplace; uncertainty regarding the future growth rate of worldwide economies, which has caused many companies to reduce or delay capital investment; technological and market changes; Teradyne's ability to protect its intellectual property; the historically cyclical nature of the markets that Teradyne serves; new product development and delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new orders; decisions by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; the presence of intense competition throughout the world in each of our operating segments from substantial competitors; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures, including facility consolidations, employee reductions, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities; the possibility of intense price competition and the resulting prospect of having to lower our prices and therefore possibly our revenue; the impact of and our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; the class action securities litigation brought against Teradyne; the increase in our debt service obligations and debt to capital ratio resulting from our issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes and $45 million in mortgage financing that we obtained in 2001; the availability of additional financing; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally which include political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, Teradyne's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Teradyne assumes no obligation to update the information in this press release.

PRESS RELEASE
 
BOSTON  (Business Wire)  July 15, 2003  Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $331.5 million for the second quarter of 2003, and a net loss on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis of $52.5 million, or $0.28 per share. The pro forma net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was $35.4 million, or $0.19 per share before asset impairments, workforce reductions, facility closures and the impact of accelerated depreciation. Net orders increased 5% from the previous quarter, to $305 million.
 
"Orders in our Semiconductor Test business strengthened significantly and were at their highest level in 10 quarters," said George Chamillard, Teradyne Chairman and CEO. "That increased order level is being driven by demand for high-end System On a Chip (SOC) applications. Our growth in semiconductor test orders was partially offset by our other businesses, however, where orders were down sequentially. In our cost reduction program, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of returning to profitability."
 
"For the third quarter, we expect sales to be between $310 and $340 million, and that our loss per share will be reduced to between 11 and 19 cents, on a pro forma basis. This EPS range assumes that we will have no tax benefit in the quarter."

Among the factors that could cause results to differ from expectations are the following: recurrent downturn or slower recovery in market demand for electronics (including especially the markets for semiconductor and telecommunications equipment) which has been affected by the economic slowdown that began in 2000; uncertainty and adverse changes in general economies worldwide; the impact of the war in Iraq, geopolitical turmoil and the threat of terrorist attacks; the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the international marketplace; uncertainty regarding the future growth rate of worldwide economies, which has caused many companies to reduce or delay capital investment; technological and market changes; Teradyne's ability to protect its intellectual property; the historically cyclical nature of the markets that Teradyne serves; new product development and delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new orders; decisions by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; the presence of intense competition throughout the world in each of our operating segments from substantial competitors; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures, including facility consolidations, employee reductions, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities; the possibility of intense price competition and the resulting prospect of having to lower our prices and therefore possibly our revenue; the impact of and our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; the class action securities litigation brought against Teradyne; the increase in our debt service obligations and debt to capital ratio resulting from our issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes and $45 million in mortgage financing that we obtained in 2001; the availability of additional financing; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally which include political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, Teradyne's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

PRESS RELEASE
 
 
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)October 14, 2003Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $329 million for the third quarter of 2003, and a net loss on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis of $53.5 million, or $0.28 per share. The pro forma net loss for the third quarter of 2003 was $26.8 million, or $0.14 per share before special charges. Net orders increased 10% from the previous quarter, to $336 million.
 
"On balance, we are encouraged by our results in the quarter," said George Chamillard, Teradyne Chairman and CEO. "Our orders improved, and our new products are gaining momentum. The third quarter marked our eighth successive period of increasing orders and our book-to-bill ratio was greater than one-to-one for the first time in three years. In addition we made progress lowering costs during the quarter, enabling us to continue on the path to profitability.
 
"Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we are projecting sales to be between $335 to $340 million, and break-even results, on a pro forma operating basis."
 
 
Teradyne will be conducting its conference call tomorrow, October 15, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. E.D.T. The call will be webcast at (click on "Investors"). A replay will be available via phone starting at Noon E.D.T. and continuing through October 29, 2003.

In our earnings release, conference call and webcast, we may use or discuss pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

Pro Forma Results
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. Teradyne reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the pro forma measure helps indicate underlying trends in Teradyne's business, and management uses pro forma measures to plan and forecast future periods, and to establish operational goals.
 
Earnings guidance is provided only on a pro forma basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges, such as some amount of severance due to workforce reductions, other additional charges excluded from the pro forma measure are dependent on numerous presently unknown factors. For example, further goodwill or real estate impairment charges are dependent upon future market conditions and valuations that are not presently determinable.
 
Pro forma information is not determined using GAAP and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures or data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
 
TERADYNE PROMOTES EXECUTIVE TO RUN ASIA; HIRES NEW HEAD OF ASSEMBLY TEST DIVISION
 
BOSTON  (BUSINESS WIRE)  January 9, 2004  Teradyne (NYSE:TER) today announced the appointment of John M. Casey as Senior Vice President responsible for all of the company's activities in Asia. Casey has been with the company since 1977. He served in a number of sales positions early in his career and was appointed a Vice President of the company in 1990. After heading Teradyne's broadband test and logic test businesses, he moved to his current position of President of the Assembly Test Division. Replacing Casey as President of Assembly Test is Jeffrey R. Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss joined Teradyne in 1971 and served in a variety of sales, marketing and product management positions, mostly in the assembly test area. He became a Teradyne Vice President in 1990 and he was appointed as the company's Chief Financial Officer in 1997. In 2000, Hotchkiss left Teradyne to become CEO of Empirix, Inc., a spin-off from Teradyne which provides test and monitoring products for telecom and Internet applications.
 
"Over the last several years, Teradyne has dramatically increased our capability in Asia in account management, engineering, material sourcing, manufacturing and service," said Teradyne President Michael Bradley. The region currently represents about half of our sales and is growing faster than any other region. In recognition of the strategic importance of Asia, it is important that we continue to move the "center of gravity" of our operations towards the region. John will be responsible for building our organizational capability and our business across Asia over the next several years.
 
"We are fortunate that Jeff Hotchkiss will be rejoining Teradyne to replace Casey," Bradley continued. "In his 20 year career at Teradyne, Jeff was a key member of the management team that built our Assembly Test business. That Teradyne experience, combined with his experience as CEO of Empirix, makes him an ideal candidate to continue to build on our current momentum in Assembly Test." Both of these changes are effective immediately.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 24, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") adopted resolutions (i) amending the Teradyne, Inc. 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan to provide for an increased annual stock option grant to a non-employee Chairman of the Board, and (ii) increasing the annual cash retainer paid to a non-employee Chairman of the Board. The increases were approved in recognition of the substantial time, effort, and responsibilities that are associated with the Chairman position. Currently, a non-employee director of the Company receives an annual payment of $45,000 and is granted an annual stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the first Monday of February of each year. As a result of these changes, the Company's Chairman, currently George W. Chamillard, will receive an annual payment of $90,000 and will be granted an annual stock option to purchase 30,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the first Monday of February of each year.
(a)
 
On January 24, 2005, the Board approved the Variable Compensation Plan for 2005 (the "VC Plan"). Pursuant to the VC Plan, executive officers and certain eligible senior employees (collectively, the "VC Participants" and individually, the "VC Participant") who are integral to the success of the business may receive a variable compensation payment from the Company as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The amount of variable compensation each VC Participant receives, if any, is based on overall corporate and individual business group performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee and is calculated as a percentage of the VC Participant's base annual salary (the "VC Factor"). The VC Factors for new VC Participants start at 10%. The VC Factors for VC Participants with greater levels of responsibility and experience may be up to 180% and could exceed 180% when reviewed at the Company's annual July salary review.
(b)
 
In evaluating the overall corporate and individual business group performance, the Compensation Committee considers various factors, including, but not limited to the following: (1) the extent to which quantitative and qualitative plans were met for the year, with an emphasis on profitability, return on net assets and market share; (2) the extent to which process improvement results were achieved; (3) the extent to which results verified each individual business group's strategy and improved its strategic position; and (4) the extent to which each individual business group's mid-term plan and strategy was credible and contributed to the Company's ability to adapt to changes in the marketplace or environment.
 
The Company's Board of Directors and/or Compensation Committee reserve the right to adjust, modify or terminate the VC Plan, in full or in part, at any time in their sole discretion.
 
The VC Plan became effective on the date of its approval by the Board of Directors, January 24, 2005. The above description of the VC Plan is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the VC Plan and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the VC Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
(c) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Variable Compensation Plan ("VC Plan") provides a variable compensation payment to the Company's executive officers and certain eligible senior employees each January based on overall corporate and individual business group (Divisional) performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The amount of Variable Compensation each executive officer and senior employee receives is a function of four factors:
 
 
 
 
 
Each executive officer's and employee's "variable compensation factor" is a percentage of his or her base annual salary, starting at 10% for new participants. At greater levels of responsibility and experience, the variable compensation factor may be up to 180% of base annual salary. Variable compensation factors are reviewed each July as part of the Company's annual salary review and in connection with the review, could increase beyond 180%. A newly hired executive officer or employee, who is approved for eligibility under the VC Plan, will be eligible to receive a VC Plan payment for their first year of employment, pro-rated from the date of hire.
 
At year end, the Compensation Committee evaluates the Company's overall performance versus goals and each individual Division's performance versus goals, with emphasis on the vital goals. Given the dynamics of the business, the Company's VC Plan relies heavily on the Compensation Committee's evaluation and assessment of performance. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee determines whether any variable compensation should be paid and, if so, the amount for distribution. The payments under the VC Plan will be made only after approval by the Compensation Committee.
 
The following factors are considered in evaluating both overall corporate and individual Divisional performance: (1) the extent to which quantitative and qualitative plans were met for the year, with an emphasis on profitability, return on net assets and market share; (2) the extent to which process improvement results were achieved; (3) the extent to which yearly results verified each Division's strategy and improved its strategic position; and (4) the extent to which each Division's yearly mid-term plan and strategy was credible and contributed to the Company's ability to adapt to changes in the marketplace or environment.
Administrative rules and procedures for the VC Plan are maintained, monitored and implemented by the Company's Human Resources department.
 
The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to interpret and apply the terms of this VC Plan, including the determination of whether any particular employee will receive a payment, and the amount of any such payment. The Board of Directors and/or the Compensation Committee reserve the right to adjust, modify or terminate the VC Plan, in full or in part, at any time, in their sole discretion. Subject to an amendment to or termination of this VC Plan by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, this VC Plan applies in 2005 and renews annually each year thereafter.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 26, 2005, the Board of Directors of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") approved a plan (the "Plan") to accelerate on such date the vesting of certain outstanding, unvested "out of the money" stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under the Company's various stock option plans. The stock options that were accelerated have exercise prices that are in excess of $13.26, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and range in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. Options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration.
 
By implementing the Plan, the Company expects to reduce the effects of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's new standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," which requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 10, 2005, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Amphenol Corporation ("Amphenol") providing for the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of Teradyne Connections Systems Division ("TCS"), including the capital stock of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., Teradyne Connection Sys. de Mexico SA de CV and Teradyne Ireland Ltd. (collectively the "TCS Business"). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price payable for the TCS Business will be U.S. $390 million in cash, subject to a post-closing net asset value adjustment (the "Transaction"). Closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") is subject to anti-trust approvals and other customary closing conditions, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. As a part of the Transaction, Teradyne has agreed not to engage in a business that competes with the backplane and connection systems business of the TCS Business for a period of six years.
 
The Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase and sale of the Chinese or Malaysian operations constituting a part of the TCS Business may be delayed for up to six months while required governmental permits or authorizations are obtained. During any such delay period, the Chinese or Malaysian operations, as applicable, will be managed by Amphenol, to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the mutual satisfaction of Amphenol and Teradyne. In the case of a delayed purchase of the Chinese operations, the applicable purchase price will be deposited by Amphenol in an escrow account at Closing, while in the case of a delayed purchase of the Malaysian operations, Teradyne would receive the applicable purchase price at the Closing. Upon consummation of a delayed Chinese or Malaysian purchase, a purchase price adjustment shall be made for net income or loss realized during the period subsequent to Closing and prior to the delayed closing.
 
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. On October 10, 2005, Teradyne issued a press release announcing the signing of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with the signing of the Purchase Agreement, the Teradyne Board of Directors authorized Teradyne to enter into an Agreement Regarding Salary Continuation Benefits with Richard E. Schneider, President of Teradyne Connection Systems Division (the "Agreement"), which agreement was entered into on October 10, 2005. Under the terms of the Agreement, Teradyne will, immediately following the consummation of the Transaction (provided that Mr. Schneider is employed by Teradyne through the consummation of the Transaction) pay to Mr. Schneider an incentive payment of $145,025 and a "variable compensation ("VC") payment" based upon the Teradyne 2005 Variable Compensation Plan ("VC Plan") and calculated in the same manner as VC payments made to all TCS employees participating in the VC Plan. For Mr. Schneider, this VC payment totals $240,075 of which approximately $220,000 is the amount Mr. Schneider would likely have received under the VC Plan through November 2005 (the anticipated date of Closing) if VC Plan payments were prorated based on his last day of employment with Teradyne. VC payments made to TCS employee participants, including Mr. Schneider, are being made pursuant to an exception to the VC Plan. Normally, under the VC Plan, VC payments are not prorated and recipients must remain employed by Teradyne for the entire calendar year and up through the date such payments are approved by the Teradyne Board of Directors (ordinarily sought in January) in order to receive payments.
 
In addition, the Agreement provides that if Mr. Schneider is not offered a position comparable to his current position at Teradyne by Amphenol or is required by Amphenol to relocate his principal place of employment beyond a 50 mile radius and his employment is terminated by Teradyne prior to the date of Closing other than for Cause (as defined in the Agreement), Teradyne shall pay Mr. Schneider a monthly amount equal to 1/12
th
of his current Teradyne annual base salary beginning on the date his employment is
terminated and continuing for a period of approximately 24 months thereafter (the "Severance Period"). The Agreement also provides continued medical and dental insurance plan coverage to Mr. Schneider during the Severance Period.
 
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement noted above, once Mr. Schneider accepts an offer of employment with Amphenol, Amphenol assumes any ongoing severance or salary continuation payments under the Agreement with Mr. Schneider if his employment is terminated by Amphenol for other than Cause or if Mr. Schneider terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Agreement), in each case within nine months following the consummation of the Transaction.
 
In consideration of the benefits provided to Mr. Schneider under the Agreement, Mr. Schneider has agreed with Teradyne, among other things, that (a) during the later of a one year period or the Severance Period, he will not directly or indirectly (i) engage in the solicitation or hiring of employees or customers of Teradyne or its subsidiaries or (ii) compete with Teradyne (as further defined in the Agreement); and (b) he will sign a release of any claims he has or may have against Teradyne or Teradyne subsidiaries.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement between Teradyne and Mr. Schneider does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains statements intended as "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements include statements regarding management's expectations as to the completion of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of anticipated future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and our period reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Teradyne does not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
(A) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (a)(i) with respect to any single Loss which is less than $200,000 on an individual basis (or as part of a group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate from a common set of facts);

(C) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLERS HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MAKE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS OR HAVE ANY LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 10.02(a)(i) OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS ARISING OUT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF FIFTY-EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($58,500,000.00) (THE "");

The foregoing sentence shall not limit or diminish any other defense Sellers may otherwise be entitled to raise in response to any request for indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Sellers expressly reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or otherwise discharged any Buyer from, any claims against any Buyer arising from or relating to any Offsite Release Environmental Claim, so long as such claim is not asserted as a defense, counterclaim, cross-claim, or setoff to any request for indemnification hereunder by either the Buyer Indemnified Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns), and (ii) Buyers expressly reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or otherwise discharged, any defenses, counterclaims or cross claims they may have to such claims. Sellers shall retain the right to commence a separate Proceeding asserting claims against any Buyer to recover any Loss arising from or relating to an Offsite Release Environmental Claim.

(b) Buyers, jointly and severally, hereby indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees, agents and consultants (the "") against and agree to hold each of them harmless from any Loss incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of:

(i) any breach of a representation and warranty made by the Buyers pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term (it being agreed and acknowledged by the parties that for purposes of determining the amount of Loss sustained or incurred with respect to the breach of a representation or warranty and whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any such representation or warranty, the representations and warranties of Buyers shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to
 
materiality generally or to whether or not any breach results or may result in a Material Adverse Effect, except that such words shall be given effect as to whether or not matters are properly disclosed on any Schedule hereto);
 
(ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term; or

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
(A) Buyers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Seller Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (b)(i) with respect to any single Loss which is less than $200,000 on an individual basis (or as part of a group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate from a common set of facts);
 
(B) No Buyer shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Seller Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (b)(i) except to the extent that the aggregate amount of Loss incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties (excluding any Loss for which indemnification would not be available as a result of clause (A) above) exceeds $3,000,000, and only to the extent of such excess;

(E) No action may be commenced by any Seller Indemnified Party against any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02(b) unless and until Buyer Parent has first received written notice from Seller Parent of the occurrence of such claim as provided in Section 10.03(a) (citing this Article X and providing reasonable detail with respect to such event) and Buyer Parent has failed to cure or remedy the event or circumstance giving rise to such claim within ten (10) business days.
 
(c) In determining the amount of any Loss for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to assert a claim for indemnification under this
 
Article X, the amount of any such Loss shall be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds and other third party recoveries, if any, actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in respect of such Loss and the amount of any tax benefit actually realized with respect thereto. If an indemnification payment is received by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, and such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, later receives insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries, or actually realizes any tax benefits specifically in respect of the related Loss, such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall promptly pay to Seller Parent or Buyer Parent, as applicable, a sum equal to the lesser of (y) the actual amount of insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries, or the tax benefits actually realized specifically in respect of the related Loss and (z) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by Sellers or Buyers, as applicable, to such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such Loss. Payments made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price.
 
(d) Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize fees and expenses that may arise from or constitute part of a Loss at levels that are customary and reasonable for similar claims in similar contexts.
 
Section 10.03 .
Procedures; No Waiver; Exclusivity
 
(a) The party seeking indemnification under Article X (the "") agrees to give prompt written notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article X, such notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, suit, action or proceeding, the basis for indemnification hereunder and the approximate dollar amount of Loss for which indemnification is sought (if then reasonably qualifiable); provided, however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If such event involves any claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third person (a ""), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party to assume the control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Third Party Claim, including, at its own expense, employment of counsel; , that if the Indemnifying Party shall have exercised its right to assume such control, the Indemnified Party (i) may, in its sole discretion, employ counsel to represent it (in addition to counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, and at the Indemnified Party's sole expense) in any such matter, and in such event counsel selected by the Indemnified Party shall be required to cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party's counsel in such defense, compromise or settlement, and (ii) will, at its own expense, make reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party those employees of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party whose assistance, testimony or presence is reasonably necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and in defending any such Third Party Claim; , , that any such access shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the business of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim,
Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
Third Party Claim
provided, however
provided further
however
 
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in any case where such judgment, compromise or settlement does not impose any obligation or require any admission of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (other than the payment of monies for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder) and includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, stockholders and employees of a general release from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification hereunder or any proposed consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of any such Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party would reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its business in a manner that may not be adequately compensated by the money damages, or that the Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times and upon prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party to take over and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party shall so assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim, all attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, to the extent related to the defense or counterclaim that is inconsistent with one or more of the defenses or counterclaims that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, shall be at the Indemnified Party's expense and shall not be eligible for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of other Loss suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of the Third Party Claim including the attorneys' fees and other expenses otherwise incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim. If the Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, (a) the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b) should the Indemnified Party receive a binding written offer of settlement from the third party claimant to consent to or enter into a judgment, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim that does not impose any obligation or require any admission of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (other than the payment of monies for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder) and includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, stockholders and employees a general release from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party does not consent to or enter into such judgment, compromise or settlement, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that any Loss exceeds the amount that the Indemnified Party would have reasonably incurred had the Indemnified Party consented to or entered into such judgment, compromise or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter as above provided within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Indemnified Party described above, then the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend against any such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
 
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, with respect to no claim for indemnification pursuant to Article X (or as a part of a group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate from a common set of facts) shall the Indemnified Party be eligible for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party for the attorneys' fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel, plus local counsel, to the Indemnified Party.
 
(b) Procedures Relating to Sellers' Indemnification of Environmental Claims.
 
(i) . Buyers will promptly notify Sellers in writing following Buyers' becoming aware of any Environmental Liability or breach of Section 3.17 which Buyers claim is subject to Section 10.02 (""); provided, however, that Buyers shall notify Sellers within seven (7) business days of their receipt of any written notice of an Environmental Claim.
Notice
Environmental Claim
 
(ii) . Sellers have the right (but not the obligation), upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyers and subject to the provisos below, to assume exclusive control of the resolution and remedy of any Environmental Claim, including without limitation (1) investigating the matter, obtaining tests, reports and surveys necessary to define and delineate the extent of any contamination; (2) subject to the provisions set forth in this paragraph below, contacting Governmental Authorities, making reports and submitting plans and documents to such authorities, negotiating with such authorities or other third parties and otherwise dealing with such authorities; (3) preparing work plans for any investigation, assessment, remediation or monitoring; and (4) conducting or directing any such investigation, assessment, remediation or monitoring. Sellers' election to assume control of the resolution and remedy of any Environmental Claim shall not be deemed an admission of fact, law or otherwise by Sellers in any Proceeding other than to enforce the terms of this Section 10.03(b). Upon receipt of Sellers' written notice of this election to assume exclusive control of the resolution and remedy of an Environmental Claim, Buyers agree neither to: (a) enter into negotiations or settlements with any Governmental Authority or third parties; nor (b) at any time, take or offer to any Governmental Authority or third party any position inconsistent with positions taken or offered by Sellers in its sole and absolute discretion; provided that that Buyers shall have the right to (A) receive copies of all correspondence between Sellers and Governmental Authorities relating to Environmental Claims, (B) review any report or proposal prior to its submission to any Governmental Authority or third party and Sellers shall in good faith take into account any concerns or issues raised by Buyers prior to its submissions to the Governmental Authority or third party and (C) advance notice of and the right to participate in any meeting with Governmental Authorities or third parties relating to Environmental Claims and provided further that Sellers shall not, without the prior written approval of Buyers, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement, agreement, consent decree, order, or remediation plan involving an Environmental Claim.
Right to Remedy
 
(iii) . Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith and make available to each other such information as is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 10.03(b). Buyers will provide any and all reasonable assistance reasonably requested by Sellers in securing any permits or approvals (including without
Cooperation
 
limitation by holding in its name any such permit if required to be held by Buyers by applicable Law) reasonably required to perform any investigatory, assessment, remedial or monitoring activities; provided that expenses incurred by Buyers in performing such assistance will be reimbursed by Sellers and any such amounts reimbursed shall be applied towards the Cap. Buyers will provide Sellers with, or cause Sellers to be provided with, reasonable access (without charge) to relevant documents and records and to the Purchased Real Property in order to perform any remediation, investigation, assessment, sampling, monitoring, removal, cleanup or any other action required to fulfill Sellers' obligations under this Agreement. Sellers agree that any access to the Purchased Real Property necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 10.03(b) will only be at hours and for periods agreed to by Buyers in their reasonable discretion and that such access will not materially interfere with Buyers' business activities conducted at such premises. Buyers will reasonably cooperate with the implementation of any investigation, assessment, remedial or monitoring activities, to the extent such activities do not materially interfere with normal business activities conducted by Buyers.
 
(iv) . Sellers will be deemed to have satisfied their obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Environmental Claim related to the Purchased Real Property when (i) the result meets or exceeds the least stringent standards provided by applicable Environmental Laws (including any standards based on the use of deed or land use restrictions, institutional controls and/or resulting from any site-specific risk assessments) subject to Buyers' rights to review and approve such standards, as set forth in the last sentence of this paragraph, based on the use of the property on the Closing Date and applicable Environmental Laws and (ii) with respect to any Environmental Claim initiated by any Governmental Authority, upon receipt of a "no further action" letter, site cleanup rehabilitation order or other written decision from any Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction over such Environmental Claim that no further investigation, assessment, monitoring or remediation is required by the Buyers (or Sellers if Sellers are the performing party). Buyers acknowledge that resolution of any Environmental Claim may require the imposition of deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions and, so long as such restrictions do not materially interfere with the use of the Purchased Real Property as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or impose any material liability or obligation on Buyers, upon review of the proposed deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions, Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to the recording of any such restrictions by Seller. Buyers' right to review and approve, as provided in the foregoing sentence, shall be limited to determining in good faith whether the deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions proposed by Sellers materially interfere with the use of the Purchased Real Property as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or impose any material liability or obligation on Buyers. Buyer shall have the right to review and approve any standards provided under Environmental Laws that are proposed to be applied by Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (iv) to determine in good faith that such standards are consistent with and sufficient to satisfy the related Environmental Claim.
Satisfaction of Obligation
 
(v) . Each party will keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any investigatory, assessment, remediation or monitoring activities with respect to Environmental Claims and will provide the other party with copies of all
Disclosure
 
material monitoring, sampling and other data relating to such matters subject to Buyers' rights as described in the proviso in Section 10.03(b)(ii)(A), (B) and (C). Sellers shall provide Buyers, or cause Buyers to be provided with, true and correct copies (without charge) of all relevant documents and records which Sellers obtain or prepare in order to perform any remediation, investigation, assessment, sampling, monitoring, treatment, removal, cleanup or other action required to fulfill Seller's obligations under this Agreement (including by way of illustration and not limitation any Phase I environmental reports and any Phase II environmental reports). Neither party will notify any Governmental Authority or third party of the existence or substance of facts and circumstances giving rise to an Environmental Claim except as required by Law or with the consent of the other party. If a party believes it is necessary or appropriate, pursuant to a Law, to disclose any such information, that party will first promptly notify the other party of such requirement and the content and timing of any disclosure that it proposes to make unless in the reasonable judgment of the party circumstances and applicable Law require immediate notification.
 
(vi) . As long as Sellers shall have any obligations to Buyers hereunder with respect to Environmental Claims, Buyers will not engage in, permit or cause any subsurface investigations at or adjacent to the Purchased Real Property, including sampling of soil or groundwater, except (1) in the ordinary course in connection with construction activities (including by way of illustration and not limitation obtaining any construction financing for any such construction activities or entering into any construction contracts wherein Phase I or Phase II environmental reports are required with respect to any such construction activities by Buyers) by Buyers at the Purchased Real Property; (2) in connection with the Release of any Hazardous Material when in the Buyer's reasonable judgment such Release requires any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports in order to ensure that such Release does not cause or has not caused an Environmental Claim; (3) in connection with any proposed sale, transfer, leasing, mortgaging or recording of other encumbrances, pledges or hypothecation of any of the Purchased Real Property or change of control, provided that any such proposed action is reasonably believed by Buyer to be probable to occur (collectively, a "") in the event the Buyers receive a written request in connection with any such Transfer by any third party to obtain any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports; (4) in connection with any pending or threatened claims of injury to person (each, a "") by any officer, director, employee, agent or invitee of Buyers or the reasonable belief by Buyers that any such person may have a Personal Injury Claim; (5) as may be recommended in a Phase I environmental report with respect to the Purchased Real Property, upon the written consent of Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; or (6) as required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to Environmental Laws to the extent that such requirement is not attributable to a request or notification by Buyers not required by Environmental Laws.
Investigations
Transfer
Personal Injury Claim
 
(vii) . Buyers' breach of Section 10.03(b)(vi) will relieve Sellers, to the extent of any Loss suffered or incurred by such breach, of its obligation to indemnify Buyers for any Environmental Claim if and to the extent that such breach is materially prejudicial to Seller's ability to remediate such Environmental Claim or otherwise prevents Sellers from discharging their obligations hereunder.
Buyers' Breach
 
(viii) Sellers shall comply with Section 10.02(a)(G) in exercising their rights and discharging their obligations under this Section 10.03(b).
 
(c) After the Closing, this Article X will provide the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for the matters referred to in Section 10.02, other than as provided in Section 12.13.
 
(d) . Prior to commencing any action against the other party under or on account of this Agreement or exercising rights pursuant to Section 10.03(b)(vii), knowledgeable senior executive officers of each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall meet to discuss the dispute. If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) days following submission of such dispute to such officers, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, each party may exercise any and all of its rights pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of a party to seek relief as provided in Section 12.13.

(i) by mutual written agreement of Seller Parent and Buyer Parent;
 
(ii) by the Buyer Parent, if (A) the Sellers shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of their obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall not be true in any material respect, in each case such that Seller Parent could not deliver to Buyer Parent at Closing an accurate certificate as contemplated by Section 9.02(a), and (B) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to the Buyer Parent's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the Buyer Parent gives the Seller Parent written notice identifying in reasonable detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation;
 
(iii) by the Seller Parent, if (A) the Buyers shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of their obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Buyers set forth in this Agreement shall not be true in any material respect, in each case such that Buyer Parent could not deliver to Seller Parent at Closing an accurate certificate as contemplated by Section 9.03(a), and (B) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to the Seller Parent's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the Seller Parent gives the Buyer Parent written notice identifying in reasonable detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation;
 
(iv) by either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to any nonappealable final order, decree or
 
judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction, and such order, decree or judgment would either have or be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or would restrain or prohibit the material transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;
 
(v) by either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent if the Closing does not occur on or prior to April 30, 2006; provided that such termination right shall not be available to a party that has failed to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or whose acts or omissions have been a significant cause of the Closing not occurring on or before such date.
 
(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 11.01(a) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party.

If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 11.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided, however, that if such termination shall result from the willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party or to perform a covenant of this Agreement or from a willful breach by either party to this Agreement, a claim for indemnification may be brought against the non-performing or breaching party pursuant to and in accordance with Article X, provided that a claim for indemnification shall not be the exclusive remedy in such case. If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (i) Section 6.07(a) relating to certain expenses, (ii) Articles I, X and XII, (iii) Section 11.01 and this Section 11.02 and (iv) Section 6.05 relating to publicity, which shall survive such termination.

Exhibit 99.1
 
TERADYNE TO SELL CONNECTION SYSTEMS AND FOCUS ON TEST
 
BOSTON, MA, October 10, 2005  Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) announced today that it has reached an agreement to sell its Connection Systems division to Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) for $390 million in cash (subject to a post-closing net asset value adjustment). Connection Systems, based in Nashua, NH, is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density connectors, as well as high-performance printed circuit boards and backplane interconnect systems. In 2004, the division accounted for 23% of Teradyne's revenue.
 
"The sale of Connection Systems will sharpen our focus on our core test businesses," said Michael Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "That concentration will strengthen our ability to do what we do best  provide our test customers with better products and services that meet their evolving needs. This strategic move also increases our financial flexibility to support our growth plans in our core test businesses.
 
"While Connection Systems has been part of Teradyne for more than 30 years, the long term strategic direction of that business and the rest of Teradyne has been diverging. Connection Systems is a better fit with Amphenol, and we wish the new, combined team continued success in the future."
 
More details on this transaction will be supplied during the company's earnings conference call on Wednesday, October 19 at 10 a.m. EDT. The sale is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

Safe Harbor Statement
 
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of
the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; new product development introductions and transitions and any delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings (including the timing, price and mix of new product acceptance); competitive pressures (including new products, pricing and gross margin pressures); the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, employee reductions, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities); insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; incoming quality of components or raw materials; the impact of our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; any material litigation against Teradyne; the increase in our debt service obligations and debt to capital ratio resulting from our issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes in 2001; the availability of additional financing; our obligations in the event of a change of control; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Teradyne Announces Third Quarter Results
 
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)Oct. 18, 2005Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $386.7 million in the third quarter, up 21% compared to the second quarter, and an 11% sequential increase in orders to $387.9 million. The company had a net loss in the third quarter of $35.4 million or $0.18 per share. This loss included $52.8 million or $0.27 per share in charges, consisting of an inventory provision of $38.5 million in Semiconductor Test related to non-FLEX products, and net restructuring and other charges of $14.3 million. The net restructuring and other charges reflect progress towards the company's previously communicated plan of lowering its breakeven level. Excluding these charges, the company had pro forma net income per share of $0.09 in the third quarter. In the previous quarter, the company had a net loss of $45.5 million or $0.23 per share, which included $10.2 million or $0.05 per share in net restructuring and other charges.
 
"While total orders were up 11%, our semiconductor test orders grew 40% over the second quarter," said Michael Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "That increase was driven by an expansion of our FLEX System-On-a-Chip (SOC) family of testers across a broad range of device applications. FLEX also set another bookings record in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're projecting strong growth in our continuing operations of semiconductor test, assembly test, and broadband test. Our recent decision to divest our Connection Systems business will enable us to focus on and grow our core test businesses and stay more tightly connected to our customers."
 
On October 10, 2005, Teradyne announced it had signed an agreement, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, to sell its Connection Systems division for $390 million in cash (subject to a post-closing net asset value adjustment). Provided that occurs, Connection Systems' fourth quarter financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Therefore, Connection Systems' revenue and expenses for the fourth quarter will not be included in the company's continuing operations.
 
The company's continuing operations guidance for the fourth quarter is for sales to be between $330 and $350 million, with net income per share from continuing operations of between $0.42 and $0.45. This includes $0.26 per share of income consisting of: a one-time tax benefit of $0.23 per share and a gain from the anticipated sale of a building of $0.05 per share; offset to a lesser extent by net restructuring and other charges of $0.02 per share. Excluding these items, the fourth quarter guidance for pro forma net income per share from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.16 and $0.21.
 
The tax benefit referred to above of $0.23 per share is a direct result of the anticipated gain on the sale of Connection Systems and a corresponding tax provision is included in discontinued operations in conformity with GAAP. Net income for the quarter, including results of continuing operations, discontinued operations, and gain on disposal of discontinued operations is expected to be between $0.96 and $1.01 per share.
 
To facilitate a better understanding of the fourth quarter guidance which excludes Connection Systems operations, there are four exhibits attached that disclose and reconcile GAAP to pro forma results for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2005 and give effect to the divestiture of Connection Systems as of the beginning of 2005.

Pro Forma Results and Guidance
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. In addition, Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that give effect to the divestiture of Connection Systems as of January 1, 2005. Management believes these pro forma measures helps indicate underlying trends in Teradyne's business and in the immediate instance, illustrate the anticipated financial effect of the sale of the Connection Systems business and help facilitate a better understanding of the fourth quarter guidance, which excludes Connection Systems operations. Management also uses pro forma measures to plan and forecast future periods, and to establish operational goals. Accordingly, fourth quarter earnings guidance is disclosed on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain charges and anticipates the closing of the Connection Systems divestiture in the fourth quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma financial information discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the company's website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Pro Forma Reconciliation" link.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: risks associated with the sale of Connection Systems (including our inability to successfully consummate the sale, operating difficulties resulting from such failure, which may lead to negative impact on the results of operations of Connection Systems and the company generally, and the material diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations as a result of the sale process); adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter;
the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; new product development introductions and transitions and any delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings (including the timing, price and mix of new product acceptance); competitive pressures (including new products, pricing and gross margin pressures); the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, employee reductions, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities); insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; incoming quality of components or raw materials; the impact of our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; any material litigation against Teradyne; the increase in our debt service obligations and debt to capital ratio resulting from our $371.5 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior convertible notes; the availability of additional financing; our obligations in the event of a change of control; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets), and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and

GAAP to Pro Forma Earnings Guidance Reconciliation
 
Earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2005 is being provided on a GAAP and pro forma basis. Pro forma information is not determined using GAAP and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures or data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
(1) Under GAAP, when calculating diluted earnings per share, convertible debentures must be assumed to have converted if the effect on EPS would be dilutive. For Teradyne, dilution occurs when earnings are greater than $0.24 per share per quarter. Accordingly, for GAAP net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, diluted shares assume the conversion of the convertible debentures as the effect would be dilutive. Diluted shares for the Pro Forma net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 does not assume the conversion of the convertible debentures, as the effect of the conversion on EPS would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, 14.3 million shares have been included in diluted shares and net interest expense of $3.4 million has been added back to net income for the diluted earnings per share calculation.
 
(2) Restructuring and Other Charges, net consists of:
 
 
(3) Under GAAP, there will be a tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards used as a result of the sale of TCS. There will be an offsetting tax provision included in the gain on sale of TCS included in discontinued operations.
GAAP to Pro Forma Statement of Operations Reconciliation
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. Teradyne reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the pro forma measure helps indicate underlying trends in Teradyne's business, and management uses pro forma measures to plan and forecast future periods and to establish operational goals.
 
Pro forma information is not determined using GAAP and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures or data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
GAAP to Pro Forma ReconciliationConnection Systems Divestiture
 
The accompanying GAAP and pro forma statements of operations for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2005 reflect the disposition of Connection Systems ("TCS") as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2005. The pro forma adjustments are based on the operations of TCS during the periods presented, the impact from the sale of the TCS business and other transactions associated with the disposition. They have been made to illustrate the anticipated financial effect of the sale of the TCS business and are based on presently available information. Consequently, the pro forma financial information presented is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been reported had the transaction actually occurred as of January 1, 2005.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On November 30, 2005, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") completed the sale to Amphenol Corporation ("Amphenol") of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of Teradyne Connections Systems Division ("TCS"), including the capital stock of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., Teradyne Connection Sys. de Mexico SA de CV and Teradyne Ireland Ltd., for U.S. $390 million in cash, subject to a post-closing net asset value adjustment (the "Transaction"). The Transaction was completed pursuant to an asset and stock purchase agreement, dated as of October 10, 2005, between Teradyne and Amphenol (the "Purchase Agreement"), as amended. A copy of the Purchase Agreement was previously filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2005.
 
Effective upon the consummation of the disposition, Richard E. Schneider, former President of TCS, ceased to be an executive officer or employee of Teradyne.
 
On December 1, 2005, Teradyne issued a press release announcing the closing of the Transaction. This press release is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The pro forma adjustments are based on the operations of TCS during the periods presented, the impact from the sale of the TCS business and other transactions associated with the disposition.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teradyne Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results
 
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)Jan. 17, 2006Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $345.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 18% over the third quarter of 2005. Net income in the fourth quarter was $224.1 million, or $1.07 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations was $89.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, and $50.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the fourth quarter were $377.6 million, up 26% over the third quarter.
 
For fiscal 2005, sales were $1.08 billion. Net income for the year was $90.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. The company had a net loss from continuing operations of $60.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, and a net loss of $33.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.
 
"The fourth quarter capped a year of significant improvement for Teradyne," said Michael Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Throughout 2005, we had solid sequential growth in sales and bookings, strong fourth quarter profit performance in both our Semiconductor Test and non-Semiconductor Test businesses, and a much-improved balance sheet. Our FLEX (TM) System-On-a-Chip (SOC) tester led the way throughout the year.
 
"As we enter 2006, we have excellent product momentum across all our businesses, we have delivered on our 2005 breakeven reduction goals and we're designed into end products that have great potential."
 
Sales in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be between $340 million and $360 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.18 and $0.22, including $6.8 million, or $0.03 per share of stock-based compensation.
 
On November 30, 2005, Teradyne completed the sale of its Connection Systems division to Amphenol Corporation for $385 million in cash as adjusted post-closing and further subject to post-closing net asset value adjustments. Connection Systems' revenue and expenses are reported on a net basis in discontinued operations, and therefore have been excluded from continuing operations in all reported periods.
 
Non-GAAP Results
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by Management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company
believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. A reconciliation of each GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Company's website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; new product development introductions and transitions and any delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings (including the timing, price and mix of new product acceptance); competitive pressures (including new products, pricing and gross margin pressures); the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, employee reductions, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities); insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; incoming quality of components or raw materials; the impact of our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; any material litigation against Teradyne; our obligations in the event of a change of control; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets), and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
 
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other charges, net, certain inventory provisions and the effect of one-time tax items. GAAP requires that these costs and charges be included in costs and expenses and accordingly is used to determine income from continuing operations and earnings per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

2006 Variable Compensation Plan
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Variable Compensation Plan for 2006 (the "2006 VC Plan"). Pursuant to the 2006 VC Plan, executive officers and certain eligible senior employees (each, a "VC Participant") who are integral to the success of the business may receive a variable compensation payment from the Company as determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board (or the full Board in the case of the CEO). The amount of variable compensation, if any, payable to each VC Participant (other than VC Participants in the corporate division, the CEO, CFO and certain other executives) is based on business unit performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee and to the CEO, CFO and certain other executive officers is based on a weighted aggregation of the business unit performances, and, in each case, is calculated as a percentage of the VC Participant's base annual salary (the "VC Factor"). The VC Factors for new VC Participants start at 10% and with greater levels of responsibility may be as high as 200%.
 
In evaluating individual business group performance, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider various factors, including, profitability, return on net assets, market share, strategic position, overall business strategy and quantitative vital goals.
 
The Board and/or Compensation Committee may at any time, in their sole discretion, further adjust, modify or terminate the 2006 VC Plan, in full or in part.
 
The 2006 VC Plan became effective on January 26, 2006, the date of its approval by the Board. The above description of the 2006 VC Plan is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the 2006 VC Plan and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the 2006 VC Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreements
 
In connection with the first grant of restricted stock units to executive officers and directors, the Board approved on January 26, 2006, the agreement forms for restricted stock unit grants for executive officers, including the CEO (the "Executive Grant Agreement") and for the directors (the "Director Grant Agreement" and, together with the Executive Grant, the "Grant Agreements"). Awards under the Grant Agreements will be made pursuant to the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan").
 
Under the terms of the Grant Agreements, awards to directors will vest after a one year period, with 100% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date. Awards to executive officers, including the CEO, will vest over two years, with 50% of the award subject to time-based vesting and 50% of the award subject to performance-based vesting. The performance criteria (which will be consistent with the performance criteria used for the 2006 VC Plan) for performance-based grants will be assessed on the first anniversary of the grant date and, in turn, determine the number of performance-based restricted stock units available for vesting over the two-year vesting period; portions of the performance-based grants not available for vesting will be forfeited.
Individuals receiving restricted stock unit awards will not have any right in, to or with respect to any shares covered by the award until the award is settled by issuance of shares to the individuals.
 
The above description of the Grant Agreements is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the Grant Agreements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the forms of the Executive Grant Agreement and the Director Grant Agreement filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K.
 
Executive Compensation
 
On January 25, 2006, the Compensation Committee took the following actions regarding executive compensation:
 
 
 
 
Non-Employee Director Compensation
 
On January 26, 2006, the non-employee directors, including the Chairman of the Board, waived the annual automatic stock option grants that they would have received on February 6, 2006 under the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (options for the purchase of 15,000 and 30,000 shares of Teradyne's common stock for the directors and the Chairman, respectively) in exchange for the restricted stock units described below.
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the grant of restricted stock units that will vest over a one year period to all non-employee directors and the Chairman of the Board. Grants to directors will have a value of $90,000 and the grant to the Chairman will
have a value of $180,000, in each case, based on the fair market value of Teradyne's common stock on the grant date. These grants of restricted stock units will be made on February 6, 2006 under the 1997 Plan. In connection with the approval by the Board of the restricted stock unit awards, the Board also approved the terms of the Director Grant Agreement, the form of which is set forth in Exhibit 10.2 and is described above.
 
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board approved resolutions that authorize management to repurchase up to an aggregate of $300 million of the of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2006 (the "Notes"), which sum represents the remaining outstanding amount of the Notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and/or auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board approved a new policy regarding director election in the form of an amendment to the Teradyne, Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines"). This modification to the Guidelines was implemented as a part of the Company's continuing efforts to enhance corporate governance procedures. Under the modified Guidelines, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Governance Committee or another committee of the Board (the "Committee") will consider the resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept it. The board will act on the Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Thereafter, the Board will promptly disclose their decision relative to the tendered resignation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. The amended Guidelines became effective immediately upon its adoption by the Board. A copy of the Guidelines, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Variable Compensation Plan ("VC Plan") provides a variable compensation payment to the Company's executive officers and certain eligible senior employees each January based on individual business group (Divisional) performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee) or the Board of Directors. The amount of Variable Compensation each executive officer and senior employee receives is a function of three factors:
 
 
 
 
Each executive officer's and employee's "variable compensation factor" is a percentage of his or her base annual salary, starting at 10% for new participants. At greater levels of responsibility and experience, the variable compensation factor may increase to or exceed 180% of base annual salary. Variable compensation factors are reviewed each year. A newly hired executive officer or employee, who is approved for eligibility under the VC Plan, will be eligible to receive a VC Plan payment for their first year of employment, pro-rated from the date of hire.
 
At year end, the Compensation Committee evaluates each individual Division's performance versus goals, with emphasis on the vital goals. Given the dynamics of the business, the Company's VC Plan relies heavily on the Compensation Committee's or Board of Director's evaluation and assessment of performance. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee determines whether any variable compensation should be paid and, if so, the amount for distribution, except that the full Board of Directors determines whether any variable compensation should be paid to the CEO and, if so, the amount. The payments under the VC Plan will be made only after approval by the Compensation Committee and/or Board of Directors.
 
The following factors are considered in evaluating individual Divisional performance: (1) the extent to which quantitative and qualitative plans were met for the
year, with an emphasis on profitability, return on net assets and market share; (2) the extent to which process improvement results were achieved; (3) the extent to which yearly results verified each Division's strategy and improved its strategic position; and (4) the extent to which each Division's yearly mid-term plan and strategy was credible and contributed to the Company's ability to adapt to changes in the marketplace or environment.
 
Administrative rules and procedures for the VC Plan are maintained, monitored and implemented by the Company's Human Resources department.
 
The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to interpret and apply the terms of this VC Plan, including the determination of whether any particular employee will receive a payment, and the amount of any such payment. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reserve the right to adjust, modify or terminate the VC Plan, in full or in part, at any time, in its sole discretion. Subject to an amendment to or termination of this VC Plan by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, this VC Plan shall commence in 2006 and renew annually each year thereafter.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of (the "Company") has adopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to assist the Board in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities and to serve the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Guidelines should be applied in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and stock exchange rules and the Company's charter and bylaws, each as amended and in effect from time to time. The Guidelines provide a framework for the conduct of the Board's business. The Board may modify or make exceptions to the Guidelines from time to time in its discretion and consistent with its duties and responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders.

Exhibit 99.1
Teradyne Announces First Quarter 2006 Results
BOSTON  (BUSINESS WIRE)  April 18, 2006  Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $363 million for the first quarter of 2006. Net income in the quarter was $44.9 million, or $0.23 per share on a GAAP basis, and $50.8 million, or $0.25 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the first quarter were $364 million, with semiconductor test orders up 10% sequentially.
"We're off to a strong start in 2006," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Our semiconductor test business posted its sixth straight quarter of increased bookings, driven by another record order level for our FLEX System-On-a-Chip (SOC) test systems."
Sales in the second quarter of 2006 are expected to be between $360 million and $380 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.31 and $0.35, including $18 million, or $0.08 of net gains on the sale of real estate.
Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and by providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. A reconciliation of each GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; incoming quality of components or raw materials; insufficient or excess inventory; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing, information technology and engineering activities); the risks of potential environmental liability; any material litigation against Teradyne; the ability to attract and retain key employees; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other charges, net, certain inventory provisions and the effect of one-time tax items. GAAP requires that these costs and charges be included in determining Net Income/(Loss) and Net Income/(Loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP
 
(4) To adjust the profit sharing calculation in accordance with the profit sharing plan.
(5) To adjust the tax provision for the non-GAAP items.
(6) Under GAAP, when calculating diluted earnings per share, convertible debentures must be assumed to have converted if the effect on EPS would be dilutive. For Teradyne, dilution occurs when earnings are greater than $0.24 per share per quarter. Accordingly, for net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, diluted shares assume the conversion of the convertible debentures as the effect would be dilutive. Accordingly, 13.7 million shares have been included in diluted shares and net interest expense of $3.3 million has been added back to net income for the diluted earnings per share calculation. Diluted shares for GAAP net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended April 2, 2006 and both GAAP and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended April 3, 2005 do not assume the conversion of the convertible debentures, as the effect of the conversion on EPS would be anti-dilutive. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended April 2, 2006 assumes the conversion of the convertible debentures as the effect would be dilutive. Accordingly, 11.2 million shares have been included in the diluted shares and net interest expense of $2.7 million has been added back to net income for the non-GAAP dilutive earnings per share calculation.

Teradyne, Inc. 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") held on May 25, 2006 (the "2006 Annual Meeting"), the Company's shareholders approved the Teradyne, Inc. 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan as approved on May 25, 2006 will expire on May 24, 2016. The Plan replaces the Teradyne, Inc. 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, which expires in 2006; the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, which will expire in 2007; and the Teradyne, Inc. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan which will expire in 2011 (collectively, the "Terminated Plans"). Beginning in 2007, the Plan will also replace the Variable Compensation Plan, the Company's cash compensation plan.
The purpose of the Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in the Company. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or another committee designated by the Board of Directors (collectively with the Compensation Committee, the "Committee"), administers the Plan. All employees, officers, consultants and advisors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and the Company's directors are eligible to participate in the Plan.
Types of Awards
The Plan authorizes the grant of cash and stock-based awards. Stock-based awards may take the form of (1) non-qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. Awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Committee. Participants in the Plan may satisfy the purchase or exercise price of stock-based awards in cash, common stock, a combination of cash and common stock, as the Committee may determine.
Generally.
Each non-employee director will receive automatic cash or stock-based awards having a fair market value equal to (1) 300% of his or her annual cash retainer (excluding separate committee chair retainers) on the date first elected to the Board and (2) 180% of his or her annual cash retainer (excluding separate committee chair retainers) on the first Monday in February in each year such director continues to be a non-employee director of the Company.
Non-Employee Director Formula Grants.
Cash awards can be granted alone, in addition to, or in tandem with stock-based awards. These awards may be based on a predetermined "variable compensation factor," that is reviewed annually, and on performance criteria as determined by the Committee. The variable compensation factor is a percentage of the Plan participant's base annual salary, starting at 10% for new participants and can increase up to 200% or beyond at the Committee's discretion. The Committee may not authorize a variable compensation payout based on performance criteria in excess of 200%.
Cash Awards.
Available Shares
The aggregate number of shares available under the Plan is 12,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Shares of common stock that were available for grant under the Terminated Plans as of May 25, 2006, are no longer available for grant under the Plan. The aggregate number of shares will not be reduced by shares granted by the Company in assumption of, or exchange for, awards granted by another company as a result of a merger or consolidation. The number of shares under the Plan may be adjusted for changes in the Company's capital structure, such as a stock split or merger.
Award Limits
The maximum number of shares of stock-based Awards that may be granted to any one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock.
Other Terms
Other than in limited circumstances, full-value stock-based awards are subject to a minimum vesting period of three years if such awards are time-based or one year if such awards are tied to performance criteria.
Vesting.
Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, awards may be transferred only by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, provided that nonstatutory stock options may be transferred to a grantor retained annuity trust or a similar estate planning vehicle.
Transferability.
In the event of a participant's disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or other change in the employment or other status, the Committee will determine, subject to applicable law, the effect of such event on an award, and the extent to which and the period during which the participant, or the participant's legal representative, may exercise rights under the award. In connection therewith, the Committee is permitted to accelerate in full or in part any award that may be settled in cash, provided that with respect to restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards or other full-value stock-based awards, the Committee is permitted to accelerate such awards only in the event of the participant's disability, death, retirement or upon the acquisition of the Company by another entity.
Effect of Termination, Disability or Death.
The Committee may, without shareholder approval, amend, modify or terminate any outstanding award, except that: (1) the Committee may not materially and adversely change the terms of a participant's award without the participant's consent; (2) previously-issued options may not be amended without shareholder approval to reduce the price at which such previously issued options are exercisable or to extend the period of time beyond ten years for which such previously-issued option shall be exercisable; and (3) previously issued full-value stock-based awards may not be accelerated without shareholder approval other than in the event of death, disability or retirement of a participant or an acquisition of Teradyne.
Amendment of Awards.
It is the Company's intention that the entire amount of "qualified performance-based compensation" issued under the Plan in excess of $1,000,000 will be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In addition, the Plan and every award made pursuant to the Plan will be construed, administered and enforced as necessary to comply with applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury and IRS rulings and regulations so that no participant, without his or her express consent, incurs any additional tax or interest liabilities of Section 409A(a)(B) of the Code with respect to any award. The Plan provides that the provisions of the Plan and every award are modified and limited as necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A.
Section 162(m) and Section 409A.
Treatment upon Acquisition
Unless otherwise provided in the award agreement, in the event the Company is acquired by another entity, appropriate provision will be made for the continuation or the assumption by the surviving or acquiring entity of all awards granted under the Plan. In place of or in addition to the foregoing, the Committee may provide that awards granted under the Plan must be exercised by a certain date or shall be terminated in exchange for a cash payment or for stock and stock-based awards issued by the acquiring entity. The Committee may also authorize the acceleration in full or in part of any then outstanding award.
Termination and Amendment of Plan
Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time on or prior to May 24, 2016, and awards granted before that date may be exercised thereafter. The Committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part, provided that any material amendment to the Plan will not be effective unless approved by the Company's shareholders. Unissued shares covered by stock-based awards that have expired, terminated, surrendered or forfeited shall again be available for the grant of awards under the Plan.
Teradyne, Inc. Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors
At its meeting on May 24-25, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an amendment and restatement of the Teradyne, Inc. Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Director Deferral Plan"). The Director Deferral Plan as amended and restated is intended to conform the terms of the plan originally adopted in 2001 (the "Prior Director Deferral Plan") to the requirements of the recently enacted Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder ("Section 409A") and to enlarge the elections provided under the Plan.
The purpose of the Director Deferral Plan is to permit non-employee directors to defer receipt of the compensation they would otherwise receive as members of the Board of Directors of the Company. Each non-employee director makes independent elections concerning the deferral of his or her compensation.
Under the Prior Director Deferral Plan each non-employee director could elect to defer all of his or her cash compensation from the Company. Any cash deferral was allocated, at the election of the director, either to a notional account, which is credited with interest at the 10-year Treasury Note rate, or allocated to a deferred stock unit account and treated as invested in common stock of the Company. On termination of the director's service with the Company, the entire deferred amount was distributed in cash or Company common stock to the director in a manner consistent with the director's elections.
Under the restated Director Deferral Plan, each non-employee director will have the opportunity to elect to defer all of his or her cash compensation and all of his or her compensation in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The director will continue to have the choice of allocating the deferred cash to a notional account or to deferred stock unit account. Any restricted stock or restricted stock units which a director elects to defer shall also be converted into deferred stock units, which shall continue to be subject to the vesting provisions applicable to such compensation. Any Company common stock issued to directors as part of the distribution of deferred compensation shall be issued from either the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (for deferrals made prior to May 25, 2006) or the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (for deferrals made on or after May 25, 2006), depending on the director compensation to which the deferral relates. In addition, the restated Director Deferral Plan permits non-employee directors to elect to have any deferrals made after 2004 distributed in either installments (over up to 15 years) or in a lump sum after the director leaves the Board.
The restated Director Deferral Plan is unfunded and paid solely from the Company's general assets.
Please refer to the amended and restated Director Deferral Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, for the complete terms of the Plan.
Teradyne, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
At its meeting on May 24-25, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Section 409A compliant version of the Teradyne, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") for benefits accrued and vested under the SERP after December 31, 2004. This SERP provides supplemental retirement benefits to employees, including executive officers, who are eligible for participation.
The purpose of the SERP is to provide the eligible executives with additional retirement benefits, taking into account the limitations imposed on the retirement benefits received by such employees under the Retirement Plan for Employees of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Retirement Plan") due to restrictions imposed by the Code.
Employees accruing benefits under the SERP include those who were active members of the SERP on December 31, 2004 and those who become members thereafter. An employee who elected to continue participation in the Retirement Plan in 1999 in connection with an election concerning participation offered to employees, and whose base salary plus target variable compensation payout under the Company's variable compensation plan exceeded the maximum amount of compensation taken into account under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code ("Section 401(a)(17) limits") may become a member upon notice of eligibility by the Company.
Employees who became members under the SERP prior to January 1, 2003 receive a retirement benefit in the form of a life annuity based on a percentage of their final average compensation multiplied by their credited service with the Company less their benefit under the Retirement Plan. Employees who become members on or after January 1, 2003 receive a retirement benefit in the form of a life annuity equal to 1.5% of the member's compensation in excess of the Section 401(a)(17) limits for each year with the Company (but only 1% for each year over 35).
In order to comply with Section 409A, the restated SERP provides that benefits will begin on the later of the employee's termination of employment or his or her social security retirement age. Benefits may be paid in different forms of life annuity elected by the employee.
The SERP is unfunded and paid solely from the Company's general assets.
Please refer to the amended and restated SERP, which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, for the complete terms of the SERP.
Teradyne, Inc. Supplemental Savings Plan
At its meeting on May 24-25, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an amendment and restatement of the Teradyne, Inc. Supplemental Savings Plan (the "Supplemental Plan"). The Supplemental Plan permits eligible employees, including executive officers, to elect to defer a portion of their compensation and to receive certain Company matching contributions. The primary purpose of the restatement is to conform the terms of the Supplemental Plan to the requirements of Section 409A.
The Company may designate any highly compensated or managerial employees as eligible to make deferral elections under the Supplemental Plan. Prior to the beginning of each plan year, an eligible employee may elect to defer up to that percentage of his or her compensation which the Company establishes as the limit on deferral of compensation in each year. Compensation for purposes of this deferral is compensation as defined under the Teradyne, Inc. Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan") but without "VC Awards" (which are amounts of incentive remuneration payable under the Company's variable compensation plan) and only in excess of certain dollar amounts set by the Company each year. Any eligible employee may also defer up to 85% of his or her VC Awards in any year. In addition the Company will make certain matching contributions with respect to these deferrals.
Amounts deferred and the matching contributions are treated as invested in such investment choices as the plan administrator makes available. The matching contributions are subject to vesting over time. Amounts deferred after 2004 are paid either upon termination of employment or on a date selected by the participant at the time he or she makes the deferral election. All distributions are made in a single lump sum, in cash.
The Supplemental Plan is unfunded and paid solely from the Company's general assets.
Please refer to the amended and restated Supplemental Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, for the complete terms of the Plan.
 
Concurrent with the adoption of the Plan described above in Item 1.01, the Company has terminated the following plans: the Teradyne, Inc. 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and the Teradyne, Inc. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each as described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of this termination, no additional option grants or awards may be issued by the Company under these plans, while all options and awards currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect.
 
The exhibit listed below and in the accompanying Exhibit Index is furnished as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors, effective January 1, 2001, and amended as of March 1, 2003, (the "Prior Plan") which provides each Non-Employee Director of the Company with an election to defer receipt of his or her Compensation from the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company wishes to amend and restate such Prior Plan to comply with Section 409A with respect to Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 and expand the elections permitted under the Prior Plan.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby amends and restates the Prior Plan to read in its entirety as set forth below, as so amended and restated (the "Plan"). The Plan has been operated in compliance with Section 409A since January 1, 2005 with respect to amounts subject to Section 409A. This amendment and restatement is intended to memorialize any changes in operation of the Plan as of that date as required by Section 409A. All other changes are effective as otherwise provided herein.
1. .
Eligibility
Each person who is a Non-Employee Director on December 1, 2004 is eligible to participate in the Plan for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2005. All other persons who are Non-Employee Directors on December 1 of any calendar year beginning in 2005 are eligible to participate in the Plan Year beginning the immediately following January 1. A Non-Employee Director who is eligible to participate may become a Participant by making a deferral election with respect to Compensation payable in the following Plan Year under Section 2. Eligibility to participate in the Plan for any Non-Employee Director automatically ends upon the termination of the individual's status as a member of the Board of Directors. If the Non-Employee Director becomes an Employee then any deferral election for Compensation payable in the Plan Year in which such employment commences shall remain in effect for the balance of the Plan Year but no further deferral elections may be made under the Plan.
2. .
Participation
A. Each Non-Employee Director who makes an election to defer the receipt of Compensation for any Plan Year must complete a Deferral Election Form, no later than the December 1 prior to the first day of the Plan Year with respect to which it is intended to be effective and deliver such completed form to the Company's HR director. A Deferral Election Form may be modified or withdrawn by the Participant prior to December 1 preceding the Plan Year to which it relates. The last completed form delivered to the HR director prior to or on
 
December 1 and not withdrawn as of that date, shall be considered the Deferral Election Form for the upcoming Plan Year and shall be irrevocable after such December 1.
B. Each Non-Employee Director who does not timely complete and deliver a Deferral Election Form for any Plan Year shall not defer receipt of any Compensation for such Plan Year and shall receive any and all Compensation to which he or she is entitled during such Plan Year in accordance with the Company's customary practices.
3. .
Elections
The Deferral Election Form for each Plan Year Deferral shall include the following elections:
A. An election to defer all the cash Compensation or, effective for Plan Years beginning January 1, 2007, all the Shares or both that are otherwise payable to the Non-Employee Director in the next Plan Year.
B. An election of the manner in which the cash portion of the Plan Year Deferral shall be allocated under the terms of Section 4(B)(1), as amended from time to time.
C. An election as to whether the Plan Year Deferral is payable, on distribution, in a lump sum or, effective for Plan Years beginning January 1, 2007, such number of annual installments (up to a maximum of 15) as the Non-Employee Director elects.
4. .
Accounting
A. The Company or its designee shall establish an account for each Participant for recordkeeping purposes only, including sufficient subaccounts to reflect all of Participant's elections in Section 3 for all such Participant's Plan Year Deferrals. The account and subaccounts are intended only for the purposes of determining the amounts to be distributed to the Participant under the Plan. Grandfathered Accounts shall be subject only to the terms of the Plan which were in effect under the Prior Plan, unless the Board elects at any time, to make them subject to the terms of the amended and restated Plan by a resolution to that effect.
B. The account and subaccount shall be adjusted as follows:
1. Cash deferred by any Participant will be allocated, in accordance with the Participant's election, to either (a) a notional account, or (b) a Deferred Stock Unit account ("DSU Account").
a. . Any amount which the Participant has allocated to a notional account, shall be credited with earnings, quarterly, at the rate in effect at the beginning of each Plan Year on 10 year Treasury Notes.
Notional Account
b. . Any amount which the Participant has allocated to the DSU Account will be converted into a number of Deferred Stock Units on the date the cash amounts deferred would have been paid to the Participant. The number of Deferred Stock Units credited to the Participant's DSU Account with respect to each cash deferral shall be determined by dividing the cash amount deferred by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on such date. If any cash dividends are subsequently declared with respect to the Common Stock then the cash that would
DSU Account
 
have been paid to the Participant as dividends if he or she had owned the number of whole shares of Common Stock represented by the Deferred Stock Units shall, on the date such dividend is paid, be credited to the notional account of the Participant with respect to the Plan Year Deferral to which such Deferred Stock Units relate and shall thereafter be credited with earnings as provided in Section 4(B)(1)(a).
2. Any Shares deferred by the Participant shall be separately accounted for under this Section 4(B)(2), in a subaccount of the DSU Account. The number of Shares deferred shall also be converted into Deferred Stock Units, crediting the Participant with one Deferred Stock Unit for each Share deferred. Any Shares which are not vested at the time they are credited to the DSU Account shall be continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement evidencing the award of such Shares. Any cash dividends payable with respect to the deferred Shares shall be treated as specified in Section 4(B)(1)(b) and shall vest in accordance with the terms applicable to the Shares.
5. .
Voting and Dividend Rights in Deferred Stock Units
No Participant shall be entitled to any voting rights or to receive (except as provided in Section 4(B)) any dividends with respect to any amounts or Shares treated as converted into Deferred Stock Units.
6. .
Distributions
A. . Distributions of each Plan Year Deferral shall be made as a lump sum, or in installments, in accordance with the terms of the Deferral Election Form the Participant has completed with respect the Plan Year Deferral. A Participant shall become entitled to distributions following his or her separation from service as defined in Section 409A. Such distributions shall be made or commence within 90 days after the date of the Participant's separation from service, subject to the provisions of Section 6(F). If distributions are to be made in installments then each annual installment shall be made on or about the anniversary of the first installment distribution, except that if the first installment is delayed in accordance with Section 6(F), then each successive annual installment will be made on the 90
Generally
th
day following the anniversary of the Participant's separation from service.
B. . Any distributions of a Plan Year Deferral to be made in a lump sum shall consist of (i) cash, which is an amount equal to the aggregate balance in the Participant's notional account with respect to such Plan Year Deferral on the distribution date, and (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of vested Deferred Stock Units with respect to such Plan Year Deferral in the Participant's DSU Account on the distribution date. Any unvested Deferred Stock Units shall be forfeited upon the Participant's termination of service as a member of the Board of Directors. The cash and the shares of Common Stock may be distributed separately and at different times within the 90 day payment period.
Lump Sum
C. . Each installment distribution of any Plan Year Deferral shall consist of (i) such amount of cash as is determined by dividing the aggregate balance in the Participant's notional account with respect to such Plan Year Deferral on the date of such installment
Installments
 
distribution by the total number of remaining installment distributions elected by the Participant in his or her Deferral Election Form with respect to such Plan Year Deferral and (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of vested Deferred Stock Units in the Participant's DSU Account with respect to such Plan Year Deferral on the date of such installment distribution divided by the total number of remaining installment distributions elected by the Participant in his or her Deferral Election Form with respect to such Plan Year Deferral; provided that the number of shares of Common Stock distributed may be rounded up or down by one share for ease of administration.
D. . Amounts allocated to the notional account shall be distributed in cash and amounts allocated to DSU Account shall be distributed in shares of Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock distributed under the Plan shall be issued from either the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan of the Company (the "2006 Compensation Plan") with respect to any Shares deferred subsequent to the adoption of the 2006 Compensation Plan by the Company's shareholders, or the Company's 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan with respect to any Shares deferred prior to the adoption of the 2006 Compensation Plan by the Company's shareholders. Distribution shall be made to the Participant, or if the Participant has died to the Participant's Beneficiary. The Company may distribute the value of any fractional Deferred Stock Unit in cash, based on the Fair Market Value on the date any shares of Common Stock are distributed.
Form of Distribution
E. . If the Participant dies prior to the total distribution of his or her account then the vested balance that is undistributed at the time of the Participant's death, notwithstanding any prior election by the Participant for installment distributions, shall be distributed to the Participant's Beneficiary, in a lump sum, within 90 days following the Participant's death.
Death
F. . If at the time of separation from service the Participant is considered a specified employee as defined in Section 409A then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the distribution of his or her account shall not be made, or commence, until six months and one day after such separation from service, but installments shall thereafter be distributed as if the initial installment had been made on the date of separation.
Specified Employee
G. . Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of the Plan, in accordance with Section 409A the Participants who have previously made a proper election to defer Compensation for 2005 or 2006 may designate, in such manner as the HR director determines, prior to December 31, 2006, whether such Plan Year Deferrals shall be distributed in a lump sum or in installments, and if in installments, the number of such installments.
Special 2006 Election

Amendments and Termination
The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, which may include, without limitation, action to prohibit any future deferral under the Plan; provided that no such action shall decrease the value of the Participant's account with respect to Deferral Elections made prior to such termination or amendment and such amendment or termination shall be consistent with Section 409A.

Any such amendment, modification, or termination shall not reduce or diminish the value of the benefit to be paid hereunder prior to the date of such amendment. Distribution of all benefits on termination of the Plan shall be made in such manner permitted by and subject to such conditions and limitations as imposed by Section 409A including, without limitation, (a) a termination within 12 months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the Code or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(A), (b) a termination within 30 days preceding or 12 months following a change in control event as defined under Section 409A, and (c) a termination of the Plan if all similar arrangements sponsored by the Employer that would be aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A are terminated, subject in each event to compliance with all provisions of Section 409A with respect to such events of termination. Notice of such amendment or termination shall be given in writing to each Member and Beneficiary of a deceased Member having an interest in the Plan. The Employer may, at any time, provide for the cessation of the accrual of benefits under the Plan for some or all of the Members.

Teradyne, Inc. established the Teradyne, Inc. Supplemental Savings Plan (the "Plan") effective as of December 1, 1994 for the benefit of a select group of its highly paid employees. The Plan was subsequently amended by the First Amendment, which was generally effective as of January 1, 2002. The Plan has been operated in compliance with Code Section 409A since January 1, 2005 with respect to amounts subject to Code Section 409A. This amendment and restatement is intended to memorialize any changes in operation in the Plan as of January 1, 2005 as required by Code Section 409A. All other changes are effective as otherwise provided herein.
Teradyne, Inc. adopted this written amendment and restatement of the Plan on May 24-25, 2006 for elective and non-elective amounts deferred on or after January 1, 2005 and for amounts deferred before January 1, 2005 that were not both earned and vested on December 31, 2004. The Plan as amended and restated is intended to conform with the requirements of Code Section 409A and shall be administered in a manner consistent therewith. All amounts deferred under the Plan that are subject to Code Section 409A shall be separately accounted for and administered within each Participant's Account.
Amounts attributable to a Participant's vested account under the Plan on December 31, 2004 shall be separately accounted for in each Participant's Grandfathered Account. Elections made with respect to amounts credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account and amounts payable from a Participant's Grandfathered Account shall be subject to the provisions of the Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004 and the law as in effect prior to Code Section 409A.
The purpose of the Plan is to permit eligible employees to elect to defer receipt of compensation otherwise payable currently and to enable the employer to credit eligible employees with matching contributions.
The Plan is intended to be a "plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA and shall be administered in a manner consistent therewith.
Pronouns used in the Plan are in the masculine gender but include the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Wherever used herein, the following terms have the meanings set forth below, unless a different meaning is clearly required by the context:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A new deferral agreement must be timely executed for each Plan Year during which the Eligible Employee elects to defer compensation. An Eligible Employee who does not timely execute a deferral agreement shall be deemed to have elected zero deferrals for such Plan Year.
A deferral agreement may be changed or revoked at any time during the respective periods specified in Section 3.4. A deferral agreement becomes irrevocable at the close of the respective period and remains in effect throughout the applicable Plan Year even if the Eligible Employee transfers from one Employer to another Employer.
 
 
 
Except as otherwise provided below, an employee who is classified or designated as an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year may elect to defer
 
Compensation and/or VC Award otherwise payable during the remainder of such Plan Year in accordance with the rules of this Section 3.4 by executing a deferral agreement within the thirty (30) day beginning on the date the employee is classified or designated as an Eligible Employee. If a VC Award is based on a specific performance period that begins before the Eligible Employee executes his deferral agreement, the election will be deemed to apply to that portion of the VC Award equal to the total amount of the VC Award for the performance period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the election to the total number of days in the performance period. The rules of this paragraph shall not apply if the Eligible Employee has ever participated or is participating in a "plan" within the meaning of Prop. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c) sponsored by the Employer.
 
The permissible distribution events are Separation from Service and a specified date that is at least five years after the first day of the Plan Year during which the related deferral agreement is effective. Payment will occur following the distribution event within the time period required by Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder.
All distributions will be made in a single lump sum.
A Participant may make new distribution elections with respect to amounts subject to Code Section 409A if the elections are made no later than December 31, 2006, except that the Participant cannot in 2006 change distribution elections with respect to amounts that would otherwise have become payable in 2006 or cause payments to be made in 2006. The new distribution elections may apply to amounts deferred before the date of the election and can be made without regard to Code Sections 409A(a)(3) and (4) and any inconsistent provisions in the Plan to the contrary. A Participant who fails to make a new distribution election in accordance with this Section 3.6 with respect to an amount for which a valid election under Code Section 409A has not been made will be deemed to have elected a lump sum distribution upon his Separation from Service.
 
 
 
The amount of Matching Contributions credited to the Account of each eligible Participant shall be calculated separately with respect to his Compensation deferrals and separately with respect to his VC Award deferrals and shall equal the sum of the amounts so determined.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A copy of the death notice or other sufficient documentation must be filed with and approved by the Administrator. If upon the death of the Participant there is, in the opinion of the Administrator, no designated Beneficiary for part or all of the Participant's Account, such amount will be paid to his estate in a single lump sum payment (such estate shall be deemed to be the Beneficiary for purposes of the Plan).
The balance or remaining balance credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months of the termination of the arrangements, (d) the Plan Sponsor does not adopt a new arrangement that would be aggregated with any terminated arrangement under Prop. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c) at any time within the five year period following the date of termination of the arrangement. The Plan Sponsor also reserves the right to terminate the Plan under such conditions and events as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
 
 
Whether a Change in Control has occurred will be determined by the Plan Sponsor in accordance with the rules and definitions set forth in this Section 8.5. A distribution to a Participant will be treated as occurring upon a Change in Control if the Plan Sponsor terminates the Plan and distributes the Participant's benefits within twelve months of a Change in Control as provided in Section 8.3.
 
 
 
Mutual and cooperative corporations are treated as having stock for purposes of this Section 8.5.
 
 
 
the relevant corporation identified in Section 8.5(a) for which no other corporation is a majority shareholder for purposes of Section 8.5(a). In the absence of an event described in Section 8.5(d)(i) or (ii), a change in the effective control of a corporation will not have occurred. A change in effective control may also occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction has a change in the ownership of such corporation as described in Section 8.5(c) or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of such corporation as described in Section 8.5(e). If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation within the meaning of this Section 8.5(d), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation or to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation within the meaning of Section 8.5(c). For purposes of this Section 8.5(d), persons will or will not be considered to be acting as a group in accordance with rules similar to those set forth in Section 8.5(c) with the following exception. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
 
 
acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the corporation, or (iv) an entity, at least fifty (50%) of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in Section 8.5(e)(iii). For purposes of the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided, a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of assets.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions, (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for such person to perfect such claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and (iv) information as to the steps to be taken if the person wishes to submit a request for review. Such notification will be given within 90 days after the claim is received by the Administrator (or within 180 days, if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, and if written notice of such extension and circumstances is given to such person within the initial 90-day period). If such notification is not given within such period, the claim will be considered denied as of the last day of such period and such person may request a review of his claim.
 
The Employer against whom the claim is brought shall bear all costs of an arbitration, except that the arbitrator shall have the power to apportion among the parties other expenses such as prehearing discovery, travel costs and attorney's fees. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any such payment to the extent thereof, shall discharge the liability of the Plan for the payment of benefits hereunder to such recipient.
 
 
 
 
 
relations order within the meaning of Code Section 414(p)(1)(B), (2) to comply with a certificate of divestiture as defined in Code Section 1043(b)(2), (3) to pay the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) on compensation deferred under the Plan, (4) to pay the income tax under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of any FICA tax described in (3) and to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding Code Section 3401, wages and taxes, and (5) to pay the amount required to be included in gross income as a result of the failure of the Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. The total payment under (3) or (4) shall, in no event, exceed the aggregate of the FICA tax and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax. The total payment under (5) shall, in no event, exceed the amount required to be included as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Teradyne Announces Second Quarter 2006 Results and Authorization of Stock Repurchase Program
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)July 19, 2006Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $391.6 million for the second quarter of 2006. Net income in the quarter was $82.4 million, or $0.40 per share on a GAAP basis, and $63.3 million, or $0.31 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the second quarter were $403.7 million, up 11% sequentially.
"We had an exceptional quarter, seeing very strong demand for our Semiconductor Test products with short lead times, and steady growth in our system level test businesses." said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Once again, our FLEX System-On-Chip tester led the way with record orders. We also had our highest Semiconductor Test bookings in Japan and Korea, combined with much stronger subcontract test ordering."
Sales in the third quarter of 2006 are expected to be between $340 million and $370 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.17 and $0.24.
In addition, Teradyne announced today that its Board of Directors authorized a Stock Repurchase Program. Under the Program, the company is permitted to spend an aggregate of $400 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means, over the next two years. Shares are to be repurchased at the company's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. A reconciliation of each GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; incoming quality of components or raw materials; insufficient or excess inventory; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing, information technology and engineering activities); the risks of potential environmental liability; any material litigation against Teradyne; the ability to attract and retain key employees; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other charges, net, and certain inventory provisions. GAAP requires that these costs and charges be included in determining Net Income/(Loss) and Net Income/(Loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
See Items 5.02 and 8.01 below.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
(d) On October 2, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") elected Edwin J. Gillis as a new Class III director and also appointed him to the Audit Committee. On this same date, the Board affirmatively determined that Mr. Gillis has no material relationship with Teradyne and is independent within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.
In connection with his election, Mr. Gillis automatically received, on the date of his election, an initial equity award of 11,398 restricted stock units in accordance with Teradyne's 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan and the terms of the Director Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, a form of which was previously approved by the Board and is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Under the terms of such Grant Agreement, the award to Mr. Gillis will vest 100% on the first anniversary of the grant date. In accordance with Teradyne's existing non-employee director compensation policy, Mr. Gillis will be compensated at a rate of $50,000 per year. On October 3, 2006, Teradyne issued a press release announcing Mr. Gillis' election. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events
On October 2, 2006, the Board also appointed James W. Bagley to serve as the new Chair of the Audit Committee to fill a vacancy created by Paul J. Tufano's resignation from the Audit Committee. Mr. Tufano resigned from the Audit Committee and as its Chair because he serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Solectron, Inc. ("Solectron") and Teradyne's purchases from Solectron for 2006 are expected to exceed two percent (2%) of Solectron's 2006 consolidated gross revenues. In such case, Mr. Tufano would no longer qualify as an independent director within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Tufano will continue to remain on the Board. In accordance with Teradyne's existing non-employee director compensation policy, Mr. Tufano will no longer be compensated for serving as the Audit Committee Chair and Mr. Bagley will begin receiving an additional $10,000 per year compensation as the Chair of the Audit Committee.

Exhibit 99.1
Teradyne Announces Third Quarter 2006 Results
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)October 18, 2006Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $359 million for the third quarter of 2006. Net income in the quarter was $60.6 million, or $0.31 per share. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $64.5 million, or $0.33 per share on a GAAP basis, and $46.0 million, or $0.24 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the third quarter were $239 million.
"We had another solid quarter of financial performance with strong gross margins and record cash flow," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "After almost two years of expansion, our customers have pulled back as expected. However, with more than 1,000 FLEX systems installed at customers, and with tight cost controls in place, we are well positioned for the next phase of industry growth."
Sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.01 and $0.05.
During the third quarter of 2006, Teradyne repurchased 8.5 million shares of its common stock for $110 million under its previously announced Stock Repurchase Program.
In addition, on October 16, 2006, Teradyne paid off the outstanding balance, approximately $261 million aggregate principal amount, of its 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2006 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; incoming quality of components or raw materials; insufficient or excess inventory; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing, information technology and engineering activities); the risks of potential environmental liability; any material litigation against Teradyne; the ability to attract and retain key employees; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other charges, net, and certain inventory provisions. GAAP requires that these costs and charges be included in determining Net Income/(Loss) and Net Income/(Loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Teradyne Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results
NORTH READING, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE)January 24, 2007  Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $263 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income in the fourth quarter was $10.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, and $11.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the fourth quarter were $287.5 million.
For fiscal 2006, sales were $1.38 billion. Net income for the year was $198.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; incoming quality of components or raw materials; insufficient or excess inventory; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing, information technology and engineering activities); the risks of potential environmental liability; any material litigation against Teradyne; the ability to attract and retain key employees; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
 
TERADYNE, INC. REPORT FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2006
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except per share amounts)
 
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands)
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other, net, and certain inventory provisions, as well as adjustments to profit sharing and taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining Net Income/(Loss) and Net Income/(Loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

NORTH READING, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE) April 18, 2007Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $258 million for the first quarter of 2007.

Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter was $8.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Bookings for the first quarter were $253 million.

Recent design-ins for our FLEX (TM) and J750 systems in these key areas are fueling our increased revenue projections going forward."
 
Guidance for the second quarter of 2007 is for sales of $275 million to $300 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.08 and $0.13.

Exhibit 99.1
Teradyne Reports Third Quarter, 2007 Results
NORTH READING, Mass.(BUSINESS WIRE)October 17, 2007 Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $299 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net income was $41 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $35 million, or $0.19 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $32 million, or $0.17 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the third quarter were $273 million.
"We continue to make solid progress in new design wins, despite the third quarter decline in semiconductor test bookings," said Michael Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Although tester utilization levels remained very high in the quarter, customers continue to be cautious about adding capacity in the short term."
Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2007 is for sales between $250 million and $275 million, with earnings between $0.04 and $0.10 per diluted share.
As of October 17, 2007, Teradyne completed its authorized stock repurchase program. Since the inception of the program in the third quarter of 2006, Teradyne has repurchased 27,947,230 shares at an average price of $14.31.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in
general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally, disruptions, delays or an inadequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; the operational effectiveness of our outsourced manufacturing activities, and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and; our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

The division's assets and liabilities have been included within discontinued operations.
GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share refer to income from continuing operations or income per common share from continuing operations excluding in-process research and development, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provisions, certain other income and certain tax related items, as well as adjustments to profit sharing and taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 11, 2007, Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") and its newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, NAC Equipment Corporation (the "Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Nextest Systems Corporation ("Nextest"), pursuant to which the Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Nextest, par value $0.001 per share, at a price of $20.00 per share, net to the selling stockholders in cash, less any required tax withholding and without interest thereon (such amount, the "Offer Price"). Following the consummation of the Offer, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Nextest (the "Merger"), and all shares of Nextest common stock not acquired in the Offer will convert into the right to receive the Offer Price (other than shares held by holders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law). Nextest will then become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties.
The Company agreed that the Merger Sub would commence the Offer within 10 business days after the date of the Merger Agreement, and that the Offer will remain open for at least 20 business days.
The Merger Sub's obligation to accept for payment and pay for shares of Nextest common stock tendered in the Offer is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things: (i) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Nextest common stock on a fully-diluted basis shall have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not properly withdrawn (the "Minimum Condition"), (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and applicable foreign statutes and regulations, (iii) the accuracy of representations made by Nextest in the Merger Agreement, (iv) compliance by Nextest with its covenants in the Merger Agreement and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect on Nextest.
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Nextest has granted the Merger Sub an irrevocable option to purchase that number of newly-issued Shares that is equal to one share more than the amount needed to give the Merger Sub ownership of 90% of outstanding Nextest common stock on a fully-diluted basis (the "Top-Up Option"). The Top-Up Option is exercisable only if, among other things, the Minimum Condition is satisfied. The Merger Sub will pay to Nextest the Offer Price for each share acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated in this report by reference.
The Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, the Merger Sub or Nextest. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or Nextest or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. In addition, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure
schedule that the parties have exchanged. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts, since (i) they were made only as of the date of such agreement or a prior, specified date, (ii) in some cases they are subject to qualifications with respect to materiality, knowledge and/or other matters, and (iii) they may be modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedule. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's or Nextest's public disclosures.
Important Additional Information Will Be Filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)
This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of Nextest, Inc. The Merger Sub has not commenced the Offer for shares of Nextest stock described in this document.
Upon commencement of the Offer, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits, including the offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, and other related documents. Following commencement of the Offer, Nextest will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9. Shareholders should read the offer to purchase and solicitation/recommendation statement and the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits when such documents are filed and become available, as they will contain important information about the Offer.
Shareholders can obtain these documents when they are filed and become available free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or from Teradyne, Inc. by directing a request to Investor Relations, Teradyne, Inc., 600 Riverpark Drive, North Reading, Massachusetts 01864, or from Nextest Systems Corporation by directing a request to Investor Relations, Nextest Systems Corporation, 875 Embedded Way, San Jose, California 95138.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by
management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. A reconciliation of each GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication. Except as otherwise required by law, Teradyne disclaims any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of development occurring after the date of this press release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding future business prospects and market conditions and the proposed acquisition of Nextest Systems Corporation. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: conditions affecting the markets in which Teradyne or Nextest operates; delays in new product introductions; lack of customer acceptance of new products; the parties' ability to satisfy the tender offer and merger agreement conditions and consummate the transaction; Teradyne's ability to successfully integrate Nextest's operations with its existing operations; the ability to realize anticipated synergies and cost savings; and other events, factors and risks
previously and from time to time disclosed in filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, Teradyne's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share refer to income from continuing operations or income per common share from continuing operations excluding in-process research and development, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provisions, certain other income and certain tax related items, as well as adjustments to profit sharing and taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Nextest stockholders received $20.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes, for each Nextest share.

Teradyne has estimated the fair value of other intangible assets using the income approach to value these identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to change upon management's review of the final valuation. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lines. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at January 24, 2008 (dollars in thousands):
 
Tangible assets and liabilities
Tangible assets were recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value, except for inventory. Teradyne increased Nextest's historical net carrying amount of certain inventory by $4.3 million in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet to reflect its fair market value. The property and equipment, net are recorded at carrying value, which Teradyne believes approximates fair value.
Liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value and the amount expected to be paid, except for deferred revenue and deferred rent. Deferred revenue and deferred rent have been reduced by $5.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet to reflect their fair market values.
3. HISTORICAL INFORMATION
Nextest's historical financial information as of September 29, 2007, for the three fiscal quarters ended September 29, 2007 and for the four fiscal quarters ended December 23, 2006 is derived from Nextest's historical financial statements. Nextest's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in June; and its historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to Teradyne's December 31 fiscal year end and September 30 interim reporting date by adding subsequent interim period results to their most recent fiscal year-end information and deducting the comparable preceding year interim period results. Certain reclassifications have been made to these financial statements to conform to the presentation used in Teradyne's historical financial statements. Such reclassifications had no effect on Nextest's previously reported net income or income from continuing operations.
4. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet:
A. To record the cash paid to acquire the shares of Nextest of $367.8 million and transactions costs of $6.1 million.
B. To reclassify Nextest field service inventory to property, plant and equipment; consistent with Teradyne's accounting policy.
C. To increase the carrying value of inventories to estimated selling prices less the cost of disposal and selling effort, including an appropriate return on the sales effort.
D. To adjust the value of deferred taxes as of the acquisition date.
E. To record the preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill and intangible assets as though the acquisition had occurred on the balance sheet date. The pro forma adjustment for goodwill differs from the amount shown in Note 2 as the result of different tangible net asset balances as September 30, 2007 (the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet) and January 24, 2008 (the date of the acquisition).
F. To record preliminary acquisition-related liabilities of $2.3 million for severance costs associated with Nextest employees of $2.1 million and $0.2 million of estimated costs related to the consolidation of certain Nextest foreign legal entities with existing Teradyne legal entities.
G. To record preliminary fair value adjustments to Nextest's deferred revenue.
H. To record $37.9 million of deferred tax liabilities related to acquired amortizable intangible assets net of $35.3 million reduction in Teradyne valuation allowance, recorded as a result of the acquisition.
I. To record preliminary fair value adjustments to Nextest's deferred rent.
J. To record the following adjustments to shareholders' equity (in thousands):
 
K. To record amortization of intangible assets acquired.
L. To record forgone interest income resulting from cash utilized in connection with the acquisition, based on actual cash paid for the acquisition and acquisition costs, and the historical interest rate (5%) earned on Teradyne's cash and cash equivalents.
M. To record tax benefits associated with the pro forma adjustments recorded in the condensed combined statements of operations on the reduction of interest income.
N. To eliminate Nextest shares acquired as part of the acquisition. Note that an adjustment has been made for the impact of assumed stock options and restricted stock units as they would have been dilutive.
5. NONRECURRING CHARGES
The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively, do not reflect the impact on cost of sales of $4.3 million to reflect acquired inventory at fair value and on operating expenses an in-process research and development expense of $1.1 million. Under SEC rules and regulations relating to pro forma financial statements, these amounts are considered to be nonrecurring charges and are excluded from the pro forma statements of operations. However, Teradyne's future statements of operations will be impacted by these pro forma adjustments.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results.

its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share refer to income from continuing operations or income per common share from continuing operations excluding in-process research and development, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provisions and fair value adjustment relating to Nextest, interest and other, net, and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as adjustments to profit sharing due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Grant #XX
 
This award is governed by and subject to Teradyne's 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which, together with the following provisions, controls the meaning of terms and the rights of the recipient. Capitalized and defined terms used and not defined below will have the meaning set forth in the Plan. In the event of any inconsistencies or differences between the Plan and these terms, the Plan shall prevail.
1. Award Grant, Vesting and Transfer
Teradyne hereby grants to the recipient the right to receive up to that number of shares of Teradyne common stock as is set forth on the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant attached hereto.

(a) Payment of par value.
 None of this grant will be vested on the Effective Date. The number of Actual Performance-Based Shares that will be allowed to vest is uncertain at the time of the grant but is expected to be determined near the one-year anniversary of the grant, based on the determination by the Committee or Teradyne's Board of Directors of the Performance Percentage. The "Performance Percentage" is a percentage ranging from 0-200% determined using criteria similar to that which was used over the prior year to determine the annual variable compensation payout. The Performance Percentage shall be multiplied against the Target Performance-Based Shares granted to derive the number of Actual Performance-Based Shares which will vest on the third year anniversary of the Effective Date. The portion of the grant that is not allowed to vest will be forfeited. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the right to accelerate the date that any installment of this award becomes vested in the event of disability, death, retirement or upon the acquisition of control of Teradyne by another entity.

(c) This award will not vest further after termination of employment or other business relationship except in limited certain circumstances. 
Employment or another business relationship shall be considered as continuing uninterrupted during any bona fide leave of absence (such as those attributable to illness or military obligations) provided that the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days or, in the case of an employee, if longer, any period during which the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute. A bona fide leave of absence with the written approval of the Committee shall not be considered an interruption of employment or other business relationship, provided that such written approval contractually obligates the Company to continue the employment or other business relationship of the recipient after the approved period of absence.
The recipient shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any shares which may be covered by this award (including but not limited to the right to vote or to receive dividends) until the award is settled by issuance of shares to the recipient. All vested shares issued in respect of this award will be transferred or issued to the recipient (or his or her estate, in the event of his or her death) promptly after the date they vest but in any event within 2

Teradyne Announces Second Quarter, 2008 Results
NORTH READING, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE)  Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $318 million in the second quarter of 2008. Net income for the second quarter was $28.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, on a non-GAAP basis, and $11.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Bookings for the second quarter were $308 million.
"Our System-On-a-Chip (SOC) test business further strengthened in the second quarter, driven by record first-half demand in wireless test applications, however we saw a softening in memory test capacity-driven orders," said Mike Bradley Teradyne president and CEO. "Overall, our roll-out of new SOC test products is on track for the year."
Guidance for the third quarter of 2008 is for sales of $290 million to $310 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.10 and $0.15 on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP guidance excludes restructuring and other charges, net, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance.

Teradyne's earnings per share guidance is only provided on a non GAAP basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and
quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges, such as intangible asset amortization expense, other additional charges excluded from the non-GAAP measure are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events and unknown factors, such as the sale of a facility.

NORTH READING, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE)  September 2, 2008 
Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) and Eagle Test Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:EGLT) today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement under which Teradyne will acquire Eagle Test. Teradyne is a world leader in System-On-a-Chip (SOC) semiconductor test, while Eagle Test is a leading provider of analog, mixed-signal and radio frequency semiconductor test products.
Under the terms of the agreement, Eagle Test shareholders will receive $15.65 per share in cash. The aggregate purchase price is expected to be approximately $250 million, net of cash acquired, and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments. Teradyne has secured a bridge financing commitment in connection with the transaction.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to 2009 non-GAAP EPS, after excluding purchase accounting effects.
"We're very pleased to be combining forces with Eagle Test," said Mike Bradley, president and CEO of Teradyne. "Eagle Test has a solid franchise in power management and other analog-dominant IC test applications, which will complement the SOC test solutions provided by our FLEX and J750 test systems. We plan to put the full weight of our worldwide distribution organization behind Eagle Test's ETS product line so customers can benefit from this very cost effective test platform."
"I am extremely excited about the opportunity to combine the effectiveness of Eagle Test's products and the strength of our financial model with Teradyne's tremendous market presence and worldwide distribution and support organization," said Len Foxman, CEO, president and chairman of Eagle Test. "Teradyne's sales and marketing infrastructure, along with their global customer relationships, will greatly accelerate Eagle Test's mission to deliver strong customer value and grow our business."
The acquisition will be subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Eagle Test shareholders, the receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to Eagle Test. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008. After the closing, Eagle Test will be run as a business unit within Teradyne's Semiconductor Test Division.

Non-GAAP Guidance
The expected impact of the transaction to Teradyne's earnings per share is only provided on a non-GAAP basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the purchase accounting amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP guidance. This non-GAAP guidance is provided in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP guidance helps indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before purchase accounting effects, gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operations. Teradyne believes this non-GAAP information will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. The presentation of non-GAAP information is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On September 1, 2008, Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Eagle Test Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Eagle"), and Turin Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of the Company and Eagle.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Eagle (the "Merger"), with Eagle continuing after the Merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Eagle's common stock will convert into the right to receive $15.65 per share in cash. In addition, outstanding options granted pursuant to Eagle's equity incentive plans will partially or fully accelerate and will be assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger. Based on the number of shares of Eagle common stock outstanding as of August 29, 2008, this represents a total purchase price of approximately $250 million, net of cash acquired and including the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments.
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties. Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things: (i) the requisite approval of Eagle's stockholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and applicable foreign statutes and regulations, (iii) the accuracy of representations made by Eagle in the Merger Agreement, (iv) the material performance by Eagle of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect on Eagle.
The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights and provides that if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances Eagle may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $11,500,000.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated in this report by reference.
The Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, the Merger Sub or Eagle. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. Certain of the representations and warranties have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (i) are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure schedule that the parties have exchanged, (ii) were made only as of the date of such agreement or a prior, specified date, and (iii) in some cases are subject to qualifications with respect to materiality, knowledge and/or other matters, including standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's or Eagle's public disclosures. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or Eagle or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
Stockholder Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and certain executive officers, directors and stockholders of Eagle holding shares of Eagle common stock representing approximately 39.5% of the outstanding shares as of August 29, 2008 have entered into voting agreements (collectively, the "Stockholder Agreements"), pursuant to which such executive officers, directors and stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of capital stock of Eagle in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement and against any proposal made in opposition thereto.

("GSCP"), pursuant to which GSCP committed, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide the Company with a senior secured credit facility (the "Bridge Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of up to $175 million. The Bridge Facility is intended to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Merger to the extent the Company does not obtain alternative permanent financing. The availability of the Bridge Facility is subject to customary conditions precedent, including the Merger being consummated prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the funding of the Bridge Facility. The commitments under the Commitment Letter will terminate upon the first to occur of (i) the closing of the Merger, (ii) March 1, 2009 (to correspond with the outside date in the Merger Agreement), and (iii) certain other customary circumstances set forth in the Commitment Letter.
The Company's obligations under the Bridge Facility will be guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries (including, following the closing of the Merger, Eagle and its subsidiaries), and secured by the Company's and the subsidiary guarantors' assets, on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.

Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Kara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Teradyne to acquire Eagle Test conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Thank you. Mr. Newman, you may begin your conference
 
 
Tom Newman 
Teradyne, Inc.VP, Corporate Relations
Thank you, Kara, and good afternoon, everyone. I am joined this afternoon by our President and CEO, Mike Bradley, and by our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Beecher. We're here to discuss our announcement this morning of the signing of a definitive agreement for the class acquisition of Eagle Test systems by Teradyne. The press release detailing the transaction went out today a little before 8:00AM eastern time. A copy can be found on our website at www.teradyne.com, or you can attain one by calling our Investor Relations office at 978-370-2221. This call is being simultaneously webcast over our website at www.teradyne.com. Replays of this call will be available starting around 7:00PM this evening eastern time through September 16th.
In the course of this call we may make some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995 regarding the proposed acquisition of Eagle Test, the expected timetable for completing the acquisition, future business prospects and
market conditions and benefits and synergies of the transaction. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of management and are neither promises nor guarantees. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented  presently expected include: conditioning affecting the markets in which Eagle Test operates, the uncertainty of regulatory approvals, Teradyne's ability to successfully integrate Eagle Test operation with its existing operations, the ability to realize anticipated synergies and cost savings, and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time, disclosed in filings with the SEC including, but not limited to: Teradyne's annual report on form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and Eagle Test's annual report on form 10K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and Teradyne disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
And now on to the substance of the call. First, Greg Beecher will describe the details of the financial transaction and then Mike Bradley will discuss the strategic merits and benefits of the acquisition. Note that we intend to limit this call to 30 minutes, and that we will only entertain questions related to the acquisition. Greg.
 
 
Greg Beecher 
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
Thanks, Tom. From a financial lens the transaction is fairly straight forward. The acquisition will be an all (inaudible) under which Eagle Test stockholders will receive $15.65 per share in cash. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $250 million. This price is net of the cash acquired and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments. We have secured a bridge financing commitment should be need it to close the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2008. From an operating perspective, once the acquisition is consummated, Eagle Tests will operate as a new business unit within Teradyne with the full distribution and support of Teradyne behind it. We expect the transaction to be accretive to 2009 nonGAAP EPS after excluding purchase accounting effects. The acquisition will be subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of Eagle Test shareholders and receipt of clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act and the absence of the material adverse change with respect to Eagle Test. The acquisition will not require the approval of Teradyne shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mike
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to briefly outline the strategy of our acquisition of Eagle Test from the perspective our customers, our shareholders, and the employees of both companies. As you know, customers in the analog dominant IC space have been adopting Eagle Tests ETS line of testers due to cost effective performance characteristics. For more highly integrated system on chip designs they also invested in the analog plus digital performance of the FLEX family of testers from Teradyne. So these testers have had a very complimentary price performance set of attributes on customer sees floors. Therefore we intend to maintain both of these test platforms into the future for the unique value they provide to customers.
Now we'll obviously continue the intense active on-site support that both companies have offered in the past as we back these products for the long haul. Shareholder benefit is compelling, as Eagle Tests brings a strong financial track record to the table and is accretive to our own strengthened business model. Unlike combinations where one or both parties are underperforming, this is a combination that doesn't depend upon major renovation and product rationalization, and therefore we expect to hit the ground running with our combined product portfolio. So investors will see a combination of strong business models, very solid customer positions and product road maps that extend into the future. Now from an employee perspective we'll integrate the operations into our semi test operation as a business unit similar to what we've done with Nextest. We'll move quickly on the customer facing side of things so that our customer have a single interface to the combined business. I expect that we'll have little trouble aligning support resources in an effective way so that our customers don't see any interruptions in support of their equipment. I do want to say we've been very impressed with the engineering and support teams behind the Eagle Test product line, and I am sure we'll work very effectively in cross-pollinating design technology and test development strategies. Finally, our initial work with Len Foxman and his leadership team has convinced us that we're on the same page when it comes to core values, customer solutions, and financial discipline. So I'm very, very pleased that we're combining forces for the future. Now I want to open it up for any questions that you may have.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
 
 
Operator
(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello.
 
Jim Covello
Goldman, Sachs & CompanyAnalyst
Great. Good afternoon, guys, thanks so much. Just one question for me. Obviously I think the rationale for a deal makes a ton of sense, but why now, what was it about now especially after the target had a big runup in the stock that made it attractive today?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Well, Jim, it is not an instantaneous thing. We've obviously been talking, so I think in a broader context the why now was because both we and Eagle saw that we could get a lot more done together than separately. We have  they have got a very strong position here in the big A, analog dominant space, power management space, we adjoined that with the mixed signal capability of the FLEX. And we've got a very, very big strong footprint in terms of distribution, three times the number of sales, engineers, about six times the application force, so we both came to the joint belief that we could get a multiplier effect here, so it wasn't really a function of the last few days or last few weeks of stock price.
 
 
Jim Covello
Goldman, Sachs & CompanyAnalyst
How about like if I go back to this time last year, is there something that would have made this make less sense this time last year? I am just again trying to get a feel for timing and thoughts and if things  anything has changed to catalyze this?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
I don't think  I think it takes two to tango, so I think both of the companies were independently pursuing their business models. Both were making progress, and I think when we looked at each other we became increasingly attractive to one another in a combination, so while the chemical components were there a year ago at this time, they really hadn't catalyzed enough for us each to come to the table
 
 
Jim Covello
Goldman, Sachs & CompanyAnalyst
That makes sense. And a final question for me. Any element to this that there has been a bunch of consolidation now in the industry and sort of the domino effect that once a couple things happen everybody becomes more open-minded to it maybe?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
I think that is a little bit of it, but I think more substantial from our end was that Eagle is a strong player. They have  they really add something to our product line, so I don't think it is a matter of a rollup of the various players and trying to roll that and trying to get scale from it. It was they were attractive because of their strength, because of the product technology, they have about 1,700 ETS products in the install base, and we just think partnering with them as we did with Nextest we have two additional strong components to our product portfolio.
 
 
Jim Covello
Goldman, Sachs & CompanyAnalyst
Terrific. Thanks a lot. Congratulations.
 
 
Operator
Our next question comes from CJ Muse.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first off, I think in the past you've talked about low cost analyzers being roughly a $200 million market. And I guess the first question is, bringing Teradyne's technology to bear, including advanced RF and high frequency
technology, do you think you can grow that segment above and beyond the $200 million as a combined entity, and if so, where should we see that?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Well, we certainly intend to keep the investments in R&D that Eagle has underway, so we want to grow basically from the core technology that they're adding to their product. This segment is actually expected forecasted to grow at a higher rate that be the overall total  the total SOC market, but we're going to look as we are with Nextest. If there are things we can do in shared technology, to expand the applications of that product we're going to do that. I think you've heard and Len's prior calls that they want to expand into the discreet test arena and while it is not a small market, we see that as an adjacency that could be exploited.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
Okay. And then in terms of accreted active to an accretive on a nonGAAP basis, $250 million net cash, assuming 4% on your cash, that's about $10 million. So is that the sort of right ballpark number we should be thinking about in terms of synergies?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
In our modeling we assume that the costs will be higher than 4%. We assume that if we went to some type of financing it would be closer to 10%, so we weren't using 4%. It would be accretive to an attractive basis with say a 10% borrowing cost.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
Okay. So you're talking $20 plus million then in terms of synergies?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
No. No. If you looked at Eagle Test by itself, you would see that they are a very profitable company, and if we had zero synergies which we won't, Eagle Test would still be accretive. It is a very, very profitable company. There will be normal synergies you would expect, so this will be on a nonGAAP basis attractive accretion in 2009, and in our next call we'll provide more details on some of the components.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
Got you. And last question from me. You had $415 million net cash exiting the June quarter, $250 million out here. What's the right level of cash you think you need to run your existing business plus now pro forma for Eagle Test?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Well, there's a wide range, but we could operate in the neighborhood of $250 million if we wanted to quite comfortably. But we probably would have cash  should have cash at a higher amount. We might target somewhere in the $300 million to have some cash for other strategic opportunities, but somewhere in the $300 million range is where I expect us to end up.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
So in terms of the required capital then to make up the difference between what you would like tore cash, should we be thinking equity or debt?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
We would not look to the equity markets. We would be looking to some other type of financing, but we would not be looking to straight common. That would not be attractive to us.
 
 
CJ Muse
Lehman Brothers, Inc.Analyst
Great. Excellent. Thank you.
 
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Brett Hodess.
 
 
Brett Hodess
Merrill LynchAnalyst
I was wondering if you could give us some idea when you look at the accretive nature for next year what kind of revenue range you're thinking Eagle Test will contribute when you're making those kind of calculations, and if you think that the gross margin profile that Eagle Test has had in the past would still hold in that environment?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
We think the gross margin would still hold, and the revenue projections we have are similar to what Wall Street has. If you look at Wall Street estimates, that's the numbers that we used.
 
 
Brett Hodess
Merrill LynchAnalyst
Great. Thank you.
 
 
Operator
Your next question is from Satya Kumar.
 
 
Satya Kumar
Credit SuisseAnalyst
Yes. Hi. Congratulations on the acquisition. A little bit of math here. What's the market share that Eagle Test has in the [available] markets and power management right now and how much should we think of that increasing with distribution strength that you guys bring to the table here?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
We're not sure exactly about how much we can grow that. They have got an ambitious growth plan. We hope to be able to expand on that because of the larger distribution footprint, but if that market is $200 million to $300 million, they have got about $130 million. You have to take the discreet out of that number, so they have a very solid market share position in that space. Having said that, their overall market share is under 4% for the total market. So there is obviously a smaller player in the total SOC market.
 
 
Satya Kumar
Credit SuisseAnalyst
Who would be the biggest competitor you would look to gain share against and in the market that you can?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Well, I think you know the players in this space, and it is companies that have analog versions of their platforms. You know who those players are and companies that are expanding into sort of the low end of the mixed signal markets. So those would be the competitors in that space. There is a lot of turmoil in that space at this point, and the hope here is that when customers look for a reliable source of supply long term and a proven platform, that they would adopt the ETS product with us behind it, or obviously we're pushing with the FLEX product for higher SOC applications.
 
 
Satya Kumar
Credit SuisseAnalyst
You mentioned you're going to keep the products and the R&D spending intact. Is there an opportunity that you will be talking about or willing to talk about now on the SG&A side with the rate of SG&A for the synergies?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
There certainly would be SG&A synergies similar to what we receive with Nextest, public company infrastructure costs, whether that is audit fees, [DNO] insurance premiums, we look to get some savings in the manufacturing sourcing as we also did with next test, we're able to with our [SLN] group which is very skilled at getting favorable deals, we're able to get better pricing immediately. So there is a set of opportunities to get synergies. We've got a whole bunch of estimates and action plans to pursue there, so we're confident that we will realize those. We're just not although a point now where we want to disclose the precise number. And keep in mind also they are on different systems by in large, so there there wouldn't be any significant G&A savings other than the public company infrastructure costs.
 
 
Satya Kumar
Credit SuisseAnalyst
One model question. How should we model tax rates for the kind entity?

Our tax rate will go up a little bit. In the past we said 28% to 30%. We're probably now going to be 30% to 31%.

Your next question comes from [Gary Sway].
 
 
Gary Sway
Analyst
Hi. With only a 10% premium over the close prior to this announcement, just wanted to get a better understanding how this deal came together. Did Eagle Test specifically have a process to kind of source competitive bids if there were any out there?
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
We really can't get into that level of disclosure. And if you looked at the premium on a 30-day average, you'd get a different calculation. You have to be a little mindful how you look at the premium calculation.
 
 
Gary Sway
Analyst
Okay. And just back to Mike's kind of overview, what specifically is the overlap? Is it overlap specifically on the mixed signal FLEX product or is there a deeper overlap?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Gary, the overlap you see really is that customers sometimes are looking for very focused platform that is analog  for the analog dominant applications, and they may have some mixed signal, higher level of analog digital integration. And when they're looking there, they have to make a choice whether they carve out a piece of production for the focused [DTS] platform or move a mix of products on the FLEX line. That's where as we look at it in the overlapping in the competitive sense, that's where we see ourselves competing. In truth, customers are very clear when they're putting these products into production and they have side by side the ETS platform and the FLEX platform side by side, so they are able very efficiently to apply the platforms to the best price performance point, so we do see a little bit in the process of that getting sorted out by customers. but when it comes to equipment and production, that overlap evaporates.
 
 
Gary Sway

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Judy Delgado.
 
 
Judy Delgado
Analyst
Yes. Good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the mention in the press release about the Company's hoping no material adverse change happens with respect to Eagle Test. So I was curious to know if Teradyne had put in place some kind of cap on liability should the next earnings coming up in late November turn out to be a little less than expected.
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
I think what was in the press release is standard language to protect Teradyne shareholders if in the event there was a material adverse change, and that generally went run to a slight dip in the market if that is what possibly could occur, it would have to be something specific to Eagle Test that was both material and adverse, so it is a relatively I will say high hurdle. It is not something that generally  you wouldn't expect that to occur.
 
 
Judy Delgado
Analyst
Okay. Is there a cap on any liability for Teradyne?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
There is no cap on liability. I am not sure how liability would arise for Teradyne, so 
 
Judy Delgado
Analyst
Okay. With regards, I guess, I am getting more to the termination fee available?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
 termination fee, and the termination fee would come to Teradyne in the event that another bidder came along and outbid us, and then Teradyne would receive $11.5 million.
 
 
Judy Delgado
Analyst
I see
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
So that's protection for Teradyne given all the energy and effort we put into this.
 
 
Judy Delgado
Analyst
Okay. Also, I notice the Foxman family owns quite a bit of stock. Have they signed lockups in favor?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
Yes, they have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.
 
 
Judy Delgado

Your next question is from the line of [Keresh Shankar].
 
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick ones. Not sure you already answered it. In terms of products and platforms I know historically in the past you guys have kind of competed with Eagle Test, at like some of the analog spaces like national and even some kinds of TI. Just wanted to find out, are there going to be any scaling back either on the microFLEX J-750 side or one of the ETS platform that Eagle has going forward? And also you guys are competing on the automotive side of the business, so is there going to be any scaling back? That's my first question.
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
No. No. The product road maps that we have around the FLEX and for the ETS products we're going to keep intact. In short order here we'll be assuring both of our customers independently of that. As we started the conversations with Eagle, the obvious thing we asked ourselves was can we assure customers that they're going to have a sustained source of supply and that we won't be wrenching the product because of changes in product rationalization and changes in the road map, and essentially we've got an agreement that we're going to have a continuation of the R&D plan that's in place for both sides.
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Okay. And just following up on that, I do know Eagle Test in calendar maybe like the last couple of quarters or fiscal 08, they kind of increase R&D spending and part of that was employing going to go towards the lower end and higher end of mixed signal business. And roughly almost by $1 million or so on a quarterly run rate to R&D. And you're telling me you're going to be maintaining R&D. So is there any reason why you can  anything you can scale back on Eagle's R&D that the core part of Eagle business still has the products if place and then your mixed signal business can be support by the Teradyne range of products?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
I think the more nearer end point you made that spending will be winding itself down quickly, and we were commenting more on 2009, not spending. We weren't commenting on the exact spending this quarter or into the fourth quarter, but 2009 we would expect their programs that they have and the programs we have we would not be looking for synergies from either.
 
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Okay. And what about on the manufacturing side? I know Eagle does a whole bunch of lean with some of their outsourced guys, but most of them are in Illinois. Is there any plan to integrate that longer term into the Teradyne supply chain or stand alone going forward for a while?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
It will be stand alone for a while, and we will need to work carefully with Eagle Test to see what would be the best opportunities for customers alike, and we haven't gotten at any level of that planning. What we would normally do, though, is look to see if we can help with sourcing some of some of the commodities and get immediate savings, but there is a set of other things they might be able to help with in manufacturing, and we would be happy to help, but we need to figure out what makes sense financially and at what pace, and we haven't done that work yet.
 
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Okay. And one last question is, in terms of the $15.65 share price, what is the valuation metric did you looked at? Can you just explain that if you don't mind?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
We did a discounted cash flow analysis looking at Eagle Test's plan. We read the plan and made a few adjustments, very small adjustments, went out future years and applied an industry growth rate, and then we discounted it back at our weighted average cost to capital, and that amount and also looked at what the synergies could be and what that would be worth to us. That got us to about the price we ended up at, and there is a bunch of other valuations measurements applied, but basically discounting cash flow with our weighted average cost of capital is how we came up with the math that made sense for us.
 
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Okay. Last question. Looking into calendar 09, once Eagle is fully integrated into Teradyne, from a synergy standpoint, is it going to come mostly from the OpEx line, assuming the R&D and going to scale down and your distribution force can be used? So is it going to be more R&D  or OpEx going forward in 09 versus the actual COGs line?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
Correct. The single largest place probably will be SG&A.
 
 
Keresh Shankar
Analyst
Okay
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
Keep in mind that I said earlier that we don't need synergies for the deal to be attractively accretive, but we are going to get synergies that make sense.

Your next question comes from Patrick Ho.
 
 
Patrick Ho
Stifel NicolausAnalyst
Thanks a lot. I think you mentioned on the call that there is an $11.5 million break-up fee to Teradyne. Is that the same thing the other way around should you back out of the deal?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
There is no fee. We are obligated to close. We don't have the like provision in the contract.
 
 
Patrick Ho
Stifel NicolausAnalyst
Okay. Great. Mike, maybe for you on this side on technology side, just from first glance obviously looks like there is a lot of complementary technologies on their mixed signal in conjunction with your technology. Could you give just like I guess a high level overview of what technology aspects you'll be getting most, because you are doing mixed signal yourself right now? What are they going to be adding on the technology side to your products going forward?
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Well, I think the thing they brought to the table both the customers and what was attractive to us is the basic center point of the cost of the platform. They're able to have a price performance point that he that stretches down below what our FLEX and micro FLEX, where they're positioned, and obviously because those products we have are more expandable upward, they have a higher center point of costs, so that is the main attractive attribute, and the element that they bring to the table. Now, having said that, they're very strong on analog instrumentation, power management, automotive applications. The black art of analog testing is a very, very strong part of their intellectual property, and remember they also are moving into the RF space, and so they have again from an instrumentation standpoint some interesting technology that is centered around more low cost applications for RF testing. So those are the things that we hope to be able to exploit and see whether that makes sense to transport any of that to our product line, but that's what's in their portfolio

Yes, sir. And your final question will come from the line of Vernon Essi.
 
 
Vernon Essi
Needham & CompanyAnalyst
My question, I was just wondering if you were going to have  disclose right now any standard noncompete with any language that you have in the contract right now with key engineers or management?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
Upon the closing of the transaction there is going to be some select people in those contracts, there is noncompete language as you'd find in other customer contracts, but nothing broad in term of the entire workforce.
 
 
Vernon Essi
Needham & CompanyAnalyst
Nothing  okay, obviously your industry has a history of reinventing itself sometimes after these acquisitions. But what would be the typical duration for something like this? Two year?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
One year is common.
 
 
Vernon Essi
Needham & CompanyAnalyst
One year. Also on the customer front you obviously did your due diligence on the combination I would imagine prior with some of the customers. Can you give us an idea what the feedback was like? And also with a particular ear towards pricing, I would tend to think over time as the industry consolidates you're going to get to some extent  obviously everybody wants a better price, but the pricing environment has to improve I would think under a consolidation environment. Can you give us some color on that?
 
 
Greg Beecher
Teradyne, Inc.CFO
I don't think we're prepared to comment at that  at this early stage. This competitors that are in the low end market as well, so Eagle Test is not down there by themselves
 
 
Mike Bradley
Teradyne, Inc.President, CEO
Yes. I don't think this changes the equation on the competitive pricing front. There are ample alternatives that still exist in each of these segments, so this is not something that gives us an inordinate amount of leverage in that space. We're more attracted to the value that the Eagle platform provided, and we think the differentiation was what gives pricing power and what's allowed them to have the financial model that they have.
 
 
Vernon Essi
Needham & CompanyAnalyst
Okay. Thank you

Exhibit 99.1
 
Teradyne Announces Third Quarter, 2008 Results
NORTH READING, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE) Oct. 22, 2008
Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $297 million in the third quarter of 2008. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $15.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, and the loss from continuing operations was $23.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Bookings for the third quarter were $198 million.
"The current economic unrest has rippled very quickly through the semiconductor sector, and is now affecting System-On-a-Chip test buying," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "While Integrated Device Manufacturers' capital spending held up through the third quarter, our Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test customers had a strong pull-back in capacity additions. We're not expecting any short-term rebound, so our fourth quarter guidance has been adjusted accordingly. In addition we're scaling back our spending in anticipation of this uncertain environment. Our priorities remain focused on customer support, new product development and continued improvement in our over-the-cycle financial performance."
Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding the impact of the pending Eagle Test Systems acquisition, is for sales of $190 million to $220 million, with a loss per share between $0.07 and $0.18 on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP guidance excludes restructuring and other charges, net, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization.
Webcast
A webcast to discuss third quarter 2008 results and management's business outlook will be held at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, October 23. Interested investors should access the webcast at and click on "Investors" at least five minutes before the call begins. The webcast replay will be available on .

Non-GAAP Results and Guidance
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. Teradyne's earnings per share guidance is only provided on a non-GAAP basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure for restructuring and other charges, net, as well as intangible asset amortization expense.

Credit Agreement and Related Agreements
On November 14, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test") described below in Item 2.01, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among Teradyne, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), RBS Citizens, N.A., as Syndication Agent, KeyBank National Association, as Documentation Agent, Silicon Valley Bank and Toronto Dominion (New York) LLC (the "Lenders") and certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of Teradyne from time to time (the "Guarantors"). The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of $122.5 million. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand, will be used to finance the acquisition of Eagle Test, and for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. On November 14, 2008, Teradyne borrowed $100 million available under the credit facility.
At Teradyne's option, loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which will vary between 3.00% and 3.50% based on Teradyne's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which will vary between 2.00% and 2.50% based on Teradyne's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. In addition, Teradyne is required to pay the Lenders a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.75% on the actual daily unused amount of the credit facility commitments of such Lenders during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears.
The credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until November 14, 2011. Teradyne may optionally prepay loans or reduce the credit facility commitments at any time, without penalty. The revolving credit facility terminates if at any time the credit facility commitments have been permanently reduced to zero and all outstanding obligations have been repaid.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Affirmative covenants include, among others, with respect to Teradyne and its subsidiaries, maintenance of existence, financial and other reporting, payment of obligations, maintenance of properties and insurance, and an agreement to cause future material domestic subsidiaries to become parties to the Security and Pledge Agreement referred to below. Negative covenants include, among others, with respect to Teradyne and its subsidiaries, limitations on incurrence or guarantees of indebtedness, limitations on liens, sale and lease-back transactions, investments, dividends, share redemptions and other restricted payments, affiliate transactions and capital expenditures. The Credit Agreement also requires Teradyne to maintain certain financial ratios as of the end of any fiscal quarter, including a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, among others, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants, cross-defaults with other material indebtedness, certain undischarged judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA or insolvency events and the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may declare the loans and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. A bankruptcy or insolvency event of default causes such obligations automatically to become immediately due and payable.
The obligations of Teradyne under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of Teradyne. As of the closing date, the only Guarantor is Nextest Systems Corporation. Pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement, dated November 14, 2008 (the "Security and Pledge Agreement"), among Teradyne, the Guarantors and the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the loans and the other obligations of Teradyne and the Guarantors are secured by (i) all personal property of Teradyne and each Guarantor, (ii) all present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interests in) each of Teradyne's present and future subsidiaries (limited to 65% of the capital stock of each first-tier foreign subsidiary) and (iii) all real property of Teradyne and each Guarantor, if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.5 to 10.
The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement and the Security and Pledge Agreement do not purport to be complete statements of the parties' rights under such agreements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement and the Security and Pledge Agreement, respectively.
 
On November 14, 2008, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") completed its acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 1, 2008, among Teradyne, Eagle Test and Turin Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne ("Merger Sub"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Eagle Test, with Eagle Test continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Eagle Test common stock converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $15.65 per share in cash, without interest, on November 14, 2008.
The aggregate purchase price paid by Teradyne for this acquisition was approximately $250 million, net of cash acquired and including the estimated fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and estimated transaction costs.

that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States,
(A) any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
(B) each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(V) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
(f) . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.

This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans or, if such notice relates to the unlawfulness or asserted unlawfulness of charging interest based on the Eurodollar Rate, to make Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
 
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender and Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate to Base Rate Loans as to which the rate of interest is not determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loan.

The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any holder of Secured Obligations may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Obligors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by Law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Administrative Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor the holders of the Secured Obligations shall have any liability or responsibility to any Obligor for acceptance of a check, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend "payment in full" or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance. Furthermore, the Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may communicate with account debtors on the Accounts to verify with them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Accounts.
Remedies relating to Accounts

(ii) The Administrative Agent may release any of the Pledged Equity from this Agreement or may substitute any of the Pledged Equity for other Pledged Equity without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Agreement as to any Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted, and this Agreement shall continue as a first priority lien on all Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted.

Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria

Salary Continuation

In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment , benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available

(e) Employee agrees that during the Salary Continuation Period, he/she will make reasonable good faith efforts to give verbal notice to Teradyne of each new business activity he/she plans to undertake, at least (5) business days prior to beginning any such activity.
(f) If Employee violates the provisions of this Section 3, Teradyne shall be entitled to suspend and recoup any salary continuation payment made per Section 1 (d) above and Employee shall continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 for an additional period of time equal to the duration of the violation, such additional period not to exceed 24 months.
 
3A. . Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be "at will" and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on October 19, 2001 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.

Counterparts
 
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).

Exhibit 99.2
AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available
Release
 
unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

(c) Employee acknowledges that the restriction contained in this Section 3 is necessary for the protection of the business and good will of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose.

Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be "at will" and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on January 31, 2003 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.

Counterparts
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses
14. . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.

Exhibit 99.3
AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payments shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e) .
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless
Release
 
Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

(c) Employee acknowledges tat the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose.

No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on January 9, 2004 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement

Notices

Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).

Exhibit 99.4
AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30

day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e) .
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available

Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on July 2, 2003 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement

Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).

AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to benefits to be afforded to Employee upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award, payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of each calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
 
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment , benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(d) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits [or removal of restrictions] under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments , [or removal of restrictions] shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control.

6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes
Assignment
 
effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on October 19, 2001 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect and provided further that the Agreement Regarding Termination Benefits entered into contemporaneously herewith between Teradyne and the Employee shall not be modified by this Agreement but shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its own terms. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement

Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses
14. . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.

All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and savings plan plus, profit sharing payments and participation in the employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the Date of Termination.
Benefits:
 
To the extent that amounts paid by the Company to provide benefits under this paragraph (c), are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and to the extent any such benefits are reimbursements of expenses incurred by the Executive then the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year may not effect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in another taxable year; such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; and the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

Equity Awards:

Taxes and Withholdings:

4.2 Notwithstanding the preceding Section 4.1 and in consideration of, and as condition to, the Executive providing to the Company the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 4.3 below, the Company agrees that if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for Disability, the Company shall, unless otherwise required under Section 4.1(b) above:
(a) provide the monthly payments described in Section 4.1(a) above, as reduced pursuant to 4.2(b) below, to the Executive for each month during the two (2) year period following his termination during which the Executive does not receive or is no longer eligible to receive any Company disability insurance benefits under the applicable insurance policy or program(s), other than as a result of Executive's intentional malfeasance or death; and
 
(b) under this Section 4.2, reduce each monthly payment described in Section 4.1(a) above to the Executive by any compensation received by the Executive from other employment, consulting or the rendition of services outside the Restricted Activities.
The Executive agrees to use his best efforts to obtain and maintain any benefits from any disability policy or program under which he is an insured party or participant.

Executive's Covenants:
(a) that during the Term of this Agreement and for two (2) years after the Executive's Date of Termination resulting from a termination by the Company for any reason other than for Death or Disability and so long as such termination does not trigger or entitle the Executive to any payments or benefits under the Change in Control Agreement, the Executive will not directly or indirectly engage in any of the Restricted Activities.

On January 28, 2009, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") issued a press release regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Teradyne's press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On January 28, 2009, Teradyne announced actions it has or will be taking as part of the Company's ongoing efforts to lower expenses and the cost structure in light of the industry wide continued decline in orders for semiconductor production equipment. The actions include:
 
 
In addition to these actions, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors ("Board") of Teradyne approved on January 26-27, 2009, a further temporary reduction in the annual base salaries of its executive officers including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) commencing February 1, 2009.

On January 27, 2009, the Board also approved a further temporary reduction in the annual cash retainers for non-employee directors effective April 1, 2009. These reductions are in addition to earlier reductions which were implemented on January 1, 2009.
When compared to the 2008 executive officer annual base salaries, the effect of the two reductions is that the annual base salary of the CEO and President of Teradyne has been decreased by 15% from its 2008 level and the annual base salaries of the other executive officers have been decreased by 10% from their respective 2008 levels.
When compared to the 2008 annual cash retainers for non-employees directors, the effect of the two reductions is that the annual cash retainer for all non-employee directors, including the Chair, has been decreased by 15% from its 2008 level.
The reduced annual base salaries and annual cash retainer amounts are set forth in Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K. These reductions shall remain in place until otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee and/or Board of Directors, as appropriate.
 
(e) Executive Compensation  Form of Agreement for Stock Option Awards
In connection with the grant of non-statutory stock options to executive officers under the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan ("2006 Plan"), the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of Teradyne approved on January 26-27, 2009, the agreement form for non-statutory stock option grants for executive officers, including the CEO ("Executive Officer Stock Option Grant Agreement") pursuant to which stock option awards will be granted to the executive officers, including the CEO under the 2006 Plan.
Under the terms of the Executive Officer Stock Option Grant Agreement, stock option awards to executive officers, including the CEO, will vest over a four year period, with 25% of the total award vesting on the first and each of the three subsequent anniversaries of the grant date. The executive officers receiving stock option awards will not have any right in, to or with respect to any shares which may be issuable under the award until the issuance of shares upon exercise of the option.
The above description of the Executive Officer Stock Option Grant Agreement is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the Executive Officer Stock Option Grant Agreement and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the form of the Executive Officer Stock Option Grant Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit Index
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NORTH READING, Mass.(BUSINESS WIRE)Teradyne, Inc (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $195 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, the company's loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $32.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. These results include $2.5 million of sales and $0.03 loss per diluted share as a result of the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. (Eagle Test), which was completed on November 14, 2008. The preliminary GAAP loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $55.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.
Bookings for the fourth quarter were $169 million, and included a full quarter of Eagle Test bookings of $8 million.
For fiscal year 2008, sales were $1.1 billion. Income from continuing operations for the year was $32.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. The preliminary GAAP loss from continuing operations was $65.3 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. Bookings for the year were $996 million.
Guidance for the first quarter of 2009 is for sales of $125 million to $145 million, with a loss per share between $0.38 and $0.31 on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP guidance excludes special items, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization.
Teradyne also announced that in the first quarter it will be reducing its worldwide staff by about 14% and implementing a 10% broad-based temporary pay cut. These actions, along with other cost reductions, will reduce the company's expenses by approximately $140 million on an annualized basis.
"In 2008, we brought a record number of new products to market, gained market share for the third year in a row and significantly reduced our operating costs," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "But worldwide economic conditions require that we reduce our fixed costs even further. We remain focused on our new product development and customer support priorities as we navigate through these very challenging times.
"Strategically, our market coverage has never been greater," Bradley added. "We remain on schedule to compete in the High-Speed Memory (HSM) test market in 2009 with a highly differentiated offering in next-generation DRAM products. We entered FLASH memory with our Nextest Systems acquisition in early 2008, and their new Magnum II product met its customer penetration and share gain targets with new applications in MultiChip Package testing. Our most recent acquisition Eagle Test, while facing tough market headwinds, provides us with a very strong analog System-On-a-Chip (SOC) platform. Couple this with
our distribution and support muscle in Asia, and we're well positioned to accelerate Eagle Test's growth. In summary, our market expansion plans are on schedule, costs are being lowered significantly and we expect to continue our multi-year track record of gaining share in our core businesses."
Potential Goodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment
Due to the deteriorating macro-economic environment and the decline in the price of the Teradyne's common stock, Teradyne is performing a goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analysis as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment of or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" and No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Teradyne currently anticipates having the analysis completed in mid to late February. It is probable that Teradyne's goodwill or long-lived assets will be determined to be impaired in whole or in part and that a non-cash charge will be required, which could be material and would increase our reported preliminary GAAP net loss and loss per share for the fourth quarter and for 2008. The non-cash charge would not impact the non-GAAP financial results presented in this press release.
Webcast
A webcast to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results, along with management's business outlook will be held at 10 a.m. EST, Thursday, January 29, 2009. Interested investors should access the webcast at and click on "Investors" at least five minutes before the call begins. The webcast replay will be available on .

Non-GAAP Results and Guidance
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures
its own business. Teradyne's earnings per share guidance for the first quarter of 2009 is only provided on a non-GAAP basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable GAAP measure for all restructuring and other charges, net, as well as intangible asset amortization expense. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges in the first quarter, including approximately $25 million of estimated severance charges, other additional restructuring charges and intangible asset amortization expense are dependent on unknown factors and future events which make it difficult to forecast and quantify such amounts. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication. Teradyne disclaims any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this press release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding future business prospects and market conditions. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results or other forward looking statements will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those presently expected include: conditions affecting the markets in which Teradyne operates including uncertainties related to the global economy in general; continued volatility and further deterioration in the financial markets, including uncertainties and disruptions in credit markets and the availability of credit; decreased product demand; delays in new product introductions; lack of customer acceptance of new products; the ability to realize synergies and cost savings from the integration of Eagle Test Systems with Teradyne's existing operations; difficulties by management in successfully implementing the cost reduction plans; unanticipated delays in or costs and expenses relating to the implementation of the cost reduction plans; the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, the "Risk Factors" section of Teradyne's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP (loss)/income and non-GAAP (loss)/income per share refer to (loss)/income from continuing operations or (loss)/income per common share from continuing operations excluding in-process research and development, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provision reversals and fair value inventory step-up related to Nextest and Eagle Test, certain interest and other, net, and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as applicable adjustments to profit sharing and income taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining (loss)/income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP (loss)/income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP (loss)/income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Employment or another business relationship shall be considered as continuing uninterrupted during any bona fide leave of absence (such as those attributable to illness or military obligations) provided that the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days or, in the case of an employee, if longer, any period during which the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute. A bona fide leave of absence with the written approval of the Committee shall not be considered an interruption of employment or other business relationship, provided that such written approval contractually obligates the Company to continue the employment or other business relationship of the recipient after the approved period of absence.
(a) Options are exercised by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of shares as to which Option is being exercised and paying the Company the full option price for such shares. Payment can be made to the Company by a combination of cash, certified or bank check, or personal check (in each case in United States dollars), or by delivery of shares of Teradyne common stock that were not acquired in the 6 months prior to exercise of the option or through the delivery of an assignment to the Company of a sufficient amount of the proceeds from the sale of the common stock acquired upon exercise of the Option and authorization to the third party commercial provider to pay that amount to the Company, provided the such process is consistent with and permissible under applicable law.
(b) You shall not have any right in, to or with respect to the shares which may be issuable under this award upon exercise (including but not limited to the right to vote or to receive dividends) until the issuance of shares to you upon exercise of the option. All shares issuable upon exercise of this option will be transferred or issued to you (or your estate, in the event of your death) promptly upon exercise but in any event within 2

/
2
months following the calendar year in which they are exercised, or any earlier date required to avoid characterization as non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code).
(c) With regard to any option exercises, the Company will not be required to transfer or issue any shares until arrangements satisfactory to it have been made to address any income, withholding and employment tax requirements which might arise by reason of the option exercise. The Company will pay any transfer or issue tax and deliver a certificate for the shares purchased.
 
This stock option award may not be assigned or transferred other than as provided in Section 11(a) of the Plan.
 
Section 3(c) of the Plan contains provisions for adjusting (or substituting) the number, vesting schedule, exercise, price and other terms of outstanding stock-based Awards granted under the Plan if a recapitalization, stock split, merger, or other specified event occurs, and the Committee determines that an adjustment (or substitution) is appropriate.
 
Granting this award does not imply any right of continued employment or business relationship by the Company, and does not affect the right of the recipient or the Company to terminate employment or a business relationship at any time.
 
Shares to be issued upon exercise of this option are currently registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If such registration is not in effect at the time of exercise, the recipient will be required to represent to the Company that he or she is acquiring such shares as an investment and not with a view to the sale of those shares.
 
This Stock Option Award is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts exclusive of reference of rules and principles of conflicts of law. This Stock Option Award and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Company regarding this option.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1The Company
Nextest Systems Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in California in November 1997 and reincorporated in Delaware in March 2006. The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, sale and service of automatic test equipment ("ATE") for the semiconductor industry.
The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in June. Fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 are 52 and 53 week fiscal years, respectively. The periods for the three and six months ended December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 included 13 and 26 weeks, respectively.
Note 2Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The June 30, 2007 consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary, including adjustments resulting from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Financial Interpretation 48, "Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties" ("FIN 48") as discussed in "Note 11Income Taxes", for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including inventory valuation, accounts receivable valuation, accrued warranty, income taxes and estimated fair values of stock options) and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Note 3Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued FIN 48. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority. FIN 48 provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods
 
and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Position FIN No. 48-1, Definition of "Settlement" in FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FSP FIN No. 48-1"). FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how a company should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on July 1, 2007, the first day of its 2008 fiscal year. The effect of the adoption of FIN 48 on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet is summarized in "Note 11Income Taxes".
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company as of July 1, 2008.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141(R) establishes new principles and requirements for how an acquiring company 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141 (R) is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," ("SFAS No. 159"), including an amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS No. 115"). SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 161), an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entity's financial position, performance and cash flow. SFAS No. 161 is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after November 15, 2008.
In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No.142-3 (FSP No. 142-3), "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets". This FSP amends the guidance in FASB Statement No. 142 ,"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", about estimating useful lives of recognized intangible assets and requires additional disclosures related to renewing or extending the terms of a recognized intangible asset. In estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset, the FSP requires companies to consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements together with the asset's intended use, regardless of whether the arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions. The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date.
Note 4Short-term Investments
The Company classifies marketable securities with remaining maturities at the time of purchase of greater than 90 days as short-term investments as these investments are deemed to be available for use in current operations as needed. Marketable securities consist of municipal debt and auction-rate securities that are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" with net unrealized gains and losses reported within stockholders' equity. Such unrealized gains and losses at December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 were immaterial. Realized gains or losses on the sale or maturity of securities are determined based on specific identification and are included in interest and other income, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As of December 29, 2007, short-term investments consisted of auction rate and municipal debt securities which when purchased had contractual maturity dates of greater than 90 days.
 
Note 5Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with high-quality financial institutions. Deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company's accounts receivable are derived from U.S. dollar denominated revenue earned from customers located primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition. While the Company generally does not require collateral, in certain circumstances it may require a customer to provide an irrevocable letter of credit and/or a significant cash deposit prior to shipment. The Company assesses collectibility of its accounts receivable and provides a valuation allowance for its estimate of uncollectible amounts. The Company did not have significant provisions, write-offs or recoveries during the three months and six months ended December 29, 2007 or the three and six months ended December 23, 2006.
The following table sets forth sales to customers comprising 10% or more of the Company's net revenue for the periods indicated:
 
* Less than 10% of net revenue in the period.
The following table sets forth accounts receivable from customers comprising 10% or more of the Company's total accounts receivable balance at the period ends indicated:
 
* Less than 10% of total accounts receivable balance at period end.
Note 6Balance Sheet Components
 
 
Inventory provisions for the three months ended December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 were $1,617,000 and $215,000, respectively. The benefits resulting from sales of previously written-down inventory for the three months ended December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 were $403,000 and $315,000, respectively. Inventory provisions for the six months ended December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 were $2,066,000 and $459,000, respectively. The benefits resulting from sales of previously written-down inventory for the six months ended December 29, 2007 and December 23, 2006 were $648,000 and $354,000, respectively.
Note 7Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock, including stock options, restricted stock units and unvested restricted common shares subject to repurchase using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the Company included the impact of assumed windfall tax benefits as part of the proceeds calculation related to options outstanding prior to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123 (R)").
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
The following outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as they would have had an antidilutive effect (in thousands):
 
Note 8Stock-based Compensation
During the six months ended December 29, 2007, the Company granted stock options and restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. The total number of stock options granted was 20,000 at the weighted average grant date fair value of $8.05. The total number of restricted stock units granted was 23,500 at the weighted average grant date fair value of $12.50.
Note 9Segment and Geographic Information
The Company operates in one segment: designing, manufacturing and marketing of automated test equipment for the semiconductor industry.
The Company markets its products and related services to customers mainly through a direct sales force. Net revenue is attributed to geographic areas based on the country to which product is shipped or its first "in-use" country, if known. The Company's net revenue by geographic regions was (in thousands):
 
Over 90% of the Company's long-lived assets are located in the United States.
Note 10Commitments and Contingencies
Warranty
The Company generally warrants its products against defects, in material, workmanship and non-conformance to the Company's specification for a period of twelve months. The Company's warranty provision is based on the Company's best estimate, considering historical experiences with similar products as well as other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. A provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded as a cost of revenue and is included in accrued liabilities when the related
 
revenue is recognized. Adjustments are made to such estimates based on actual settlements. Changes in the Company's warranty provision were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Contingencies
The Company, as permitted under Delaware law and in accordance with its By-laws, has indemnification obligations to its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they were serving at the Company's request in such capacity. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, there have been no claims to date, and the Company has a Director and Officer insurance policy that enables the directors and officers to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.
The Company's sales agreements indemnify its customers for any expenses or liability resulting from claimed infringements of patents, trademarks or copyrights of third parties. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited. However, to date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to any claim.
From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there are no pending claims of which the outcome is expected to result in a material adverse effect in the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
Line of Credit
Since April 29, 2005, the Company has maintained a $10,000,000 maximum revolving credit facility based on certain qualifying accounts receivable with a financial institution that expires on July 28, 2008, bearing interest at the bank's prime rate per annum. The agreement, which is collateralized by the assets of the Company, contains a minimum net worth covenant and other restrictions. As of December 29, 2007, there have been no borrowings under the line of credit and the Company was in compliance with the covenant and other restrictions.
Lease Obligation
There were no significant changes to the Company's operating lease obligations during the three and six months ended December 29, 2007.
 
In October 2007, the Company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters from 1901 Monterey Road, San Jose, California to 875 Embedded Way, San Jose, California. The Company constructed improvements at the building to prepare the leased premise for its intended use. Per the terms of the lease agreement, the landlord provided a tenant improvement allowance of up to $1.8 million of the construction costs. During the quarter ended September 29, 2007, the Company submitted to the landlord a claim for the total tenant improvement allowance of $1.8 million. This claim was paid on December 28, 2007. As of December 29, 2007, the Company has recorded a deferred rent balance of $1.7 million within other liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, , the deferred rent balance will be amortized as a reduction to lease expense over the term of the lease.
Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of day-to-day operations. As of December 29, 2007, the Company was not engaged in any legal proceedings that were expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Note 11Income Taxes
Effective July 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of adopting FIN 48, the Company decreased its income taxes payable by $0.2 million with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2007. The Company also reclassified $0.8 million from current to non-current income taxes payable and $0.4 million was reclassified from current taxes payable to reduce long-term deferred tax assets.
On July 1, 2007, the Company had $1.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately $0.7 million, net of federal benefits, would be recorded as an income tax benefit on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income. During the six months ended December 29, 2007, the Company recorded an increase of its unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million. The Company anticipates that its total unrecognized tax benefits may change by $0.3 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitations during the next 12 months.
After the adoption of FIN 48, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of the income tax provision. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, interest and penalties related to income taxes were included in interest and other income, net on the Company's consolidated income statement. Prior period financial statements were not restated to reflect the change in accounting policy. As of July 1, 2007, the Company had $0.1 million accrued for interest. As of December 29, 2007, the Company had $0.2 million accrued for interest. These accruals are included as components of non-current income taxes payable on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be subject to the examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service for years 2001 and forward. For the Company's significant state tax jurisdictions, the Company is subject to routine examination for years 2001 and forward. In addition, any research and development credit carryforwards that were generated in prior years and utilized in these years may also be subject to examination by respective state taxing authorities. Generally, the Company is subject to routine examination for years 2005 and forward in various immaterial foreign tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
 
Note 12Subsequent Event
On January 24, 2008, Teradyne, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company's stockholders received $20.00 per share in cash. In addition, the Company's outstanding stock options and restricted stock units were assumed by Teradyne, Inc. and were converted into stock options to purchase, and restricted stock units representing, Teradyne, Inc. common stock.
 

Exhibit 99.2
On November 14, 2008, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") completed its acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test"). Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Eagle Test, at a price of $15.65 per share in cash. On January 24, 2008, Teradyne completed its acquisition of Nextest Systems Corporation ("Nextest"). Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Nextest, at a price of $20.00 per share in cash. For the purpose of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the acquisitions are assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2007 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and as of September 28, 2008, for the Eagle Test acquisition, with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
Teradyne, Eagle Test and Nextest have different fiscal year ends, which end on December 31, September 30 and the last Saturday in June, respectively. As a result, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been derived from:
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 has been derived from:
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 28, 2008 has been derived from:
 
 
Because these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the Eagle Test acquisition, the actual amounts recorded for the Eagle Test acquisition may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's preliminary estimates of fair value, with the excess purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired being allocated to goodwill. Definitive allocations will be performed and finalized. Teradyne expects to finalize the purchase price allocation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the purchase allocation pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transactions. The nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transactions include in-process research and development, fair value of acquired inventory and investment advisory and legal costs.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Teradyne that would have been reported had the acquisitions and cash payments been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future results of operations or financial position of Teradyne. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that Teradyne may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Teradyne, Eagle Test and Nextest included in their respective annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne"), Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test") and Nextest Systems Corporation ("Nextest") after giving effect to Teradyne's acquisition of Eagle Test and Nextest and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of Eagle Test on November 14, 2008. Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nextest on January 24, 2008.
For the purpose of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the acquisitions are assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2007 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and as of September 28, 2008, for the Eagle Test acquisition, with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
Teradyne, Eagle Test and Nextest have different fiscal year ends, which end on December 31, September 30 and the last Saturday in June, respectively. As a result, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been derived from:
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 has been derived from:
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 28, 2008 has been derived from:
 
 
Because these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the Eagle Test acquisition, the actual amounts recorded for the Eagle Test acquisition may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's preliminary estimates of fair value, with the excess purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired being allocated to goodwill. Definitive allocations will be performed and finalized. Teradyne expects to finalize the purchase price allocation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the purchase allocation pro forma
 
adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transactions. The nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transactions include in-process research and development, fair value of acquired inventory and investment advisory and legal costs.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Teradyne that would have been reported had the acquisitions and cash payments been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future results of operations or financial position of Teradyne. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that Teradyne may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Teradyne, Eagle Test and Nextest included in their respective annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
2. NEXTEST ACQUISITION
On January 24, 2008, Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nextest, a publicly held company based in San Jose, California. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Nextest stockholders received $20.00 per share in cash for each Nextest share. In addition, outstanding Nextest stock options and restricted stock units were assumed by Teradyne and were converted into stock options to purchase, and restricted stock units representing, Teradyne common stock.
This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting. The total purchase price of $402.4 million was comprised of (in thousands):
 
Purchase Price Allocation
The allocation of the total purchase price to Nextest's net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was based on their estimated fair values as of January 24, 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible and net tangible assets was allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of $402.4 million has been allocated as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Other intangible assets
Teradyne has estimated the fair value of other intangible assets using the income approach to value these identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at January 24, 2008 (in thousands):
 
Tangible assets and liabilities
Tangible assets were recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value, except for inventory. Teradyne increased Nextest's historical net carrying amount of certain inventory by $4.3 million to reflect its fair market value. The property and equipment, net are recorded at the historical carrying value, which we believe approximates fair value.
Liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value and the amount expected to be paid, except for deferred revenue and deferred rent. Deferred revenue and deferred rent were reduced by $7.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to reflect their fair values.
3. EAGLE TEST ACQUISITION
On November 14, 2008, Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding shares of Eagle Test, a publicly held company based in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Eagle Test stockholders received $15.65 per share in cash for each Eagle Test share. In addition, outstanding Eagle Test stock options were assumed by Teradyne and were converted into stock options to purchase Teradyne common stock.
This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting. The total purchase price of $374.4 million was comprised of (in thousands):
 
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The preliminary allocation of the total Eagle Test purchase price to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair value as of November 14, 2008. Adjustments to these estimates will be included in the final allocation of the purchase price of Eagle Test, which changes could be material. The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending the final determination of the fair value of certain assumed assets and liabilities and the completion of facility exit and restructuring plans. Teradyne expects to finalize the purchase price allocation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates. The excess of the
 
purchase price over the identifiable intangible and net tangible assets was allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of $374.4 million has been allocated as follows (in thousands):
 
Other intangible assets
Teradyne has estimated the fair value of other intangible assets using the income approach to value these identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to change, which changes could be material. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at November 14, 2008 (in thousands):
 
Tangible assets and liabilities
Tangible assets were recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value, except for inventory and property and equipment. Teradyne increased Eagle Test's historical net carrying amount of certain inventory by $14.7 million in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value.
Liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value and the amount expected to be paid, except for deferred revenue. Deferred revenue has been reduced by $3.4 million in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value of $1.0 million.
4. HISTORICAL INFORMATION
Nextest's unaudited historical financial statements for the period December 30, 2007 to January 24, 2008 and the four fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2007 are derived from Nextest's historical financial statements. Nextest's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in June; and its historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to Teradyne's December 31 fiscal year by adding the six-month period ended December 31, 2007 to its fiscal 2007 financial statements and deducting the six-month period ended December 23, 2006 therefrom.
Eagle Test's historical financial statements as of September 30, 2008, for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2008 and for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2007 are derived from Eagle Test's historical financial statements. Eagle Test's fiscal
 
year ends on September 30; and its historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to Teradyne's December 31 fiscal year end by adding the three-month period ended December 31, 2007 to its fiscal 2007 statements and deducting the three-month period ended December 31, 2006 therefrom.
5. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet:
A. To give effect to (i) receipt of $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount under revolving line of credit, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $2.8 million and (ii) cash payments of $362.8 million to acquire the shares of Eagle Test and pay estimated acquisition-related transaction costs of $5.1 million.
B. To increase the historical carrying value of Eagle Test inventories to the estimated selling prices less the cost of disposal and selling effort, including an appropriate return on sales effort.
C. To increase the historical carrying value of Eagle Test inventories to the estimated selling prices less the cost of disposal and selling effort, including an appropriate return on sales effort and to reclassify Eagle customer service inventory to property, plant and equipment; consistent with Teradyne's accounting policy.
D. To adjust deferred taxes.
E. To reclassify Eagle Test customer service inventory to property, plant and equipment, consistent with Teradyne's accounting policy.
F. To record Eagle Test preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill and intangible assets as though the Eagle Test acquisition had occurred on the balance sheet date. The pro forma adjustment for goodwill differs from the amount shown in Note 3 as the result of different tangible net asset balances as of September 28, 2008 (the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet) and November 14, 2008 (the date of the acquisition).
G. To record $2.8 million of fees and expenses related to revolving line of credit and reduce deferred taxes by $0.5 million.
H. To record preliminary acquisition-related liability of $4.2 million for estimated severance costs associated with Eagle Test employees.
I. To record fair value adjustment to Eagle Test's deferred revenue.
J. To reflect the receipt of $100.0 million under revolving line of credit to finance a portion of the Eagle Test cash purchase price.
K. To record preliminary acquisition-related liability of $1.7 million for estimated lease exit costs associated with facilities leased by Eagle Test.
L. To record the following adjustments to shareholders' equity (in thousands):
 
M. To exclude the nonrecurring selling and administrative charge of $1.4 million for investment advisory and legal costs incurred and expensed by Nextest as a direct result of the acquisition prior to the completion of the acquisition.
N. To record amortization of Nextest intangible assets acquired.
 
O. To record forgone interest income resulting from cash utilized in connection with the Nextest acquisition, based on actual cash paid for the acquisition and acquisition costs, and the historical interest rate earned on Teradyne's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
P. To record tax effects associated with the pro forma adjustments recorded in the condensed combined statements of operations.
Q. To record amortization of Eagle Test intangible assets acquired.
R. To record foregone interest income from cash used in connection with the Eagle Test acquisition based on (i) the amount to be paid for the Eagle Test shares and the related acquisition costs and (ii) net proceeds of $97.2 million from line of credit at the historical rate of interest earned on Teradyne's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
S. To reflect additional interest expense after giving effect to the receipt of $100.0 million under revolving line of credit. The adjustment assumes amortization of debt issuance costs on a straight-line basis over the line of credit's 3 year term. Interest expense is based upon an interest rate of 5.5%. Each one-eighth change in the annual interest rate would result in a $0.1 million change in annual interest expense.
T. To eliminate Nextest shares acquired as part of the Nextest acquisition. Note that an adjustment has been made to give effect to the impact of assumed Nextest stock options and restricted stock units as they would have been dilutive.
U. To eliminate Eagle Test shares acquired as part of the Eagle Test acquisition. Note that an adjustment has been made to give effect to the impact of assumed Eagle Test stock options as they would have been dilutive.
V. To exclude the nonrecurring cost of revenue charge of $4.3 million to reflect acquired Nextest inventory at fair value.
W. To exclude the nonrecurring selling and administrative charge of $5.7 million for investment advisory and legal costs incurred and expensed by Nextest as a direct result of the acquisition prior to the completion of the acquisition.
X. To exclude the nonrecurring in-process research and development charge of $1.1 million related to the Nextest acquisition.
Y. To exclude the nonrecurring selling and administrative charge of $2.0 million for investment advisory and legal costs incurred and expensed by Eagle Test as a direct result of the acquisition prior to the completion of the acquisition.
Z. No adjustment made as the impact of potentially dilutive securities would be antidilutive.
6. NONRECURRING CHARGES
The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 do not reflect the impact on cost of revenues of $4.3 million to reflect Nextest acquired inventory at fair value or the impact on operating expenses of an in-process research and development expense of $1.1 million related to Nextest. The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 do not reflect the impact on selling and administrative expenses of investment advisory and legal costs of $5.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, incurred and expensed by Nextest as a direct result of the acquisition prior to the acquisition. The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 and for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, do not reflect the impact on cost of sales of $14.7 million to reflect acquired Eagle Test inventory at fair value and on operating expenses of an in-process research and development expense of $0.5 million related to Eagle Test. The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 do not reflect the impact on selling and administrative expenses of investment advisory and legal costs of $2.0 million incurred and expensed by Eagle Test as a direct result of the acquisition prior to the acquisition. Under SEC rules and regulations relating to pro forma financial statements, these amounts are considered to be nonrecurring charges and are excluded from the pro forma statements of operations.

The Stockholders and Management
Eagle Test Systems, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing our audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. at September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. The Company
Eagle Test Systems, Inc. (the Company) designs, manufactures, sells, and services automated test equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor industry. The Company's test systems test analog, mixed-signal, and RF (radio frequency) semiconductor devices. Semiconductor designers and manufacturers worldwide use semiconductor test systems to test devices at different stages during the manufacturing process. These tested devices are incorporated into a wide range of products, including digital cameras, MP3 players, cellular telephones, video/multimedia products, automotive electronics, computer peripherals, and notebook and desktop computers. The Company is headquartered in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, where the Company develops and manufactures its test systems. The Company operates in one industry segment: the design, manufacture, and marketing of automated test equipment. The Company also maintains various offices worldwide for sales, service, and research to support its customer base directly. The operations of, and net investment in, foreign subsidiaries are not material.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company and reflect all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results can differ from those estimates.
The Company's foreign operations use local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at year-end, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are recorded in earnings within other income (expense), net.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized by the Company when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller's price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
The Company derives revenue primarily from test system sales. Revenue related to systems sales is recognized when (i) the Company has a written sales agreement; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. If installation services are part of a system sale, test system revenue is deferred until the system is delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer.
When sales to a customer involve multiple elements, revenue is recognized on the delivered element, provided that the undelivered element is a standard product with evidence of fair value, there is a history of acceptance of the product with the customer, and the undelivered element is not essential to the customer's application. When a sale of a test system includes post-contract customer support, or PCS, revenue for the PCS is recognized ratably over the PCS period. Revenue related to individual resource boards is recognized upon shipment.
In a few instances, the Company has entered into short-term rental agreements with customers for the use of its systems. The Company recognizes rental revenue ratably over the applicable rental period. Rental revenues are included as a component of product sales and have been immaterial to date.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the delivery of systems are expensed as incurred and classified as cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.
Product Warranty Costs
The Company's systems are sold with warranty provisions that require the Company to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of its products over a period ranging from 12 to 24 months. The policy of the Company is to establish warranty reserves at the time revenue is recognized at levels that represent the estimate of costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to materials, outside contractors, equipment depreciation, and other engineering overhead costs. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. Research and development tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes to the extent that they can be utilized in the tax return.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and that have remaining maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities that are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Securities available for sale include variable rate demand notes (VRDNs). Changes in fair value in marketable securities are reflected in other comprehensive income unless a decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities are determined based on average cost.
Allowance for Sales Returns and Uncollectibles
The Company determines its allowance for sales returns and uncollectibles by making its best estimate considering its historical accounts receivable collection experience, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms, and recent information that the Company has about the current status of its accounts receivable balances. If future conditions cause the Company's collections experience to change or if the Company later obtains different information about the status of any or all of its accounts receivable, additional allowances for sales returns and uncollectibles may be required.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out method, and include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Inventories at customers under purchase orders represent systems that have been shipped under the terms of a customer purchase order, but have not yet qualified for revenue recognition as the systems have not been accepted as of the balance sheet date.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Equipment includes internally manufactured systems used for testing components and engineering and applications development equipment. Repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.
The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There have been no impairments of long-lived assets in the years ended 2008, 2007, or 2006.
Stock Options
The Company records compensation expense using the fair value of options granted over the vesting period on a straight-line basis, including those options that are subject to graded vesting. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the options granted. This model uses such factors as the market price of the underlying shares at date of issuance; exercise price of the option; the expected term of the option, which is approximately six years, utilizing the simplified method as set forth in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107; a risk-free interest rate range of approximately 2.1% to 4.9%; and an expected volatility rate range of
 
Table of Contents
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
approximately 54% to 67% based upon a peer group of companies, given limited historical data for the Company's own stock. On December 21, 2007, SAB No. 110 was issued which extended the use of the simplified method, which was set to expire on December 31, 2007, in certain situations when sufficient option exercise history does not exist. The Company continues to use the simplified method, due to the lack of sufficient option exercise history. The fair value of $2,705 for options granted in fiscal 2008 will be amortized to expense as vesting occurs, which is over approximately five years. Expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was $1,353 ($1,215 net of taxes), $602 ($510 net of taxes), and $354 ($312 net of taxes), respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, the carrying costs of certain of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities (other than auction rate securities), accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to their short maturities or other factors. Refer to Note 3 for discussion on fair value of auction rate securities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Effective October 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The adoption did not have an effect on the results of operations or financial condition. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of October 1, 2007 or September 30, 2008. If interest and penalties would need to be accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, such amounts would be recognized as a component of income tax expense; while prior to adoption of FIN 48, the interest and penalties were recognized as components of interest expense and selling, general, and administrative expense, respectively.

Table of Contents
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors' requests for more information about (1) the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, (2) the information used to measure fair value, and (3) the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings. SFAS No. 157 will apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances. The Company will adopt this requirement for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-1, and FSP No. FAS 157-2, . Collectively, these FSPs allow a one-year deferral of adoption of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis and amend SFAS No. 157 to exclude FASB Statement No. 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will materially impact its consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements
Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard's objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. The Company will adopt this requirement for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
 
Table of Contents
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), , a replacement of FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and applies to all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) provides that, upon initially obtaining control, an acquirer shall recognize 100% of the fair values of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities, with only limited exceptions, even if the acquirer has not acquired 100% of its target. As a consequence, the current step acquisition model will be eliminated. While the adoption of this standard is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to the implementation date.
Business Combinations
3. Marketable Securities and Long-Term Investments
At September 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company's marketable securities were invested in VRDNs. The Company has an option to put the VRDNs back to the financial institution remarketing agent that provides for liquidity within two to five days, and these instruments trade at par value. Since the put option is not with the original issuer, the VRDNs are classified as marketable securities available for sale. Of the VRDNs held by the Company as of September 30, 2008, $13,600 had contractual maturities of 5 to 10 years, and $25,810 had contractual maturities over 10 years.
The Company's long-term investments were comprised of auction rate securities (ARSs). As of September 30, 2008, the Company had $29,950 (at par) of ARSs, which are variable rate securities, all of which are AA/AAA rated and collateralized by student loans ($24,850 at par) and municipal revenues ($5,100 at par). The student loan ARSs are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third-party insurer. The ARSs are typically bought and sold in a Dutch auction process that resets the interest rate through buyers and sellers stipulating the reset interest rate for the par value of the securities. While the underlying securities for the ARSs have a long-term nominal maturity, the interest rate is reset through a Dutch auction process at predetermined intervals of 7 to 35 days.
 
Table of Contents
3. Marketable Securities and Long-Term Investments (continued)
 
Starting mid-February 2008, the Company experienced difficulties in selling the ARSs due to the failure of auctions. These failed auctions represent market liquidity risk and not defaults or credit events. The Company continues to receive interest on the investment, currently at a predetermined maximum rate based on a spread above named market rate indices or a penalty interest rate stipulated in the bond indenture. In the absence of observable market data, the Company obtained a third party valuation analysis which considered factors such as type of security, tax status, credit quality, expected holding periods, portfolio composition, and credit and liquidity premiums. Based upon this valuation, the Company determined the fair value of the ARSs to be $27,535, resulting in an unrealized loss of $2,415 ($1,466 net of tax) as of September 30, 2008.
Pursuant to SFAS No. 115, , as well as other related accounting guidance, the Company considered whether the decline in fair value of the ARSs compared to their par value is temporary as of September 30, 2008. Considering the decline in fair values has been relatively short in duration and considering the overall quality of the underlying investments and the anticipated future market for such investments, and given the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments until they fully recover in value (including until contractual maturity, if necessary), the unrealized loss is considered to be temporary. However, the Company will reassess this conclusion in future reporting periods based on several factors, including possible failure of the investments to be redeemed, potential deterioration of the credit ratings of the investments, market risk, the Company's continued ability and intent to hold until contractual maturity, and other factors. Such reassessment may result in a conclusion that these investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of these securities is other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company would record a loss in its consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, which could materially adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition.
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The Company recorded the unrealized loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The estimated fair value of the ARSs is classified as noncurrent assets as of September 30, 2008.
In October 2008, the Company received an offer from UBS AG, one of its investment providers, to sell at par value $26,250 of ARSs originally purchased from UBS at anytime during a two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The Company has accepted this nontransferable offer.

4. Inventories
Inventories consist of the following:
 
The Company's policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for products or market conditions. The Company regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors, including forecasted sales or usage, estimated product end-of-life dates, estimated current and future market value, and new product introductions. Purchasing and alternative usage options are also explored to mitigate obsolete inventory exposure. When recorded, reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. Inventory of $32,441 is stated net of inventory

reserves of $9,565 as of September 30, 2008. Inventory of $22,233 is stated net of inventory reserves of $8,377 as of September 30, 2007. If actual demand for products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those the Company projects, additional inventory reserves may be required.

Recapitalization
On March 14, 2006, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the state of Delaware that was adopted by the stockholders prior to the initial public offering that implemented the following changes to the Company's capital stock:
Change in Authorized Shares
The Company's Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the authorized capital stock of the Company from 15,502,199 shares of capital stock consisting of (i) 15,495,325 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share; (ii) 3,437 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Series A Convertible Preferred Stock); and (iii) 3,437 shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Redeemable Preferred Stock) to 100,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of (i) 90,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.
Common Stock
In connection with the initial public offering, 3,436 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by investment funds managed by TA Associates (collectively, the Investors) were converted into 8,590,247 shares of common stock and 3,436 shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock. The conversion resulted in $43,930 being reclassified to the capital accounts of the Company based upon a valuation performed at the time of issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As discussed below, the Redeemable Preferred Stock was redeemed with a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering.
In addition, prior to the initial public offering, the Investors exercised $0.01 per share common stock warrants for 525,040 shares of common stock resulting from the conversion of the Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes.
At September 30, 2008, the Company has reserved 3,198,396 unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under the Company's 2003 Stock Option and Grant Plan and 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.

7. Stockholders' Equity and Preferred Stock (continued)
 
Preferred Stock
The Company's Board of Directors is authorized, without action by the stockholders, to designate and issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Board of Directors can fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. The Board of Directors will make any determination to issue such shares based on its judgment as to the Company's best interests and the best interests of its stockholders. The Company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Redeemed in Initial Public Offering)
Upon the conversion of all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Redeemable Preferred Stock and common stock, a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering was used to redeem all of the shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock for $32,500. The difference between the fair market value of the Redeemable Preferred Stock at date of issuance of $21,070 and the redemption price of $32,500, or $11,430, was charged to retained earnings in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-5, .
Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios
Prior to the initial public offering, the Company had designated 3,437 of its shares of authorized preferred stock as convertible preferred stock.
Redeemable Preferred Stock (Redeemed in Initial Public Offering)
As noted above, upon the conversion of all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Redeemable Preferred Stock and common stock, a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering was used to redeem all of the shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock for $32,500.
Prior to the initial public offering, the Company had designated 3,437 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Redeemable Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, no shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock were authorized or outstanding.

Warrants (Exercised Prior to Initial Public Offering)
Prior to the exercise of the common stock warrants in connection with the initial public offering, the warrants enabled the Investors to put the warrants to the Company at fair value at any time after September 30, 2008. The warrants were thereby considered liability instruments and recorded at fair value based upon independent valuations. The change in the value of the warrants was an increase of $5,466 for fiscal 2006 and was recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as other (income) expense. The warrants were exercised by the Investors on March 14, 2006, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, and the carrying value of $8,133 was reclassified to stockholders' equity.
8. Investment by TA Associates
On September 30, 2003, investment funds managed by TA Associates (collectively referred to as the Investors) purchased 3,436 shares of convertible preferred stock for $65,000. The Company also issued Notes to the Investors (the Notes) aggregating $30,000, bearing annual interest of 12%, which mature September 30, 2009. From the date of issuance, at the option of the holders, the Notes were convertible into (i) senior subordinated notes aggregating $29,995 (plus accrued and unpaid interest), bearing annual interest of 12%, and maturing September 30, 2009; and (ii) redeemable warrants to purchase 525,040 shares of common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. The allocated fair value of the warrants was accounted for as a discount of $1,718 on the Notes and was being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. As the warrants enabled the holders to put the warrants to the Company at fair value at any time after September 30, 2008, the warrants were considered liability instruments and recorded at fair value based on independent valuations. As of September 30, 2005, the common stock warrants were revalued based upon an independent valuation. The change in the value of the warrants was an increase of $5,466 through the date of exercise (total value of $2,667 at September 30, 2005), and a corresponding expense for the increase in fair market value was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as other (income) expense.
In connection with the completion of the Company's initial public offering on March 14, 2006, the 12% senior subordinated convertible notes were converted into $29,995 in 12% senior subordinated notes and 525,040 of $0.01 common stock warrants. As discussed in Note 7, the common stock warrants were exercised by the Investors. The senior subordinated notes were repurchased from the Investors with a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering for

8. Investment by TA Associates (continued)
 
$29,995, along with the payment of a 2% early redemption premium of $600. The unamortized debt discount of $1,033 from the original issue of the 12% senior subordinated convertible notes was charged to interest expense in March 2006 in connection with recording the note conversion and redemption.
9. Income Taxes
The components of the provision for income taxes consist of the following:
 
 
Table of Contents
9. Income Taxes (continued)
 
Reconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the Company's effective tax rates are as follows:
 
Effective October 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The adoption did not have an effect on the results of operations or financial condition. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of October 1, 2007 or September 30, 2008. If interest and penalties would need to be accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, such amounts would be recognized as a component of income tax expense; while prior to adoption of FIN 48, the interest and penalties were recognized as components of interest expense and selling, general, and administrative expense, respectively.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax from multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2008, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for fiscal years before 2005 and is no longer subject to major state or foreign income tax examination for fiscal years before 2004. The Company does not anticipate any material adjustments to its consolidated financial statements resulting from tax examinations currently in progress.

12. Concentration of Credit Risk
 
The Company has a concentration of sales with certain major semiconductor manufacturers that individually represent more than 10% of total revenue. Sales to these major semiconductor manufacturers were as follows:
 
Major semiconductor manufacturer companies comprise a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables. As of September 30, 2008, three customers (Fairchild Semiconductor International Incorporated, ON Semiconductor Corporation, and Texas Instruments Incorporated) comprised approximately 56% of the Company's trade receivables balance. As of September 30, 2007, three customers (Fairchild Semiconductor International Incorporated, STMicroelectronics N.V., and Texas Instruments Incorporated) comprised approximately 55% of the Company's trade receivables balance.
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are cash equivalents, marketable securities, long-term investments, and accounts receivable. All of the Company's cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by major financial institutions. Deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. All of the Company's long-term investments are auction rate securities issued by several state agencies which are AA/AAA rated and collateralized by student loans and municipal revenues and are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third-party insurer. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom the Company makes substantial sales. To reduce its credit risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. The Company does not require collateral; although the Company obtains letters of credit on sales to certain foreign customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollectible accounts. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is determined that the receivable will not be collected.

The offering is being conducted pursuant to an automatically effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2009. In connection with the offering, Teradyne granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of notes, within 13 days of the initial issuance of the notes, to cover over-allotments. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on April 6, 2009, subject to customary closing conditions.
The convertible senior notes due 2014 will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 4.50% per annum, beginning on September 15, 2009, and will mature on March 15, 2014.
The notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of 182.6484 shares of Teradyne's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.4750, a 25% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $4.38 per share of Teradyne's common stock on March 31, 2009. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at Teradyne's option, shares of Teradyne's common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of Teradyne's common stock, subject to Teradyne's option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the notes and shares of common stock for any excess.
Teradyne may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the notes may require Teradyne to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving Teradyne.
Teradyne estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $169.5 million (or approximately $184.1 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes) after deducting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses.
Teradyne expects to use (i) approximately $122.5 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under, and to terminate, its senior secured credit facility and (ii) a portion of the net proceeds of the offering for the cost of the convertible note hedge transaction described below after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds of the warrant transactions described below. Remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
Concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Teradyne entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "hedge counterparty") with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the notes. Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Teradyne entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of $7.6650 per share, which is 75% higher than the closing price of Teradyne's common stock on March 31, 2009. The convertible note hedges are
expected to reduce the potential dilution to Teradyne's common stock upon any conversion of the notes. However, the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of Teradyne's common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the size of the convertible note hedge transaction will be increased accordingly on a pro rata basis and the warrant transaction may be increased.
In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparty has advised Teradyne that the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne's common stock and/or purchase shares of Teradyne's common stock or other securities, including the notes, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the price of Teradyne's common stock. In addition, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne's common stock or by selling Teradyne's common stock or other securities, including the notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes). These activities could adversely impact the value of Teradyne's common stock and the notes.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering.
The offering of the notes was made pursuant to a registration statement filed by Teradyne with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available for review on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The offering of the notes will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and related prospectus. Copies of the prospectus supplement and related prospectus for the offering, when available, can be obtained from the joint-book running managers at the following addresses or telephone numbers:

Convertible Senior Notes
On April 6, 2009, Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") completed a registered underwritten public offering of $190 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2014 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated March 31, 2009, among the Company, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.
The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158282), including the prospectus supplement dated March 31, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus contained therein dated March 30, 2009, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of April 6, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture (including the form of Note) is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The terms of the Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture are described in the section of the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes entitled "Description of the Notes," which is incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the Notes and the Indenture is a summary and is not meant to be a complete description of the Notes or the Indenture. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted. The Notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of 182.6484 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.4750, a 25% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $4.38 per share of the Company's common stock on March 31, 2009. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, subject to the Company's option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and shares of common stock for any excess.
The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the Company.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes, and the interest accrued on such Notes, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default arising out of bankruptcy events, the principal amount of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon will automatically become immediately due and payable.
In connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes, the following exhibits are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference into the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158282) relating to the Notes offering: (i) the Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report), (ii) the Indenture (Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report) and (iii) the legal opinion of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report).
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
Concurrently with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "hedge counterparty") with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The convertible note hedges will cover, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, approximately 34,703,196 shares of the Company's common stock.
Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of $7.6650 per share, which is 75% higher than the closing price of the Company's common stock on March 31, 2009. The warrants will be net share settled and will cover, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, approximately 31,963,470 shares of the Company's common stock. On April 1, 2009, the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, an additional 2,739,726 shares of the Company's common stock. However, the Company will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34,526,500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants (which amount represents less than 19.99% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock as March 31, 2009, without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction), subject to customary antidilution adjustments.
The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. However, the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant. The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to the Company, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $21.7 million.
In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparty has advised the Company that the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company's common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the
Company's common stock or by selling the Company's common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes). These activities could adversely impact the value of the Company's common stock and the Notes.
The warrants were issued to the hedge counterparty pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. There were no underwriting commissions or discounts in connection with the sale of the warrants.
The summary of each of the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the related agreements, which are included as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information required by Item 2.03 relating to the Notes and the Indenture is contained in Item 1.01 above under the section "Convertible Senior Notes" and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information required by Item 3.02 relating to the warrant transactions is contained in Item 1.01 above under the section "Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions" and is incorporated herein by reference.

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in its capacity as QIU, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, to which the QIU may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions

(c) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall
 
not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection, except to the extent that the indemnifying party suffers actual prejudice as a result of such failure. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify any indemnified party for any amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in settlement of any action, proceeding or investigation without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 9(d) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have responded to the indemnified party's request for reimbursement of fees and expenses of counsel prior to the date of such settlement.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
 
sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any
 
liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to
 
purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to a Subsequent Time of Delivery, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason other than circumstances arising under Section 8(f) (except for 8(f)(ii)), any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the offer, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the representatives.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(d) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Engagement Letter between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. dated as of September 1, 2008.
 
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any and all persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters, imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Note. Initially, the Global Note shall be issued to the Depositary, registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co.
 
If (i) the Depositary notifies the Company at any time that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days, (ii) the Depositary ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days or (iii) an Event of Default in respect of the Notes has occurred and is continuing, upon the request of the beneficial owner of the Notes, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate and a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes, will authenticate and deliver Notes in definitive form to each such beneficial owner of the related Notes (or a portion thereof) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Note, in exchange for such Global Note, and upon delivery of the Global Note to the Trustee such Global Note shall be canceled.
Definitive Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of the Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.06(d) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall deliver such definitive Notes to the Persons in whose names such definitive Notes are so registered.
At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred to a transferee who receives definitive Notes therefor or any definitive Note is exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.

In case any Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon its written request the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes.
The Trustee or such authenticating agent may authenticate any such substituted Note and deliver the same upon the receipt of such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Company and, if applicable, such authenticating agent may require. Upon the issuance of any substitute Note, the Company or the Trustee may require the payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or
 
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Note that has matured or is about to mature or has been tendered for repurchase upon a Fundamental Change or is about to be converted into cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, including without limitation if a Note is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence of their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.08. Pending the preparation of Notes in certificated form, the Company may execute and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall, upon written request of the Company, authenticate and deliver temporary Notes (printed or lithographed). Temporary Notes shall be issuable in any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the Notes in certificated form but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Notes in certificated form. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or such authenticating agent Notes in certificated form (other than any Global Note) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note) may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 5.02 and the Trustee or such authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes in certificated form. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor.

In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.

The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04 may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default or rescind a declaration of acceleration hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of premium, accrued and unpaid interest or any accrued and unpaid Extension Fee on, or the principal (including any Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) of, the Notes when due that has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.01, (ii) an uncured failure by the Company to deliver cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, upon conversion of the Notes or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 11 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected so long as, in each case, (x) such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (y) all existing Defaults and Events of Default (other than as a result of (i) or (ii) above) that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 7.09, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

then, in any such case, the Company may by a Board Resolution remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 7.11, any Noteholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee.

Section 8.11. Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.10 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act.
Acceptance by Successor Trustee.

Once the Company has given such notice, holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution or (ii) the announcement by the Company that such distribution will not take place, even if the Notes are not otherwise convertible at such time (in which event holders will be permitted to withdraw any Notes submitted for conversion in connection with such distribution). Holders may not exercise the conversion right described in this Section 15.01(b)(ii) if they may participate (as a result of holding Notes, and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in any of the transactions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) as if such Noteholders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, multiplied by the principal amount of Notes held by such holders divided by $1,000, without having to convert their Notes.
Holders will also have the right to convert their Notes if the Company is a party to a combination, merger, recapitalization, reclassification, binding share exchange or other similar transaction or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which
 
the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, that does not also constitute a Fundamental Change. In such event, holders will have the right to convert their Notes at any time beginning on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company notifies holders of such transaction and (ii) the effective date of such transaction and ending on the 35th Scheduled Trading Day following the effective date of such transaction. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to notify holders and the Trustee at least 30 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of any such transaction, and in any event will give such notice no later than the actual effective date of any such transaction.
(iii) In the event of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall notify the holders and the Trustee of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change no later than the date on which such event occurs or becomes effective (the ""). The Company shall issue a press release on such date indicating the Fundamental Change Effective Date. A Noteholder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the Fundamental Change Effective Date until the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Fundamental Change.
Fundamental Change Effective Date
(iv) Prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding December 15, 2013, the Notes may be surrendered for conversion beginning in any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2009, and only during such calendar quarter, if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for 20 or more Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the then-applicable Conversion Price on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter. The Conversion Agent, on behalf of the Company, shall determine at the beginning of each calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2009, whether the Notes may be surrendered for conversion in accordance with this clause (iv) and shall notify the Company and the Trustee.
Section 15.02. . (a) Subject to this Section 15.02, upon any conversion of any Note, the Company shall deliver to converting Noteholders,

(ii) on the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion, cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the 25 VWAP Trading Days during the related Observation Period; or
(iii) on the third Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 25 VWAP Trading Days during the related Observation Period, in each case, if applicable, subject to Section 15.02(k).
The applicable settlement method for any particular conversion of Notes (pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above) shall be determined pursuant to Section 15.02(b).
 
(b) Prior to the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, the Company may elect to repay Notes tendered for conversion pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 15.02(a) (or, if the Company has made the Net Share Settlement Election on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date, clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a)) by providing notice (a "") to the converting Noteholders through the Conversion Agent (by requesting in writing that the Conversion Agent provide the Consideration Notice) of the applicable settlement method no later than the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the related Conversion Date or by making the Net Share Settlement Election. If the Company does not provide a Consideration Notice in respect of a conversion and has not made the Net Settlement Election, conversion of the applicable Notes will be settled pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a).
Consideration Notice
Prior to the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, if the Company has not made the Net Share Settlement Election, the Company may deliver a one-time Consideration Notice to the Noteholders, the Trustee, the Conversion Agent and the Paying Agent designating the settlement method (clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 15.02(a) or, if the Company has made the Net Share Settlement Election, clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a)) for all conversions that occur on or after the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding such Maturity Date. For conversions that occur on or after the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, if the Company has not delivered the one-time Consideration Notice referred to in this Section 15.02(b) and has not made an irrevocable Net Share Settlement Election, conversion of the Notes will be settled in accordance with clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a).
At any time on or prior to the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, the Company may deliver a one-time irrevocable notice to the Noteholders, the Trustee, the Conversion Agent and the Paying Agent electing to settle all conversions of the Notes from the date of such notice pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a) (the "").

Net Share Settlement Election
The Company may irrevocably renounce the right to the Net Share Settlement Election by notice to the Trustee at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date and (ii) the Company's exercise of such right to the Net Share Settlement Election. Upon such renunciation, the Company shall no longer have the right to the Net Share Settlement Election with respect to the Notes, and any such attempted election shall have no effect.
The Company will settle all conversions by holders of Notes converting on the same Trading Day in the same manner. Except for all conversions that occur on or after the 60th Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, the Company will have no obligation to repay any Notes tendered for conversion on different Trading Days in the same manner.
(c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (i) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to the amount of interest, if any, payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 15.02(i) and, if required, all transfer or similar taxes, if any, and (ii) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (1) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (Exhibit B hereto) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any
Notice of Conversion
 
shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, pay funds equal to the amount of interest, if any, payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 15.02(i), (4) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (5) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any as set forth in Section 15.02(f). The Trustee (and if different, the relevant Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 15 on the date of such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 16.03.
(d) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in clause (c). If any shares of Common Stock are due to converting Noteholders, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued, and deliver to the Conversion Agent or to such Noteholder, or such Noteholder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such Noteholder shall be entitled in satisfaction of such Conversion Obligation.
Conversion Date
(e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note.
(f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, that may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
(g) Except as provided in Section 15.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
(h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
(i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder shall not receive any additional cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, to, but not including,
 
the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Interest Record Date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the Interest Record Date will receive the interest and Extension Fee, if any, payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Interest Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest and Extension Fee, if any, payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Interest Record Date but on or prior to the next Scheduled Trading Date following the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any, existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note or (3) if the Notes are surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on converted Notes.
provided
however
(j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on (i) the Conversion Date, if the relevant Notes were converted pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a), and (ii) the last VWAP Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period if the relevant Notes were converted pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a); , if such day occurs on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, such occurrence shall not be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive any such shares of Common Stock due upon conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such occurrence shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided however
(k) For each Note surrendered for conversion and converted pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a), the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation, and any factional shares remaining after any conversion pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a) shall, in each case, be paid in cash. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead, the Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional shares by multiplying the Daily VWAP of a full share of Common Stock on (i) the last VWAP Trading Day of the related Observation Period in the case of conversions pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a) and (ii) the Conversion Date (or, if the Conversion Date is not a Trading Day, the next following Trading Day), in the case of conversions pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a), in each case, by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall determine the number of fractional shares for which cash shall be delivered by aggregating (i) all Notes a holder surrenders for conversion and (ii) fractional shares included in the Daily Settlement Amounts over the entire related Observation Period rather than delivering cash in lieu of fractional shares for (x) each individual Note of such holder surrendered for conversion or (y) each day of the related Observation Period.
 
Section 15.03.
Increased Conversion Rate Applicable to Certain Notes Surrendered in Connection with Fundamental Changes.
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Conversion Rate applicable to each Note that is surrendered for conversion, in accordance with this Article 15, at any time from, and including, the date that a Fundamental Change (other than a Fundamental Change described in clause (e) of the definition thereof), (a "") becomes effective (the "") until, and including, the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, shall be increased to an amount equal to the Conversion Rate that would, but for this Section 15.03, otherwise apply to such Note pursuant to this Article 15, plus an amount equal to the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment.
Make-Whole Fundamental Change
Effective Date
As used herein, "" shall mean, with respect to a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the amount set forth in the following table that corresponds to the Make-Whole Reference Date and the Stock Price for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, all as determined by the Company:
Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment
 
, that:
provided however
(i) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Stock Prices listed in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price," or if the actual Make-Whole Reference Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Make-Whole Reference Dates listed in the table above in the row immediately below the title "Effective Date," then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by the Company by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment set forth for such higher and lower Stock Prices, or for such earlier and later Make-Whole Reference Date based on a 365 day year, as applicable;
(ii) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $50.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), or if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $4.38 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in
 
clause (iii) below), then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment shall be equal to zero and this Section 15.03 shall not require the Company to increase the Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
(iii) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to this Article 15 (other than solely pursuant to this Section 15.03), an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is so required to be made, each price set forth in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price" shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such Stock Price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such Stock Price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such Stock Price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Conversion Rate and whose denominator is the Conversion Rate to be in effect, in accordance with this Article 15, immediately after such adjustment to the Conversion Rate;
(iv) [Reserved];
(v) each Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment set forth in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to Section 15.04; and
(vi) in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes exceed 228.3105 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.04.
Nothing in this Section 15.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.04 in respect of a Fundamental Change.
(b) As provided in Section 15.01(b)(iii), the Company shall issue a press release indicating the Fundamental Change Effective Date. If holders are entitled to a Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment, each such press release shall also state that in connection with such Fundamental Change, the Company shall increase, in accordance herewith, the Conversion Rate applicable to Notes and the amount by which the Conversion Rate has been so increased (along with a description of how such increase shall is calculated and the time period during which Notes must be surrendered in order to be entitled to such increase).
(c) The Company will settle conversions of Notes converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change as provided in Section 15.02(a); , however, that in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change in which holders of Common Stock receive only cash consideration for their shares of Common Stock (in a single per-share amount, other than with respect to appraisal and similar rights), the Company shall settle conversions by delivering, on the 10th Business Day after the Conversion Date, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an amount of cash equal to (i) the applicable Conversion Rate on the Conversion Date, increased by additional shares, if any, calculated as set forth in this Section 15.03, multiplied by (ii) the per-share amount of cash consideration paid in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
provided
Section 15.04. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
(a) If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on (x) the Ex-Date for such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such share split or share combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(a) is declared but not paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
(b) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 60 days after the date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Ex-Date for such distribution. The Company shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of the Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights and warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. If any right or warrant described in this Section 15.04(b) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the right or warrant had not been issued.
(c) In case the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its Indebtedness or other of its assets or property other than (i) dividends or distributions (including share splits) covered by Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash and covered by Section 15.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 15.04(c) shall apply, to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Ex- Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP
provided
0
" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on conversion in respect of each Note held by such Noteholder, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive, the amount and kind of securities and assets such holder would have received had such holder already owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the Record Date for the distribution of the securities or assets.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 15.04(c) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 15.04(c) shall become effective as of the close of business on the effective date of the Spin-Off. In respect of any conversion within the 10 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the Trading Day immediately following the effective date of the Spin-Off, references in this Section 15.04(c) with respect to the Spin-Off to ten consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
Subject in all respects to Section 15.10, rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 15.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 15.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 15.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 15.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
For purposes of this Section 15.04(c), Section 15.04(a), and Section 15.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 15.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 15.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 15.04(c) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by
 
this Section 15.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Ex-Date" and "the Ex-Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 15.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 15.04(b).
If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(c) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or announced.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(c).
(d) If the Company pays any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 15.04(d) shall become effective on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution. If any such dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(d) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(d).
(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period beginning on and including the Trading
 
Day immediately following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective as of the close of business on the Expiration Date. In respect of any conversion within the ten consecutive Trading Days beginning on and including the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 15.04(e) with respect to ten consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date of such tender or exchange offer and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
If:
(1) any distribution or transaction described in Sections 15.04(a) through (e) has not yet resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate on a given Trading Day within the Observation Period applicable to Notes that Noteholders have converted; and
(2) the shares Noteholders will receive in respect of such Trading Day are not entitled to participate in the relevant distribution or transaction (because they were not held on a related Record Date or otherwise);
then the Company shall adjust the number of shares that it will deliver to Noteholders in respect of the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
 
If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(e).
(f) The term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock (or other security) have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
(g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right, option or warrant to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
(h) Notwithstanding this Section 15.04 or any other provision of this Indenture or the Notes, if any Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective, or any Ex-Date for any issuance, dividend or distribution (relating to a required Conversion Rate adjustment) occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the open of business on a Conversion Date and ending on and including the close of business on the last VWAP Trading Day of a related Observation Period, the Board of Directors shall make adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, as are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 15.04 and the other provisions of this Article 15 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 15.04(h) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment or other term that would otherwise be applicable.
(i) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 15.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. The Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to this Section 15.04(i), the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. The Company shall not take any action that would result in adjustment of the Conversion Rate (A) without complying with any New York Stock Exchange rule (which requires stockholder approval of certain issuances of stock), if applicable, or (B) in such a manner as to result in the reduction of the Conversion Price to less than the par value per share of Common Stock.
 
(j) The applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of the Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(iv) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock in a transaction not otherwise described in this Section 15.04, regardless of the price at which such shares are issued;
(v) upon the repurchase by the Company of any of shares of the Common Stock pursuant to an open-market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction that is not otherwise described in this Section 15.04;
(vi) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
(vii) for accrued and unpaid interest, including any Extension Fee; or
(viii) for any transactions described in this Section 15.04 if Noteholders may participate (as a result of holding the Notes and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in any of the transactions described in this Section 15.04 as if such Noteholders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate at the time such adjustment would be required, by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Noteholder, without having to convert their Notes.
multiplied
(k) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 15 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(l) The Company shall not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) upon any conversion of Notes (with such adjustments to be made on each day and for each adjustment event occurring during the applicable Observation Period), (ii) such time as all adjustments that have not been made prior thereto would have the effect of adjusting the Conversion Rate by at least 1%.
(m) Except as described in this Article 15, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate.
 
(n) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, within ten days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(o) For purposes of this Section 15.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
Section 15.05. The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.

Merger Event

Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 15. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 16 herein.
 
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 15.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.

The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 15.06. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes as set forth in Section 15.01 and Section 15.02 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.
Reference Property
(c) With respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes surrendered for conversion after the effective date of any such Merger Event, the Company's Conversion Obligation shall be settled in cash or units of Reference Property in accordance with Section 15.02(b) and 15.02(k) as follows:

(iv) For purposes of this Section 15.06, the "" shall mean the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect
Weighted Average Consideration
 
to or in exchange for such Common Stock in any Merger Event who affirmatively make such an election; that, if the types and amounts of consideration that holders of the Common Stock would be entitled to receive with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock is based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the "Weighted Average Consideration" will be deemed to be (A) if holders of the majority of the shares of Common Stock affirmatively make such an election, the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election or (B) if the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock do not affirmatively make such an election, the types and amount of consideration actually received by such non-electing holders.
provided
(v) The Company shall notify the holders of the Weighted Average Consideration as soon as practicable after the Weighted Average Consideration is determined.

(c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company will list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
Section 15.08. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 15.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to

in such Section 15.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in conclusively relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for determining whether any event contemplated by Section 15.01(b) has occurred that makes the Notes eligible for conversion or no longer eligible therefor until the Company has delivered to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent the notices referred to in Section 15.01(b) with respect to the commencement or termination of such conversion rights, on which notices the Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely, and the Company agrees to deliver such notices to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent immediately after the occurrence of any such event or at such other times as shall be provided for in Section 15.01(b).
Section 15.09. In case:
Notice to Noteholders Prior to Certain Actions.
(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.04; or
(b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights, options or warrants; or

(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at its address appearing on the Note Register, provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
Section 15.10. To the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan or other "poison pill" in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each Noteholder will receive, in addition to any Common Stock and in lieu of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company has distributed
Stockholder Rights Plans.
 
to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of Indebtedness or assets as provided in Section 15.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a rights plan that would allow a holder to receive upon conversion, in addition to any shares of the Common Stock, the rights described therein with respect to such Common Stock (unless such rights or warrants have separated from the Common Stock) shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants that would entitle a holder to an adjustment to the Conversion Rate.
Section 16.01. [Reserved]

This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the public offering by Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), of $190,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (including $15,000,000 relating to the overallotment option) (the "Notes") and the shares of the Company's common stock, $0.125 par value per share (the "Shares" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities") issuable upon conversion of the Notes, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-158282) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on March 30, 2009, and the prospectus dated March 30, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus dated March 30, 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") and the prospectus supplement, dated March 31, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
The Notes will be issued by the Company pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (the "Trust Indenture Act").
We are acting as counsel for the Company in connection with the issue and sale by the Company of the Securities. We have examined signed copies of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission, including the exhibits thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Underwriting Agreement dated March 31, 2009, by and among the Company and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). We have also examined and relied upon resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company, minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us by the Company, the Restated Articles of Organization and Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, each as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth.
In our examination of the documents described above, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individual signatories, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to

We are expressing no opinion herein as to the application of or compliance with any federal or state law or regulation or as to the power, authority or competence of such other party to the Indenture. We have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and binding obligation of such other party to the Indenture, and is enforceable against such other party in accordance with its terms.
We have assumed for purposes of our opinions below that no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company or, if any such authorization, approval, consent, action, notice or filing is required, it will have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and will be in full force and effect.
Our opinions below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, usury, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally; (ii) statutory or decisional law concerning recourse by creditors to security in the absence of notice or hearing; (iii) duties and standards imposed on creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing; and (iv) general equitable principles.

In addition, we express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any provision of the Notes requiring the payment of interest on overdue interest.
We also express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than (i) as to the opinions given in paragraph 1, the state laws of the State of New York and (ii) as to the opinions given in paragraph 2, the state laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed that (i) at the time of offer, issuance and sale of any Securities, no stop order suspending the Registration Statement's effectiveness will have been issued and remain in effect; (ii) the Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, which shall have been executed and delivered by the Company and the Trustee and shall contain such terms as shall have been authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company in respect of the Notes; (iii) prior to the issuance of any Shares upon conversion of the Notes, sufficient shares of Common Stock shall be duly authorized pursuant to the Restated Articles of Organization; (iv) the Notes will be delivered against payment of valid consideration therefor and in accordance with the terms of the applicable resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing such sale and any applicable underwriting agreement and as contemplated by the Registration Statement and/or the applicable prospectus supplement; (v) such Shares shall be issued upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the terms thereof, the Indenture and the resolutions of the Board of Directors; and (vi) the Company will remain a Massachusetts corporation.

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to which the Transaction shall be the sole Affected Transaction and Issuer shall be the sole Affected Party and Dealer shall be the party entitled to designate an Early Termination Date pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Agreement and to determine the amount payable pursuant to Section 6(e) of the Agreement; that with respect to any Additional Termination Event, Dealer may choose to treat part of the Transaction as the sole Affected Transaction, and, upon the termination of the Affected Transaction, a Transaction with terms identical to those set forth herein except with a Number of Warrants equal to the unaffected number of Warrants shall be treated for all purposes as the Transaction, which shall remain in full force and effect:
Additional Termination Events
provided
(i) Dealer reasonably determines, based upon advice of counsel, that it is advisable to terminate a portion of the Transaction so that Dealer's related hedging activities will comply with applicable securities laws, rules or regulations or related policies and procedures of Dealer (whether or not such requirements, policies or procedures are imposed by law or have been voluntarily adopted by Dealer), or Dealer, despite using commercially reasonable efforts, is unable or reasonably determines that it is impractical or illegal to hedge its obligations pursuant to this Transaction in the public market without registration under the Securities Act or as a result of any legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements;
(ii) at any time at which any Excess Ownership Position occurs, Dealer, in its discretion, is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party of the Transaction or any other transaction between the parties after using its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms and within a time period reasonably acceptable to Dealer such that an Excess Ownership Position no longer exists; that Dealer shall treat only that portion of the Transaction as the Affected Transaction as necessary so that such Excess Ownership Position no longer exists;
provided
 
(iii) Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of the acquisition by any person or group, including any group acting for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act, in a single transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of a merger, consolidation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of Issuer's capital stock entitled to vote generally in elections of directors;

(A) that does not result in a reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of the outstanding Shares and pursuant to which the holders of Shares immediately prior to the transaction are entitled to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the continuing or surviving corporation immediately after such transaction in substantially the same proportions as their respective ownership of Issuer's voting securities immediately prior to the transaction; or
(B) which is effected solely to change Issuer's jurisdiction of incorporation and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding Shares solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity; or
(v) the first day on which a majority of Issuer's board of directors does not consist of Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction set forth in clause (iii) or (iv) above will not constitute an Additional Termination Event if at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Shares (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights and cash dividends) in connection with such event consists of shares of common stock traded on any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market or the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or any of their respective successors) (or will be so traded or quoted immediately following the completion of the merger or consolidation or such other transaction) ("").
Listed Shares

Continuing Directors
(k) . If, on or prior to the Effective Date, Dealer reasonably determines that it is advisable to cancel the Transaction because of concerns that Dealer's related hedging activities could be viewed as not complying with applicable securities laws, rules or regulations, the Transaction shall be cancelled and shall not become effective, and neither party shall have any obligation to the other party in respect of the Transaction.
Effectiveness
(l) . Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Warrants for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions in the cash market or stock loan market or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Issuer or an affiliated purchaser of Issuer, be compliance with
Extension of Settlement
 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In the event Dealer postpones the Expiration Date for any Component, the duration of such postponement shall be the shortest period of time that Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, is appropriate to comply with the standards set forth in the preceding sentence.
(m) The provisions of Section 2(c) of the Agreement shall not apply to the Transaction. Each party waives any and all rights it may have to set-off delivery or payment obligations it owes to the other party under the Transaction against any delivery or payment obligations owed to it by the other party, whether arising under the Agreement, under any other agreement between parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise.
No Netting and Set-off.

Delivery of Cash
(o) . The parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the Definitions or in the Agreement, following the payment of the Premium, in the event that an Early Termination Date (whether as a result of an Event of Default or a Termination Event) occurs or is designated with respect to the Transaction or the Transaction is terminated or cancelled pursuant to Article 12 of the Equity Definitions and, as a result, Dealer would owe to Issuer an amount calculated under Section 6(e) of the Agreement or Article 12 of the Equity Definitions, such amount shall be deemed to be zero.
Payments by Dealer upon Early Termination
(p) .

The Company used approximately $123.3 million of the net proceeds of its offering of $190 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2014 to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
The terminated Credit Agreement provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $122.5 million, and which was available on a revolving basis until November 14, 2011. At the Company's option, loans under the Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin varying between 3.00% and 3.50% based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate, defined as the rate of interest in effect for such day as announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its "prime rate", plus a margin varying between 2.00% and 2.50% based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the Company was required to pay the Lenders a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.75% of the actual daily unused amount of the commitments of such Lenders under the credit facility. The Credit Agreement contained customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio.
An affiliate of Bank of America, N.A. served as joint book-running manager of the Company's recent registered public offering of convertible senior notes referred to above.

Exhibit Index
 

Exhibit 99.1
NORTH READING, Mass.()Teradyne, Inc (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $121 million for the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's net loss in the first quarter was $65.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, which excludes restructuring charges, acquired intangible asset amortization and special items. The GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $90.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.
BUSINESS WIRE
Bookings for the first quarter were $136 million, including $31 million for Hard Disk Drive test systems.
Guidance for the second quarter of 2009 is for revenue of $120 million to $130 million, with a loss per share between $0.26 and $0.23 on a non-GAAP basis and between $0.44 and $0.40 on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP guidance excludes restructuring charges, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization, and other special items.
"Despite a very harsh business climate in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some initial recovery signs as we enter the second quarter," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Installed equipment utilization rates are starting to turn up and customers are formulating modest capex outlays for new IC products they're bringing to market in the second half of the year.
"We continue to press forward on the new product front in both our Semiconductor Test and Systems Test markets. In the Hard Disk Drive segment, we've received initial orders for our Neptune tester, and we're projecting revenue recognition in the third quarter. We also have very strong operating leverage in our business model as we grow revenues going forward."

Exhibit Index
 

Exhibit 99.1
NORTH READING, Mass.()Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $170 million for the second quarter of 2009. Semiconductor Test revenue totaled $103 million and Systems Test Group revenue totaled $67 million, which included initial Hard Disk Drive test system revenues. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's net loss in the second quarter was $35.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which excluded restructuring charges, acquired intangible asset amortization and special items. The GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $66.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
BUSINESS WIRE
The second quarter revenue of $170 million was $40 million above the high end of guidance while the non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.21 was slightly better than the guidance of $0.26 to $0.23. The higher revenue did not result in a smaller net loss per share due to the previously disclosed zero gross margin on the initial Hard Disk Drive test system shipments and due to inventory charges incurred in the quarter.
Bookings in the second quarter of 2009 were $227 million. Semiconductor Test orders were $138 million and Systems Test Group orders were $89 million, which included additional Hard Disk Drive test system orders.
Guidance for the third quarter of 2009 is for revenue of $190 million to $205 million, with a Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.02 to net income per share of $0.02 and a GAAP net loss per share between $0.13 and $0.09. Non-GAAP guidance excludes restructuring charges, acquired intangible asset amortization and special items.
"We saw significant improvement in our System-On-Chip (SOC) test business in the second quarter from the trough in orders in Q1," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "In SOC, bookings in the quarter were driven by improving demand in wireless and analog/power management from both integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) customers. In our Hard Disk Drive test business, customer acceptance for the majority of our initial shipments accelerated and our lead customer placed a second round of orders. We're ramping the supply chain to meet the increased demand in SOC and Hard Disk Drive at the same time that we hold the line on costs."

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP (loss)/income and non-GAAP (loss)/income per share refer to net (loss)/income and net (loss)/income per common share excluding goodwill impairment, in-process research and development, amortization of the GAAP imputed convertible debt discount, write-off of credit line debt issue costs, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provision reversals, fair value inventory step-up related to Nextest and Eagle Test, losses on marketable securities and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as applicable adjustments to profit sharing and income taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining net (loss)/income. Non-GAAP (loss)/income (which is the basis for non-GAAP (loss)/income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook.
The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Bookings in the second quarter of 2010 were $512 million of which $466 million were in Semiconductor Test and $46 million in the Systems Test Group.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) exclude goodwill impairment, in-process research and development, non- cash convertible debt interest, write-off of credit line debt issue costs, restructuring and other, net, fair value inventory step-up related to Nextest and Eagle Test, (losses)/gains on marketable securities and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as applicable adjustments to profit sharing (prior to January 1, 2010) and income taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income/(loss) from operations and net income/(loss). Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook.

Non-GAAP gross margin excludes charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting. GAAP requires that this item be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for Teradyne's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of Teradyne's competitors. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods.

 October 27, 2010  (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $502 million for the third quarter of 2010 of which $448 million was in Semiconductor Test and $54 million in Systems Test Group. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's net income in the third quarter was $156.4 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest and restructuring and other charges.

NORTH READING, Mass.
Teradyne, Inc.
Bookings in the third quarter of 2010 were $350 million of which $259 million were in Semiconductor Test and $91 million in the Systems Test Group.
Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010 is revenue of $300 million to $325 million, with non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.21 to $0.28 and GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.14 to $0.20. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest and restructuring and other charges.
"In the third quarter, we recorded the highest operating profit rate in Teradyne's history driven by very strong System-on-Chip (SOC) test revenues," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "Our memory test business was stable and we saw order growth in all segments of our Systems Test Group, led by Hard Disk Drive. After five quarters of sequential growth, SOC orders fell sharply as our customers digest the investments made over the last year. Regardless of the duration of this downturn in SOC orders, we're confident our growing market share, lean operating model and strict cost discipline will deliver strong financial performance across the cycle."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 July 27, 2011  (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $411 million for the second quarter of 2011 of which $343 million was in Semiconductor Test and $68 million in Systems Test Group. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's income from continuing operations in the second quarter was $101.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest and restructuring and other charges. GAAP income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $89.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
NORTH READING, Mass.
Teradyne, Inc.
Bookings in the second quarter of 2011 were $333 million of which $257 million were in Semiconductor Test and $76 million in the Systems Test Group.
"We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter marking the sixth quarter in a row of above model profitability," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne President and CEO. "We saw continued strength in Hard Disk Drive Test orders as we expand both the performance and customer base of our Neptune product line. While System on a Chip (SOC) test orders slowed substantially in the quarter, the wireless and media processor, power management, and imaging segments were the strongest, driven by both design wins and capacity expansions."
"With the softening order rate in semiconductor test dictating lower shipments in the third quarter, we're pleased to see increasing HDD test shipments offset some of that decline. While delivering lower gross margins than our other businesses, HDD test is on track to deliver model profitability on record revenues this year."
Guidance for the third quarter of 2011 is for revenue of $320 million to $340 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.22 to $0.26 and GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.15 to $0.18.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 14, 2011, Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with LitePoint Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("LitePoint"), Lager Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger Sub"), and Michael Goguen, as the Stockholder Representative. The Merger Agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of the Company and LitePoint and by the requisite stockholders of LitePoint.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into LitePoint (the "Merger"), with LitePoint continuing after the Merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The aggregate value of the cash consideration to be paid at the closing of the Merger for all outstanding shares and vested equity awards of LitePoint is expected to be approximately $510 million net of LitePoint cash and tax benefits. In addition, up to $70 million, payable in cash or common stock of the Company at the Company's election, would be payable upon the achievement of certain revenue-based performance targets through 2012. The Company has also agreed to assume all outstanding equity awards and stock appreciation rights granted pursuant to equity incentive and stock appreciation rights plans of LitePoint and its subsidiaries that are unvested as of the effective time of the Merger.
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties. Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things: (i) the requisite approval of LitePoint's stockholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the accuracy of representations made by LitePoint in the Merger Agreement, (iv) the performance by LitePoint of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to LitePoint.
Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Company, on one hand, and the stockholders and optionholders of LitePoint that will receive cash consideration in the Merger, on the other hand, have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and other specified matters contained in the Merger Agreement. Approximately $70 million of the cash consideration payable at the closing of the Merger will be held in escrow for a period of 18 months, with half of any amount remaining and not subject to pending claims after 12 months to be released at such time, to satisfy indemnification obligations of LitePoint's equityholders to the Company. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Company will also be entitled to set off earnout payments otherwise payable to Litepoint's equityholders in connection with the satisfaction of such indemnification obligations.
The foregoing is a summary of the terms of the Merger Agreement, and does not purport to summarize or include all terms relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2011.
Item 8.01. Other Items
On September 14, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing that it had entered into the Merger Agreement. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
On September 14, 2011, the Company held an investor conference call to discuss the previously announced acquisition of LitePoint pursuant to the Merger Agreement. A copy of the transcript of the conference call is filed as Exhibit 99.2 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

There can be no assurance that these forward looking statements will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: conditions affecting the markets in which LitePoint operates; market acceptance of LitePoint's new products; competition from larger and more established companies in LitePoint's markets; the protection of LitePoint's intellectual property; the retention of key employees; the uncertainty of regulatory approval of the transaction; the parties' ability to satisfy the merger agreement conditions and consummate the transaction; Teradyne's ability to successfully grow LitePoint's business; and other events, factors and risks disclosed in filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, the "Risk Factors" section of Teradyne's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 3, 2011.

Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.
Now, onto the substance of the call. First, Mike Bradley will review the strategic merit of the acquisition and then Greg Beecher will review the financial details of the transaction. Note that this will be a 30-minute call, and we'll entertain only questions related to the acquisition.
Mike
Michael A. Bradley, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on short notice. I'd first like to say how pleased I am to be announcing our agreement to acquire LitePoint, a dynamic growth company focused on testing wireless products at the final stage of the manufacturing process. For some time now, we've been very impressed by LitePoint's innovative test technology and the talented people behind it. So we genuinely look forward to working together with the LitePoint team.
My comments to our shareholders this afternoon will focus on two things. First is why we're convinced that LitePoint gives us a new and compelling growth engine; and second is why LitePoint is such a good fit within Teradyne from a product, a customer and what I call a DNA perspective. Greg will go through the numbers on the acquisition and the financial contribution of their business going forward. But let me start with what LitePoint brings in growth potential.
LitePoint products are used for production testing of the wireless capability found in smartphones, tablets, eReaders, laptops, access points and the exploding market of consumer devices that have been termed the Internet of Things. The test market for these products is close to $1 billion today, with future growth driven by strong unit volumes, an increasing number of wireless radios in each product, and rapidly changing standards, like 4G LTE in cellular and 802.11ac in Wi-Fi connectivity.
What LitePoint has already accomplished in this area is quite impressive. By focusing on the unique production test needs of these consumer devices, with their explosive introduction ramps and demand for high quality, LitePoint's products are increasingly being selected over their much larger competitors, as those competitive solutions are typically designed around lab instrument architectures, which are then transferred to the production floor.
At Asian contract manufacturers, where many thousands of LitePoint systems are installed, there's a growing demand for fast bring-up of solid turn-key test solutions combined with mass production economics. That's why we believe LitePoint will continue to gain share, which brings me to why a LitePoint and Teradyne combination makes strategic sense.
First, it's in our sweet spot of test. You couldn't find a market adjacency for us that is as close in technology and in customers as LitePoint offers, while at the same time, opening a sizable new market. Whether it's in semiconductor and chip set design, end customers or contract manufacturers, the technology and distribution footprint is highly connected.
Second, there's no overlap in markets. Rather, LitePoint addresses a complementary test insertion that completes the wafer, chip subsystem and final product test flow for complex consumer electronics.
Third, wireless test is our largest SOC market, so we're enhancing our intimacy with the market leaders from chip design to production. And finally, our two companies share a number of what I'd call genetic traits. We both have great engineering depth and a culture of innovation in the test

arena. We both create system architectures that solve time to market and production flow requirements for the industry's most complex consumer electronics. And frankly and finally, from a values perspective, LitePoint looks and feels like Teradyne, smaller, of course, but quite similar in its cultural DNA.
One last thing before I turn it over to Greg. This will be our third acquisition since 2008, when we added Nextest and Eagle Test. Both of those companies have had great strategic impact in strengthening our competitive position, opening up new markets and delivering exceptional financial performance. In both prior cases, we added great products and development teams in closely adjacent markets. We leveraged our distribution footprint in Asia and we gradually shared technology without disrupting product road maps or the momentum of their design teams.
We believe the LitePoint combination will be similar in three respects. First, we'll focus on growing their business, specifically to expanding their customer support base in Asia. Second, we'll keep their product road maps intact and third, we'll back them with the scale and resources of our balance sheet and depth of talent. So, we're energized for the opportunity to combine forces with a great organization for which we have the highest respect and to add another impressive growth engine to our stable.
Now, let me turn it over to Greg.
Gregory R. Beecher, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP
Thanks, Mike. Let me quickly highlight the financial aspects of the deal. We expect to acquire LitePoint for $510 million net of LitePoint cash and tax benefits, plus an additional $70 million if certain performance targets are achieved through 2012. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
LitePoint will be run as a separate business unit of Teradyne, led by its founders and strong management team. We've been very impressed with what this team has accomplished and by their future growth potential. This year in 2011, LitePoint is on track to achieve between $125 million and $135 million in sales, up from $86 million the year before. We expect LitePoint sales to grow greater than 20% a year.
Based upon 2012 published consensus estimates, we expect the transaction to be 10% or more accretive in 2012, excluding purchase accounting impacts. LitePoint is expected to deliver higher gross margin and operating profitability percentages than our existing businesses and will benefit from Teradyne's favorable tax attributes. We fully expect to earn our cost of capital of 15% and then some. Looking further out, we expect LitePoint to be our second largest segment, exceeding the Systems Test Group segment.
While the headline of this combination is about adding a high-growth, complementary test business serving an expanding wireless market, it is also about the prudent use of our balance sheet. You will no doubt recall that we've had a very positive track record with both the Eagle and Nextest acquisitions, which have proven to be very good uses of our balance sheet.
As LitePoint is a private company and less known, let me quickly put it in context with our other growth initiatives. First, LitePoint is in a market that has much higher secular growth than Eagle or Nextest. However, unlike Eagle and Nextest, we do not expect cost synergies. While we call on many of the same customers and have similar technological challenges, there is no overlap.
LitePoint is also similar to hard disk drive in that it gets us into a new test node, that of testing a
more finished or fully-assembled product. In short, LitePoint helps brand and chipset companies get

their new products to market in weeks versus months, and they do this while also providing the lowest cost of test. They bring an easy-to-use, plug-and-play solution for contract manufacturers designed for high-volume production testing, rather than for lab test.
Now moving back to the balance sheet, post-closing of this transaction, we'll have over $700 million in cash and marketable securities, providing us with ample flexibility for the future. We'll provide more detail on LitePoint, including the impacts to our model, in our October earnings conference call.
In closing, as you can no doubt tell, we are very excited to have LitePoint join Teradyne. Now let me turn it back to Andy.
Andrew Blanchard, Vice President-Investor Relations

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<QPaul ThomasBank of America Merrill Lynch>: Hi and good afternoon, this is Paul Thomas for Krish Sankar. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, congratulations on the deal. I wanted to ask, in the recent past, you've talked about opportunities you identified, but couldn't get to the right valuation. And could you talk a little bit about the valuation metrics here and maybe what changed for LitePoint over the last couple of months that helped you guys come to an agreement?
<A- Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: This is Greg. First of all, I think this is a very fair deal for both sides. I think it's a very good, very good transaction for LitePoint, and I think it's also a very good transaction for Teradyne. I can walk you through some of the comparables, if that's helpful, but we've looked at this transaction each and every way you can, whether it's discounted cash flows, comparable multiples. And no matter which way we look at it, it does come out quite fair to both parties. So this is a transaction thatthey're hard to come by to have one this close with this strong of a business model and growth and then to be also able to agree upon valuations. So we're very pleased that we could thread that needle.
<QPaul ThomasBank of America Merrill Lynch>: Okay, then maybe one quick follow-up on the margins. You mentioned 10% or greater than 10% accretion to next year. They're higher than your corporate average margins today? Or you're expecting them to get there next year?
<AGregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: They are higher today.
<QPaul ThomasBank of America Merrill Lynch>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Wenge Yang with Citigroup.
<QWenge YangCitigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, you mention about the market size of $1 billion and you look at the revenue for LitePoint, it's around $100 million. So it's about 10% of the market. Who are their major competitors? And where is the company ranked in terms of the competitive field?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: Wenge, this is Mike. This is a market that is not as well tracked as some of the other semiconductor equipment markets, and we've estimated this market size based upon some of the companies that follow the industry and some extrapolations around that. So there's an estimation here of about $1 billion. But in answer to your question, the big suppliers in this space are companies like Agilent and Rohde & Schwarz. But the rankings are not listed and those companies don't break out the segments of their business. So it's actually not possible to put a batting order ranking on who's who.
<Q -Wenge YangCitigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Okay. In terms of next year's contribution, you mentioned about 10% accretive based on today's Street estimate, and as we all know, Street estimate could well change in the coming months and quarters. So is it more safe to kind of model $150 million revenue and a $0.15 contribution on the EPS?
<A- Michael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: I think you can do that. I think this business standalone, those are very achievable numbers.

Teradyne, Inc. Acquisition of LitePomt
Corporation by Teradyne,
TER Inc Call Sep. 14, 2011 Company Ticker Event Type Date <QWenge YangCitigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Okay. Just so one quick last question; obviously, Teradyne's doing very well with the wireless chip makers. Is there any inputs from the chip makers in terms of your acquisition to LitePoint?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: No. The chip makers are learning about this acquisition at this point, so there's no input yet.
<QWenge YangCitigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Okay. Thank you. Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Great. Thanks so much. Just a simple question; I mean my sense herefirst of all, congratulations on terrific use of the capital on the balance sheet. Secondly, in terms of the questions, it looks like this is going to beyou're adding substantially more than 10% of your revenue next year. And if the margins are better, is there anything other than conservatism that's causing you to say that it wouldn't add more than 10% to the EPS?
<A- Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: Jim, this is Greg. Imy comments were more than 10%. So.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Right.
<A- Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: Or 10% or more. So, yes, I probably am conservative at 10%, but we want to get LitePoint inside Teradyne.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Sure.
<A-Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: Even though it's completely separate and have a little bit more track record and deliver against what we've said in a positive manner.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Sure. That makes sense. And then maybe if we can drill down a little bit on the opportunity, how significant or important is the 4G test opportunity, both maybe on the handset side and even on the infrastructure side relative to what LitePoint and now Teradyne is going to be focused on here? How much of that ishow much of the growth is being driven by that 4G test segment?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: Jim, I can't give you the numerical breakdown. It's a very big portion of it. The changes in technology really create a disruption, so that the test equipment turnover here is faster than you'd find it in the semi-test space.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Yeah.
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: So with the number of radios, with the increasing bandwidth, speeds and so on, all of that really drives a technical turnover here that's quite significant. And that's one of the pieces that we think LitePoint is well aligned to take advantage of.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: And then, I know it's hard, because you're just buying it. But you mentioned Agilent, Rohde. Aeroflex plays in this space. Can you comment a little bit more specifically, maybe a little bit more technically on what the advantages are here versus some of the existing competition?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: Jim, I think we'll do that as we go forward-
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Okay.

<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: In subsequent calls. I think the thing that really intrigued us about what LitePoint has here is that they've got a nice combination of technology that is aligned with the chipset manufacturers for new product launches. And they've got a very, very good economic equation. And they put those together and linked the design side with the manufacturing side. And they really deliver a very effective production solution that works right out of the box. So it's more than a kind of product-by-product comparison.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: Very helpful.
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: But we'll talk some more about that in the future.
<QJames CovelloGoldman Sachs & Co.>: I appreciate it. Thanks, again, and congratulations.
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
<QSatya Kumar- Credit Suisse (United States)>: Yeah. Hi. Thanks and congratulations from me as well on the acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about the manufacturing model for LitePoint over the years, because you've done a pretty good job with your manufacturing efficiency and how the model sort of scales up and down with the downturn? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how advanced LitePoint is on the manufacturing side?
<AGregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: This is Greg. They actually are quite advanced, as you can see by their growth rate. They've done a spectacular job responding to some very demanding customers and have completely met the ramps necessary. They do outsource the significant part of their manufacturing.
I should step back and just be very clear that this acquisition for Teradyne is truly solely about growth. We don't see cost synergies hard stop. With Eagle and Nextest, there were some cost synergies that made sense and wouldn't disrupt the business and we could also help them grow faster. With this business, there is very little in the way of common sense cost synergies. So we don't even have a hint of any thought that somehow, we can improve their manufacturing model. We think it is very efficient and well run.
<QSatya KumarCredit Suisse (United States)>: Okay. And would you be able to talk at some point about how this sort of plays into your gross margin and OpEx and all that stuff?
<A- Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: Yes. I was planning on doing that in the next conference call, to give you an update on the model.
<QSatya Kumar- Credit Suisse (United States)>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
<QAtif MalikMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and, Mike and Greg, congratulations on the acquisition. First question, can you talk about the growth of this business two to five years out? Is it fair to assume that the growth of this business isshould be in line with the handset smartphone units?

<A- Gregory BeecherTeradyne, lnc.>: I mean, that's one thing you track it to. But there's some other things going on. There's the Internet of Things. I think that will fuel some additional growth. There's also some obsolescence. So as we said in our prepared remarks, growth of greater than 20%. We feel reasonably comfortable with that and it certainly could be a bit higher than that.
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: But, Atif, it's more than the growth of the end market. It really is a share growth story. The $86 million last year moving up to in the $125 million, $135 million level here means that the share position has moved up into the teens at this point. We think there's upside to that that's considerable, and the applications and customers are really unfolding here. So the actual growth willit will surpass the growth of the device market and the growth of the test market, we believe.
<QAtif MalikMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC>: Great. And then is there any concentration for customers, 10% or 20% customers for the company?
<AAndrew BlanchardTeradyne, lnc.>: Atif, yes, there is, but we're not going to get into that at this point. But they won't be greater than 10% at the Teradyne level, but at the LitePoint level, there is a greater than 10% customer.
<QAtif MalikMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC>: Okay. And the last thing, your Semi Test business could be volatile and seasonal, especially in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason to believe that this business follows the same kind of seasonality that the Semi Test follows, or is it quite different from that?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: At this point, we're not sure, because they've grown through the cycles so far. I think there likely will be some tooling similarities to what you see in semiconductor tests. But frankly, we're quite, I'll say, insulated. We don't look at the volatility as an issue in terms of how we plan the business, because we've got such a variable cost model on the manufacturing side. We've got the same principlesLitePoint has the same principles as we do with regard to keeping the R&D spending going as these seasonality shifts take place. So this is not a counter-cyclical play. It'sand we do expect that it'll have some of the same seasonality characteristics as Semi Test.
<QAtif Malik- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC>: Okay, and who is making the CapEx decision for this equipment. Is it again like Semi Test, where your IDMs and OSATs are making decisions, or is it one or the handset OEMs are dictating the decisions on the purchases?
<AMichael BradleyTeradyne, lnc.>: Well, it's similar and that's one of the other things that's similar between our semiconductor business and this business, is that it's a multi-node decision process. The brands are driving it, the chipset manufacturers and their technology are driving it. And so it's a three-way decision process and you have to be effective at accessing all three of the nodes, and I'm including the OSATs in those three.
<QAtif MalikMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC>: Great, thanks. Operator: Now for the.
<AAndrew BlanchardTeradyne, lnc.>: I think that's it, if there are no further calls, Kristin. No further questions?

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On October 5, 2011, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") completed its acquisition of LitePoint Corporation ("LitePoint") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 14, 2011, among Teradyne, LitePoint, Lager Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne ("Merger Sub"), and Michael Goguen, as the Stockholder Representative. Upon the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into LitePoint (the "Merger"), with LitePoint continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne.
The aggregate purchase price paid by Teradyne for this acquisition was approximately $510 million net of LitePoint cash and tax benefits. In addition, up to $70 million, payable in cash or common stock of Teradyne at Teradyne's election, is payable upon the achievement of certain revenue-based performance targets through 2012. Teradyne has also assumed all outstanding equity awards and stock appreciation rights granted pursuant to equity incentive and stock appreciation rights plans of LitePoint and its subsidiaries that were unvested as of the effective time of the Merger.
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1(1) to this report and is incorporated in this report by reference.
The Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Teradyne, the Merger Sub or LitePoint. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. Certain of the representations and warranties have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (i) are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure schedule that the parties have exchanged, (ii) were made only as of the date of such agreement or a prior, specified date, and (iii) in some cases are subject to qualifications with respect to materiality, knowledge and/or other matters, including standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement or the date of the Merger, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Teradyne's or LitePoint's public disclosures. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Teradyne or LitePoint or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the acquisition is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by the parties in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Participating Rights Holders and Parent from the resolution of the dispute.

The Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under this . The other party's only defense to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or upon the Independent Accounting Firm. Absent such fraud, such other party shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

 October 26, 2011  (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $344 million for the third quarter of 2011 of which $241 million was in Semiconductor Test and $103 million in Systems Test Group. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's income from continuing operations in the third quarter was $66.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest and acquisition related costs.

Bookings in the third quarter of 2011 were $240 million of which $196 million were in Semiconductor Test and $44 million in the Systems Test Group.
"Record hard disk drive test shipments in the third quarter combined with our lean operating model to produce our seventh consecutive quarter of above model profitability," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne President and CEO. "Semiconductor test orders and revenue softened in line with industry trends during the quarter, but we continued to see relative strength in the mobility segments driven by power management, image sensors, wireless and mobile processors."
"Our recent acquisition of LitePoint adds another growth engine to Teradyne's portfolio of test solutions," noted Bradley. "This strategic use of capital significantly enlarges our served market into wireless product testing."
Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is for revenue of $270 million to $300 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.08 to $0.16 and GAAP loss from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.10 to $0.02.

The Board of Directors
LitePoint Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of LitePoint Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LitePoint Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As disclosed in note (10) of the Consolidated Financial Statements, LitePoint Corporation agreed to be acquired by Teradyne, Inc. on September 14, 2011.

The Board of Directors
LitePoint Corporation:
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of LitePoint Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2010. This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial information taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As disclosed in note (10) of the Consolidated Financial Statements, LitePoint Corporation agreed to be acquired by Teradyne, Inc. on September 14, 2011.

LitePoint Corporation (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in April 2000. The Company designs, develops, markets, and supports advanced wireless test solutions for developers and marketers of branded wireless products worldwide.
 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions in reporting certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2011 (unaudited) included $12,050,802 and $5,549,089, respectively, of money market funds.
 
Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments in marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Investments in marketable securities with original maturities in excess of one year are classified as long term.
The Company accounts for its marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase. The marketable securities include commercial paper, corporate bonds and government securities. The Company's marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method. Unrealized losses are evaluated to determine if they are other than temporary. If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, the Company assesses whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an
 
 
impairment is considered other than temporary based on conditions (i) and (ii), the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit losses, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors such as duration and severity of the unrealized loss, credit ratings, prepayment speeds, defaults and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. The Company had no gross realized gain or losses during the year ended December 31, 2010, and the six months ended June 30, 2010 (unaudited), and June 30, 2011 (unaudited).
 
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not accrue interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable. The Company determines that allowance based upon a review of each receivable and all known factors that affect collectability. These factors include but are not limited to past payment performance, the financial condition of its customers, general economic or industry conditions, disputes regarding the invoiced amount or disputes regarding the product or service rendered. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Certain of the Company's customers receive prompt payment discounts. The Company estimates these discounts and records a reduction to revenue and a credit to accounts receivable.
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are held with a limited number of financial institutions. Deposits held with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company's deposits are credit worthy and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to those deposits. Investments in marketable securities include a diversified portfolio of commercial paper and government agency bonds. All investments are classified as available-for-sale. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. If the parties to the financial instruments described above failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts, and other than the insurance describe above, the Company would incur a complete loss on those financial instruments.
The trade accounts receivable balance consists of a customer base that is dispersed worldwide, with a significant portion due from manufacturers of mobile devices and, to a lesser extent, distributors and resellers. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is concentrated due to the number of large orders recorded in any particular reporting period.
 
 
Customers that represent more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance were as follows:
 
As of December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), approximately 33% and 60%, respectively, of total trade accounts receivable were due from foreign customers.
Customers that represent more than 10% of the net revenue were as follows:
 
Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, but historically has not experienced significant losses related to any particular industry or geographic area.
 
The Company has an agreement with a contract manufacturer to produce its products and provide materials, labor, and overhead. To receive the best price on materials, the Company may occasionally purchase materials to be sold to the contract manufacturer. Inventories consist of finished goods to be sold to customers and components and subassemblies used for assembly of the Company's products. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. A first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to value components and subassemblies, and finished goods are valued using a weighted average cost method. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its inventories and noncancelable purchase commitments by reviewing sales forecasts, material usage requirements, and by reviewing the impact of changes in technology on its products (including engineering design changes). These forecasts of changes in technology, future sales, and pricing are estimates. Inventory is written down to an estimated realizable value as required and charged to cost of revenues. Inventory impairment charges are considered to establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that the original carrying amounts may be recoverable, except when the associated inventory is disposed of or sold.
 
 
The Company subcontracts more than 10% of all of the manufacture, assembly and part of the testing of its products to a third-party contract manufacturer located in California in the United States. As a result of this geographic concentration, a natural disaster or other unforeseen events could result in a disruption in the manufacturing process. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to effectively manage or retain its contract manufacturers, or that these contract manufacturers will continue to operate as a going concern or to meet its future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity. The Company and its contract manufacturers currently buy some key components of its products from a limited number of suppliers, which are manufactured by a limited number of companies. Although, the Company believes that other contract manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar services and components on comparable terms, a change in one of its key contract manufacturers or suppliers could cause a delay in manufacturing, additional cost inefficiencies and a possible loss of sales.
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the underlying assets or the remaining lease term.
The depreciation and amortization periods for property and equipment categories are as follows:
 
 
The Company evaluates long-lived assets, such as equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or asset group. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset or asset group. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There was no impairment in the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the six months ended June 30, 2011 (unaudited).
 
The Company enters into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
The Company recognizes revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred
 
 
when title and risk of loss of products have transferred to the customer, or when the service has been provided. The Company considers the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. At the time of the transaction, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers. If any of the above criteria are not met, revenue is deferred until such criteria are met.
Product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Product revenue, including sales to distributors and resellers, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. The Company's test equipment is sold with embedded software. It was determined that test equipment together with the embedded software function together to deliver the equipment's essential functionality and, as result, the software and nonsoftware components are considered to be a single deliverable. Product revenue accounted for approximately 97%, 97% and 95% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (unaudited), and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), respectively. Revenues from stand-alone software license sales were insignificant.
Revenue from services includes calibration and extended warranty included in the initial sale of test equipment for terms ranging from an additional one to two years. When the Company enters into arrangements that include test equipment, product maintenance contracts (calibrations) and extended warranties, revenue is allocated to the product maintenance contracts and extended warranties based on management's best estimate of the separately stated selling price for the calibrations and extended warranties. Management's best estimate of the separately stated selling price is based on pricing offers made to customers for the separate elements within the arrangement during the sales and order process and gives effect to a customer volume-based discount from list price. Revenue from calibrations and extended warranty included in the initial sales of test equipment is recognized ratably over the related service term beginning in the year following the expiration of the Company's standard warranty. The Company also sells calibrations and, to a lesser extent, extended warranties on a standalone basis. Revenue from standalone sales of calibrations is recognized when the service is performed. Service revenue accounted for approximately 3%, 3% and 5% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (unaudited), and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), respectively. Amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product and service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
From time to time the Company will enter into rebate agreements with some of its customers. The rebate amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred.
 
The Company's products generally include a standard warranty for one year from the date of sale. The warranty accrual is estimated based on historical warranty claim experience. Future costs for warranties applicable to revenue recognized in the current period are charged to cost of revenue. The warranty accrual is reviewed regularly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period. Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. Changes in the warranty accrual balance (included in accrued liabilities) were as follows:
 
 
 
Management believes that changes to estimates for warranty accruals established in the preceding period have been immaterial.
 
Research and development costs consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to software tools, tooling expenses, materials, supplies and equipment depreciation. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options as determined by the Company using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company amortizes the compensation cost using the straight-line method over the vesting period, which is generally four years. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the Company to estimate key assumptions, such as expected term, volatility, and risk-free interest rates, to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding relevant market factors.
 
The Company considers the functional currency of its foreign operations to be the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts, which are re-measured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally re-measured at the average monthly exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in consolidated net income, and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized in other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency transaction gain and losses were a loss of $11,558 and $38,833 and a gain of $32,823 in the year ended December 31, 2010 and the six months ended June 30, 2010, (unaudited) and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), respectively.
 
 
The asset and liability method of accounting is used for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, along with net operating loss carry forwards and credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. To the extent a deferred income tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria, allowances are established. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
The Company uses a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, the Company's results have in the past and could in the future include adjustments to its estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon filing of an amended return, upon change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of statutes of limitation. Accordingly, the effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.
 
The Company operates in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of wireless test solutions for developers and marketers of branded wireless products.
 
In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3, a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements (that is, on a gross basis rather than one net number). The updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximate their respective fair values due to their relatively short maturities.
The following is a summary of the Company's investments:
 
The contractual maturities of investments held at December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 are as follows:
 
 
 
Estimated fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The declines in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature.
The following table represents the Company's investments' gross unrealized losses and fair values, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2010.
 
As of December 31, 2010, there were six out of eleven investment securities that had unrealized losses.
The following table represents the Company's investments' gross unrealized losses and fair values, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2011.
 
As of June 30, 2011 (unaudited), there were thirteen out of twenty-seven investment securities that had unrealized losses.
Substantially all the Company's available-for-sale investments are investment grade government and corporate bonds and notes. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of its amortized costs.
 
 
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 established a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 
 
 
This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
On a recurring basis, the Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
The Company's financial instruments are classified within Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 financial instruments, valued based on quoted market prices in active markets, include money market securities. Level 2 financial instruments, valued based on other observable inputs, include U.S. government agencies, corporate bonds and notes. To the extent deemed necessary, the Company may also obtain nonbinding market quotes to corroborate the estimated fair values reflected in its investment brokerage/custodial statements.
The following tables represent the Company's fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011:
 
 
 
 
 
The following table summarizes the activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts

Property and equipment net, consists of the following:
 
Depreciation expense for property and equipment was $836,160, $373,286 and $574,521 for the year ended December 31, 2010, and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (unaudited), and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), respectively.
 
Accrued liabilities are as follows:
 
 
 
In 2011, the Company entered into a rebate program with one of its customers. Under the terms of the program, the Company will issue a cash rebate related to two specific orders. The rebate is earned as the orders are shipped and is payable, upon customer request, once the orders have been paid in full. As of June 30, 2011, the orders have been fulfilled for a rebate amount of $2,752,149 (unaudited). The rebate was recorded as a reduction of revenue when earned. No further amount can be earned under this program.
 
Other income (expense), net is as follows:
 
 
 
The Company leases office facilities, under noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2014. Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the six months ended June 30, 2010 (unaudited), and June 30, 2011 (unaudited) was $1,186,019, $516,893, and $714,294, respectively. The terms of the facility leases provide for rental payments on a graduated scale. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred, but not paid.
 
 
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations and estimated commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity in future periods:
 
The following table summarized the Company's contractual obligations and estimated commercial commitments as of June 30, 2011 (unaudited) and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity in future periods:
 
The Company has a Manufacturing Services Agreement (Agreement) with a contract manufacturer (CM). The Agreement allows the CM to procure long lead-time component inventory on the Company's behalf based upon a rolling production forecast and purchase orders provided by the Company. The Company is obligated to the purchase of long lead-time component inventory that the CM procures in accordance with the forecast and purchase orders, unless the Company gives notice of order cancellation outside of applicable component lead-times. The Company does not take ownership of inventory from the CM until the inventory is in finished product form. The CM's open commitments and inventory on hand at December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), based on the Company's forecasts and purchase orders, were valued at $13,011,315 and $31,693,793, respectively. If the Company does not honor these commitments, the Company may be liable for the contracted price of all such finished products as well as the costs of the CM's labor.
 
 
During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers in connection with the sales of its products, indemnities for liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties' technology based upon the Company's products, and indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. The Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the various agreements that include indemnity provisions. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement, assigning the rights to its employees' development work to the Company. The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company does, however, accrue for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
In addition, the Company indemnifies its officers and directors under the terms of indemnity agreements entered into with them, as well as pursuant to its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable Delaware law. To date, the Company has not incurred any expenses related to these indemnifications.
From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings and claims arising from the normal course of business activities. Based on current available information, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of any currently pending unresolved matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
The Company has 12,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, which may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The board of directors is authorized to determine the designation of any series, to fix the number of shares, and to alter the rights, preferences, privileges, and the restrictions granted. As part of the recapitalization of the Company in March 2007, the Company issued 10,775,252 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock to a third party investor.
 
 
The rights, preferences, and privileges of the Series A convertible preferred stock of the Company are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share and upon liquidation or dissolution, are entitled to receive all assets available for distribution to common stockholders.

As of December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), the Company had 38,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
 
 
In April 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the Plan). The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to employees and consultants of the Company. Under the Plan, incentive stock options (ISO) may be granted only to Company employees, including officers and directors, while nonqualified stock options (NSO) may be granted to Company employees, directors and consultants. The Company has reserved 6,704,914 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan.
Options under the Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years and at prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the board of directors, provided, however, that (i) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, respectively, and (ii) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO granted to a 10% shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a four year period at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 1/36th of the remaining options monthly afterward, and are exercisable for a maximum period of ten years after the date of grant.
 
 
Stock option activity under the Plan was as follows:
 
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the six months ended June 30, 2011 (unaudited) was $3.98, and $4.84, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the six months ended June 30, 2011 (unaudited) was $18,793, and $5,958, respectively.
At December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 (unaudited) the Company estimated fully vested options and options expected to vest to be 2,785,694 and 3,399,242 with an aggregated intrinsic value of $6,198,522 and $10,009,640 having a weighted average exercise price of $2.57 and $2.97 per share and a weighted average remaining contracted term of 6.27 and 6.5 years, respectively.
 
 
The Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities. The expected term of options granted is derived from the average midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of the option, as described in the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, . The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Share-based compensation expense is reduced by estimated forfeitures based on historical experience. The assumptions used to value options granted were as follows:
Share-Based Payment
 
As of December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 (unaudited), there was approximately $1,680,320 and $2,665,463 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to share-based payments granted under the Company's stock-based compensation plans that will be recognized over a period of approximately three years. Future grants will add to this total, whereas amortization upon vesting of the existing grants will reduce this total.
The options outstanding and exercisable by exercise price at December 31, 2010 were as follows:
 
 
 
The options outstanding and exercisable by exercise price at June 30, 2011 (unaudited) were as follows:
 
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued 25,000 shares of common stock to a nonemployee member of the Company's Board of Directors for settlement of services rendered in fiscal 2009 and accrued as of December 31, 2009, valued in aggregate at $66,001, or $2.64 per share.
During the six month ended June 30, 2011, (unaudited) the Company issued 20,729 shares of common stock to a nonemployee member of the Company's Board of Directors for settlement of services rendered in fiscal 2010 and accrued as of December 31, 2010, valued in aggregate at $99,499, or $4.80 per share.
 
The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) profit-sharing plan covering eligible employees meeting age requirements and length of service. The plan allows for employee salary deferrals and discretionary employer contributions. The Company is not required to contribute, nor has it contributed, to the plan for any of the periods presented.
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company operates as a single operating segment and has one reportable segment.
 
 
The Company's net revenue by geography based on its customers' bill to locations is as follows:
 
Sales between geographic areas are at prices that the Company believes are at arm's length and are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. International sales represent the combined total of export sales made by the Company's United States operations and all sales made by the Company's foreign operations.

Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets are as follows:
 
Reconciliation between the provision for income taxes computed by applying the U.S. federal tax rate to income before income taxes and the actual provision for income taxes is as follows:
 
The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable in future taxable years, and as such, no valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was deemed necessary at December 31, 2010. As December 31, 2010, the Company had no net operating loss or research and development credit carryover for federal and California respectively.
In June 2010, the Company and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agreed on the results of an examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006 and 2007. The examination resulted in immaterial adjustments to the Company 2006 and 2007 returns.
Federal income taxes have not been provided on a small portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. The amount of unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2010 is approximately $164,164.
 
 
There was $736,749 of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 that would affect income tax provision if changed. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 
The Company has adopted the accounting policy that interest and penalties will be classified as a component of the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $33,246 of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various U.S. states and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company's federal and California tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years 2008 through 2010. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of this reporting date.
 
In July 2011, one of the Company's wholly owned Chinese subsidiaries adopted an Appreciation Rights Plan (the AR Plan). The AR Plan provides for the granting of cash-settled rights (Rights) based on the appreciation of the Company's common stock in excess of an exercise price set at the grant date, with maximum appreciation limited to 100 Chinese RMB per Right. The Company has limited the total number of Rights which may be granted under the AR Plan to 100,000.
Rights may be granted only to employees of the subsidiary, including its officers and directors, and to other service providers to the subsidiary, such as consultants. Rights under the Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years. Rights generally vest over a four year period, with 25% vesting on first anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder vesting ratably, monthly over the remaining 36 months. The grants are exercisable for a maximum period of ten years after the date of grant.
In August 2011, the Company granted 36,050 Rights to certain of its Chinese employees at an exercise price of 38.19 RMB each. The Rights vest over a four year period, with 25% vesting on first anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder vesting ratably, monthly over the remaining 36 months. At each reporting date, the Company will accrue compensation expense and an offsetting liability based on the fair value of the Rights at that date, and as adjusted for expected forfeiture rates.
In July 2011, the Company entered into a one year software licensing tool agreement with a vendor for $670,000.
 
 
In September 2011, the Company issued 5,000 shares of common stock to a nonemployee member of the Company's Board of Directors for settlement of services rendered and to be rendered in fiscal 2011, valued in aggregate at $69,450 (unaudited) or $13.89 per share. 2,500 shares were for settlement of services rendered during the six month ended June 30, 2011 and accrued as of June 30, 2011 (unaudited) valued in aggregate at $34,725, or $13.89 per share.
In September 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 1,500,000 shares increase in the number of shares reserved under the 2002 Stock Option Plan. This increase is subject to shareholders' approval to be obtained within the next twelve months.
On September 14, 2011 the Company entered into a plan of merger agreement (Agreement) with Teradyne, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, upon consummation of the merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne, Inc. The Company expects the merger to be consummated in October, 2011.
Management has evaluated subsequent events as they might relate to the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements through October 5, 2011, the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.
 

Exhibit 99.2
On October 5, 2011, Teradyne completed its acquisition of LitePoint Corporation ("LitePoint") located in Sunnyvale, California, for approximately $510 million, net of LitePoint's cash and tax benefits as defined in the merger agreement, and up to $70 million, payable in cash or Teradyne's common stock at Teradyne's election, upon achievement of certain revenue-based performance targets through 2012. The acquisition was completed by acquiring all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of LitePoint. For the purpose of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the acquisition is assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2010 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and as of July 3, 2011 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.

Because these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the acquisition, the actual amounts recorded for the acquisition may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's preliminary estimates of fair value, with the excess purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired being allocated to goodwill. Definitive allocations will be performed and finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Accordingly, the purchase price allocation pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") and LitePoint Corporation ("LitePoint") after giving effect to Teradyne's acquisition of LitePoint, divestiture of Diagnostic Solutions and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Teradyne acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of LitePoint on October 5, 2011.
For the purpose of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the acquisition is assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2010 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and as of July 3, 2011 with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended July 3, 2011 has been derived from:
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 has been derived from:
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 3, 2011 has been derived from:
 
 
Because these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the LitePoint acquisition, the actual amounts recorded for the acquisition may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's preliminary estimates of fair value, with the excess purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired being allocated to goodwill. Definitive allocations will be performed and finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Accordingly, the purchase price allocation pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transaction. The nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition transaction include fair value of acquired inventory and deferred revenue, and investment advisory and legal costs.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Teradyne that would have been reported had the acquisitions and cash payments been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future results of operations or financial position of Teradyne. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that Teradyne may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Teradyne and LitePoint included in the respective Teradyne annual report on Form 10-K and the Teradyne quarterly report on Form 10-Q and attached LitePoint financial statements in Exhibit 99.1.
 
2. DIAGNOSTIC SOLUTIONS DIVESTITURE
On March 21, 2011, Teradyne completed the sale of its Diagnostic Solutions business unit, which was included in the Systems Test Group segment, to SPX Corporation for $40.2 million in cash. Teradyne sold this business as its growth potential as a stand-alone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier. The results of Diagnostic Solutions were classified as discontinued operations and the historical results of Diagnostic Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2010 are removed with pro forma adjustments.
3. LITEPOINT ACQUISITION
On October 5, 2011, Teradyne completed its acquisition of LitePoint for approximately $510 million, net of LitePoint's cash and tax benefits as defined in the merger agreement, and up to $70 million, payable in cash or Teradyne's common stock at Teradyne's election, upon achievement of certain revenue-based performance targets through 2012. LitePoint designs, develops, and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices, including smart phones, tablets, notebooks/laptops, personal computer peripherals, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices.
This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting. The total purchase price of $646.1 million was comprised of (in thousands):
 
The fair value of stock options was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions:
 
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The preliminary allocation of the total LitePoint purchase price to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair value as of October 5, 2011. Adjustments to these estimates will be included in the final allocation of the purchase price of LitePoint, which changes could be material. The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending the final determination of the fair value of certain assumed assets and liabilities. Teradyne expects to finalize the purchase price allocation in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible and net tangible assets was allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of $646.1 million has been allocated as follows (in thousands):
 
Other intangible assets
Teradyne has estimated the fair value of other intangible assets using the income and cost approaches to value these identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to change, which changes could be material. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at October 5, 2011 (in thousands):
 
 
 
Tangible assets and liabilities
Tangible assets were recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value, except for inventory. Teradyne increased LitePoint's historical net carrying amount of certain inventory by $18.3 million to reflect its estimated fair value as of October 5, 2011.
Liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates fair value and the amount expected to be paid, except for deferred revenue. Deferred revenue has been reduced by $16.8 million to reflect its estimated fair value of $3.4 million as of October 5, 2011.
4. HISTORICAL INFORMATION
LitePoint's historical financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 are derived from LitePoint's historical financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to these financial statements to conform to the presentation used in Teradyne's historical financial statements. Such reclassifications had no effect on LitePoint's previously reported income from continuing operations.
5. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended July 3, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 3, 2011:
A. To give effect to cash payments of $572.7 million to acquire the shares of LitePoint and pay Teradyne's acquisition-related transaction costs of $4.5 million.
B. To increase the historical carrying value of LitePoint inventories to the estimated selling prices less the cost of disposal and selling effort, including an appropriate return on sales effort.
C. To record preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill and intangible assets as though the LitePoint acquisition had occurred on the balance sheet date. The pro forma adjustment for goodwill differs from the amount shown in Note 3 as the result of different tangible net asset balances as of July 3, 2011 (the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet) and October 5, 2011 (the date of the acquisition).
D. To record fair value adjustment to LitePoint's deferred revenue.
E. To record estimated fair value of contingent consideration.
F. To record deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets net of a $113.2 million reduction in Teradyne's valuation allowance, recorded as a result of the acquisition.
G. To record the following adjustments to shareholders' equity (in thousands):
 
H. Adjustment to stock based compensation for the effect of Teradyne assuming LitePoint's unvested stock options.
I. To record amortization of intangible assets acquired.
J. To record forgone interest income resulting from cash utilized in connection with the LitePoint acquisition, based on actual cash paid for the acquisition and acquisition costs, and the historical interest rate (0.4%) earned on Teradyne's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
K. To record tax effects associated with the pro forma adjustments recorded in the condensed combined statements of operations on the reduction of interest income.
L. Adjustment to give effect to the impact of assumed LitePoint stock options as they would have been dilutive.
6. NONRECURRING CHARGES
The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended July 3, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 do not reflect the impact on cost of revenues of $18.3 million to reflect LitePoint's acquired inventory at fair value, the impact to reflect LitePoint's acquired deferred revenue at fair value or the impact on selling and administrative expenses of investment advisory and legal costs of $4.5 million incurred by Teradyne as a direct result of the acquisition. Under SEC rules and regulations relating to pro forma financial statements, these amounts are considered to be nonrecurring charges and are excluded from the pro forma statements of operations.

NORTH READING, Mass.
Teradyne, Inc.
Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $376 million of which $233 million were in Semiconductor Test, $123 million in the Systems Test Group and $19 million in Wireless Test.
For fiscal year 2011, revenue was $1.4 billion. Income from continuing operations for the year was $276.4 million or $1.39 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. The preliminary GAAP income from continuing operations was $337.8 million or $1.49 per diluted share. Bookings for the year were $1.4 billion.
"We saw an upturn in customer orders in our System-on-a-Chip (SOC) business and in all lines of our Systems Test Group in the fourth quarter," said Mike Bradley, President and CEO. "The new order increase was driven by very strong demand for leading-edge semiconductor testers for new mobile products and by a broadened storage test customer base. As a result we're increasing our first quarter revenue guidance. We closed 2011 with very solid operating results in both Semiconductor Test and Systems Test, and we added an exciting growth engine late in the year with the acquisition of LitePoint."
Guidance for the first quarter of 2012 is revenue of $360 million to $400 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.22 to $0.33 and GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.05 to $0.13. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset and inventory fair value amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, and restructuring and other charges.
Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance Release
As of December 31, 2011, Teradyne has determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of its deferred tax assets are realizable. Teradyne, accordingly, has recorded a preliminary estimate of its tax benefit for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. The final tax benefit could increase or decrease Teradyne's reported preliminary GAAP income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per share, net income and net income per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2011. The final tax benefit and its impact will be reported in Teradyne's Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. The final tax benefit will not impact the non-GAAP financial results presented in this press release.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, fair value inventory step-up related to LitePoint, deferred tax valuation allowance release and restructuring and other, net. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes, among other things, charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting. GAAP requires that this item be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for the Company's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with our business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of the Company's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Exhibit Index
 

Exhibit 99.1
Q1'12 orders increased 22% from Q4'11 driven by 55% increase in Semiconductor Test and 117% increase in LitePoint Wireless Test
Q1'12 revenue of $397 million, up 34% from Q4'11 and up 5% from Q1'11
Q1'12 diluted non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $0.30 per share, up from $0.17 per share in Q4'11 and down from $0.40 per share in Q1'11; Q1'12 diluted GAAP income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share
Q2'12 guidance: Revenue of $490 million to $530 million; Diluted non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $0.53 to $0.62 per share; Diluted GAAP income from continuing operations of $0.31 to $0.37 per share
 April 25, 2012  (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $397 million for the first quarter of 2012 of which $268 million was in Semiconductor Test, $98 million in Systems Test Group and $31 million in LitePoint Wireless Test. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's income from continuing operations in the first quarter was $60.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset and inventory fair value amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, and restructuring and other charges. GAAP income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $33.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.
NORTH READING, Mass.
Teradyne, Inc.
Bookings in the first quarter of 2012 were $458 million of which $363 million were in Semiconductor Test, $53 million in the Systems Test Group and $42 million in LitePoint Wireless Test.
"Record UltraFlex System-on-a-Chip (SOC) orders drove our Semiconductor Test bookings in the first quarter," said Mike Bradley, President and CEO. "High performance mobile devices continue to drive demand in our Semiconductor and LitePoint Wireless Test segments. In Storage Test, we delivered the second highest revenue in our history as earlier design wins ramp into volume production. Looking ahead, with the mobility outlook remaining strong, we've raised our second quarter revenue plan to meet customer needs."
Guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is revenue of $490 million to $530 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.53 to $0.62 and GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.37. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset and inventory fair value amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, and restructuring and other charges.
Change in Pension Accounting Method
In the first quarter of 2012, we elected to change our method of recognizing gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefits. We believe the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and will improve financial transparency.
We previously recognized gains and losses as a component of shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets annually and amortized them into our operating results to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a specified range. We will now recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses
annually in the fourth quarter of each year. We have applied these changes retrospectively, as required.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, fair value inventory step-up related to LitePoint, pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses, and restructuring and other, net. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting and pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that this item be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for the Company's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with our business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of the Company's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link.

In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, fair value inventory step-up related to LitePoint, pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses, and restructuring and other net, and include income taxes on a cash basis. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting and pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that this item be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for Teradyne's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.
