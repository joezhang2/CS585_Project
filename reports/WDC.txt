Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 31, 2003, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Read-Rite Corporation ("Read-Rite") and an option to purchase the capital stock of Read-Rite International, a subsidiary of Read-Rite. Read-Rite International is the owner of Read-Rite (Thailand) Co. Ltd., a Thailand corporation ("Read-Rite Thailand"). The purchase was made by our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Western Digital (Fremont), Inc., formerly known as RR(US) Acquisition Corporation ("WD Fremont"). We have exercised our option to acquire the capital stock of Read-Rite International.
Read-Rite commenced voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in June 2003. We acquired the assets from the Trustee administering the bankruptcy proceedings of Read-Rite. WD Fremont and the Trustee executed an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 24, 2003 and on July 25, 2003 the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division, issued an order approving the sale of the assets to us. The transaction closed on July 31, 2003.
We acquired assets of Read-Rite including equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual property, business licenses, claims and other assets, and pursuant to our exercise of the option, the capital stock of Read-Rite International. The Read-Rite assets we purchased were used by Read-Rite to design and manufacture magnetic recording heads, head gimbal assemblies and head stack assemblies for disk drives. Substantially all of the employees of Read-Rite at its Fremont, California facility were terminated in June 2003 at the time Read-Rite filed its Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. We are in the process of hiring employees to operate the Fremont, California facility and we intend to use the purchased assets to design and manufacture head gimbal assemblies and head stack assemblies for use in disk drives we manufacture.
The purchase price for the assets was determined by auction and was cash consideration of approximately $95.4 million, including approximately $8.4 million being paid to acquire equipment from certain of Read-Rite's secured lenders. Read-Rite Thailand has un-negotiated debt obligations of approximately $62 million. We funded the acquisition through available working capital. Prior to this transaction, neither we nor our subsidiaries, our directors, our officers or associates of our directors and officers had a material relationship with Read-Rite or any of its affiliates, except that we were a significant customer of Read-Rite prior to its commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.
A copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, which includes the option agreement to acquire Read-Rite International, and each is incorporated herein by reference.

Section 2.3. Assumed Liabilities.

The Sale Order shall provide that the assumption and assignment to Purchaser of the Assigned Contracts set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(i) as in effect on the date hereof is approved, subject only to (i) payment by Purchaser of all cures as determined by a Cure Finding and (ii) the Purchaser's right to exclude any Contract from the definition of Assigned Contracts in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3. For purposes of clarification, unless the Sale Order provides that the sixty (60) day period under section 365(d)(1) is extended for cause until the Contract Determination Date, then the Trustee shall use his commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order from the Court extending the sixty (60) day period under section 365(d)(1) for cause until the Contract Determination Date. (b) The term "CURE FINDING" as used herein shall mean a finding by the Bankruptcy Court in a Final Order determining the amount required to be paid to cure any outstanding defaults under an Assigned Contract so that the Trustee may assume and assign such Contract to Purchaser pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Trustee shall use his commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Sale Order includes the Cure Findings as set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(i) hereto for each Contract thereon. Upon objection by the non-debtor party to any such Contract the Trustee shall either settle the objection of such party (subject to approval of the Purchaser if such settlement sets a higher Cure Finding than the amount set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(i) for such Contract) or shall litigate such objection under such procedures as the Bankruptcy Court shall approve and proscribe. The Purchaser shall be responsible for tendering any cure amounts for each Assigned Contract as determined by a Cure Finding for such Contract, and, subject to Purchaser's right to exclude Contracts from the Assigned Contracts in accordance with Section 2.3, Purchaser shall pay such cure amounts as of the 10
Contract Determination Date. The Sale Order shall provide that the Purchaser may take any action and file any motions or other papers with respect to a Cure Finding required to be taken by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) in place and in the name of the Trustee or that the Purchaser shall pay the legal fees of the Trustee involved in any such litigation. (c) The Purchaser shall have the right to include or exclude any Contract (other than the lease for the Fremont Facility) from the list of Assigned Contracts at any time prior to the date that is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date or, if such date does not fall on a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day (the "CONTRACT DETERMINATION DATE"). Excluded Contracts shall be deemed excluded by their placement by Purchaser on Schedule 2.2 at any time prior to the Contract Determination Date. (d) In the event the Sale Order does not include a Cure Finding with respect to any Assigned Contract, then the Contract Determination Date for such Contract shall be deemed to be and shall be extended until the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date that the Bankruptcy Court makes a Cure Finding for such Contract (if such date would be after the date that would otherwise be the Contract Determination Date). (e) The Trustee shall move the court for entry of an order (the "SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER") pursuant to a motion (the "SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION") to assume and assign to Purchaser any additional Contracts (including the Contracts set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(ii), the "ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS") as identified by Purchaser that, for any reason, are not assumed and assigned to Purchaser pursuant to the Sale Order, with the same effect as if such Contracts had been Assigned Contracts under the Sale Order, including setting a proposed cure amount and seeking a Cure Finding therefor.

(NYSE: WDC) today announced the settlement of its litigation with Cirrus Logic Inc. (NYSE: CRUS). Under the terms of the settlement, Western Digital will make a one-time payment to Cirrus Logic on or before October 17, 2003 of $45 million. As reflected in the company's public filings, Western Digital had previously recorded an obligation totaling approximately $26.5 million relating to this dispute. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the difference of approximately $18.5 million between the settlement amount and the amount previously recorded will be reflected as a charge to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter ended June 27, 2003. The company on July 24, 2003 reported net income of $48.8 million and $200 million for its fourth quarter and year ended June 27, 2003, respectively, or earnings per share of $.23 and $.97, respectively. After taking into account the litigation settlement and related tax impact, the updated net income amounts for the above periods are $31 million and $182 million,
Western Digital Announces Litigation Settlement; Updates Fiscal 2003 Financial Results Page 2 respectively, or earnings per share of $.15 and $.89, respectively. Updated statements of income and balance sheets are attached to this release. The company's financial statements will be filed in its Form 10-K as scheduled in late September. "We are pleased to resolve this long-standing dispute," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "With this settlement, we avoid the continued expense and distraction of this litigation and potential trial, and remain focused on our business." In July 2001, Western Digital stopped paying Cirrus Logic for read channel chips that had been delivered, cancelled all outstanding purchase orders and filed suit against Cirrus Logic for breach of contract and other claims resulting from Cirrus' role as a strategic supplier of read channel chips for the company's hard drives. In August 2001, Cirrus Logic filed a cross-complaint, seeking compensatory damages of approximately $53 million, including the disputed payable of $26.5 million mentioned above. The matter was scheduled to go to trial in December 2003. Western Digital has not purchased read channel devices from Cirrus Logic since July 2001 and all of its current and planned future products incorporate read channel chips from other suppliers.

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 23, 2003, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2003. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2003 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
     The Company's press release reports net income and earnings per share for the quarter ended September 26, 2003. As previously reported, the Company acquired the assets of Read-Rite Corp. in July 2003. The results for the quarter included approximately $45 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges and $5 million of head-design research and development expenses related to Read-Rite. The press release also reports that net income excluding these non-recurring charges would have been $53 million, or $.25 per share. The net income amount of $53 million or $.25 per share is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the $45 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges and $5 million of head-design research and development expenses, reduced by $2 million, the amount of tax expense that would have been recorded had these charges not been incurred. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release and in the conference call are useful to investors in comparing the results of the quarter with prior periods because they provide investors with a basis to measure against prior periods the operating performance of the Company's business without regard to the start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to Read-Rite. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     In a meeting today with analysts in Las Vegas, Matt Massengill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, expects to provide an update on certain current conditions in the hard drive industry, consistent with what was previously disclosed at the JP Morgan Small Cap conference on November 13, 2003. Specifically, Mr. Massengill will indicate that PC OEM demand is good, consistent with expectations and normal seasonal demand patterns. In addition, distribution sell through has been slower than is typical for October, however pricing has been better than expected. Therefore on balance, industry conditions are consistent with the Company's expectations at this point in the quarter.

     In meetings with analysts on December 4 and 5, 2003 at the Credit Suisse First Boston 2003 Annual Technology Conference, the company expects to provide an update on certain current conditions in the hard drive industry. This update will be consistent with the presentation which will be given at the conference on December 5, 2003 (live and archived webcasts of the December 5, 2003 presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at http://www.westerndigital.com/invest/<, presentations page).
     Specifically, the company will indicate that for both the industry and for the company, overall demand across all geographies and channels is at a level expected in a seasonally strong December quarter. In addition, OEM demand has met expectations and distribution sell-through has improved from slower rates in October. Pricing has been consistent with a balanced supply and demand condition and the industry has not experienced allocation at this point in the quarter. The company will also indicate that December sell-through levels, demand and pricing will determine the outcome of the quarter, and typical seasonal improvement in sell-through is anticipated.
     This filing contains forward-looking statements, including statements relating to factors that will determine the outcome of the quarter and anticipated sell-through. The forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations, and actual results may differ materially as a result of several factors, including: difficulties in ramping to volume production a new, complex head manufacturing operation; availability and cost of specialized product components; levels of operating expense and product cost; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies; changes in product and customer mix; pricing trends; actions by competitors; successful entry into new markets by the company; and other factors discussed in our recent SEC filings, including but not limited to our Form 10-K for fiscal 2003.

     The company is providing an update on its expected financial results for the second fiscal quarter ending December 26, 2003, on December 15 & 16, 2003 in meetings with analysts and investors and in a presentation at the Lehman Brothers Global Storage Conference on December 15 (live and archived webcasts of the presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at http://www.westerndigital.com/invest/<, presentations page).
     Specifically, the company will indicate the following: revenues for the December quarter are expected to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million, exceeding its previous guidance of $760 million to $780 million and reflecting a favorable product mix. Earnings per share are expected to be within the previous guidance range of 28 cents to 30 cents a share. Gross margin percentage for the quarter will be lower than the previous guidance of 18 percent. The company will indicate that its gross margin has been impacted by previously cited industry dynamics, including a slower than anticipated distribution sell-through rate earlier in the quarter resulting in less favorable shipment linearity at lower prices in the distribution channel. The company will also indicate that industry weeks of inventory in the channel remain at approximately 6 weeks and that it anticipates industry inventories will exit the quarter at this level as current industry management of sell-in to the channel appears to be appropriate.
     This filing contains forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the company's expectations for revenues, earnings per share, gross margin, product mix and industry channel inventory levels for the quarter. The forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations, and actual results may differ materially as a result of several factors, including: difficulties in ramping to volume production a new, complex head manufacturing operation; availability and cost of specialized product components; levels of operating expense and product cost; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; pricing trends; actions by competitors; and other factors discussed in our recent SEC filings, including our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif. - Jan. 22, 2004 -Reflecting continued successful integration of recording heads into its operations and healthy overall demand for hard drives in traditional and newer markets, Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $835 million on shipments of approximately 12.7 million units, and net income of $68.8 million, or $.32 per share, for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 26, 2003.
       A year ago in the December 2002 quarter, Western Digital produced revenue of $750 million, shipped approximately 10.3 million units and earned $74.4 million, or $.36 per share, in a period that was marked by significant hard drive shortages.
       "We are pleased with our December quarter results, especially in light of challenging inventory and pricing conditions that prevailed in the distribution channel during the quarter," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We were able to partially offset these dynamics with a richer mix of higher capacity drives and the solidly-accretive financial performance of our newly-integrated head operations. Based on recent industry commentary, we believe that weeks of inventory in the distribution channel will be reduced during the seasonally-softer March quarter from the current high levels of the industry's manageable range.
       "Overall demand for hard drives in the second quarter was strong across all geographic marketsreflected by our 12.7 million total unit shipments and sequential revenue growth in each major regionas we continued to participate in a set of multi-year, high-volume growth opportunities in the commercial and consumer markets. In addition to strength in our core desktop PC market, growing numbers of hard drives were shipped into newer markets such as enterprise-class Serial ATA, video entertainment, and external hard drives for system backup and mass storage of digital media content.
Western Digital Announces Second Quarter Revenue of $835 Million and Net Income of $.32 Per Share Page 2
       "We are very excited about our prospects as we enter the new calendar year with a proven team, strong customer relationships, an improved business model, and an extraordinary set of growth opportunities. With continued progress in the head operation, we are in a position to realize additional leverage from this strategic initiative as we work toward greater operational flexibility and the industry's most competitive cost structure."
       For the six-months ended Dec. 26, 2003, Western Digital reported revenue of $1.55 billion, net income of $73.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $.34, compared to $1.33 billion, $96.6 million and $.48, respectively, for the six-month period ended Dec. 27, 2002. The current six-month period results include $45 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges and $5 million of head design research and development expenses incurred in the quarter ended Sept. 26, 2003 related to the Read-Rite asset acquisition.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
       In meetings this week with institutional investors and analysts and hard drive industry participants, officials of the Company expect to provide an update on certain current conditions in the hard drive industry and on its share repurchase program.
       Specifically, the Company will indicate the following regarding the environment in the desktop hard drive industry thus far in the June quarter:
Overall conditions reflect the typical soft seasonality of the June quarter;
Previously cited pricing at PC OEM customers remains aggressive;
Conditions in the industry's distribution channel are balanced: weeks of inventory are within the previously stated manageable range of four to six weeks, and the Company's total inventory is at about the same level as when it began the quarter; and
As is typical historically, demand and pricing dynamics in the month of June will determine the Company's financial performance for the quarter.
       Regarding its share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2004, the Company has repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $16 million, or at an average weighted cost of $8.29 per share.
       Additionally, the Company will indicate that its specific initiatives, such as the ramp of internal head production, 2.5 inch mobile hard drive development, SATA enterprise, and consumer electronics activities, are all on track.
       Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 12.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
           On July 29, 2004, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2004 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
           The Company's press release reports net income and earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 and for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended June 27, 2003.  The non-GAAP measures presented in the press release for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 exclude $50.4 million of first quarter start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Company's acquisition of Read-Rite Corp. in July 2003 and their related tax effects. The non-GAAP measures presented for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended June 27, 2003 exclude a $3.4 million gain on the sale of investment securities, an $18.5 million loss on the settlement of litigation and their related tax effects.  The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors in comparing the results of the quarter and the full fiscal year with prior periods because they provide investors with a basis to measure the core operating performance of the Company's business against prior periods without regard to the start-up expenses and other one-time charges described above.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.  As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
 
 
           Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Western Digital Announces Fourth Quarter Revenue of $749 Million and Net Income of $.14 Per Share Page 2
       Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital, stated: "Sustained execution of our business model is serving us well in a demanding hard drive industry environment. We have strengthened customer relationships in our core desktop hard drive market through predictable supply of high quality products and we continued to expand our business in adjacent storage markets such as digital video recorders and non-PC, IT applications with Serial ATA hard drives. Relative to the hard drive industry, we achieved outstanding financial results, validating the low-cost structure we have put in place to remain profitable even in the most challenging of business environments.
       "Reflecting our focus on cash generation, we realized $73 million cash from operations in the quarter. On a full fiscal year basis, we generated $190 million cash flow from operations and ended with $378 million of cash, even with our acquisition of the Read-Rite assets and the related volume production ramp of heads," said Massengill. The company also repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock in the quarter at a total cost of $16 million.
       The company indicated that fourth quarter pricing in the distribution channel was very aggressive and that it experienced a higher mix of business with OEM customers, which is typically lower gross margin business than distribution. These factors resulted in lower total gross margins of 13.5 percent.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
[   ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425)
[   ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)

[   ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
 
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
The Company is filing this Form 8-K to provide shareholders and analysts certain information concerning its outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and to facilitate communications with shareholders and analysts.  Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following information:
        
Distribution channel sell through in July and August was slower than expected, but has improved thus far in September and is expected to continue to improve through the remainder of the month.  
Sales to OEM customers have been above expectations throughout the quarter, reflecting strength in desktop PC-related demand.  
The Company's channel inventory levels and those for the industry are now less than 6 weeks. The industry's total number of drives in the channel is now lower than at the beginning of the quarter. That number is expected to rise through the balance of the quarter, owing to the anticipated increased sell through as the industry enters the seasonally strongest time of year.  
Overall price declines have been as expected.  
The Company's sales into the PVR industry continue to increase as the Company is expanding its participation in this fast growing market.  
The Company's volumes of Serial ATA interface hard drives continue to show consistent growth as these drives penetrate applications heretofore addressed by SCSI interface hard drives.  
The Company's new 2.5 inch mobile hard drive is on target for volume production in the December quarter.
       The Company indicated that its revenue for the September quarter is expected to be in the range of $765 million to $790 million, with operating expenses tracking to plan at about $80 million.  Gross margin performance for the quarter will be determined by market dynamics in the remainder of September.
       Regarding its share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares at a total cost of approximately $31 million, for a weighted average cost of $7.61 per share.
       This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning the Company's expectations regarding distribution channel sell through and channel inventory levels during the remainder of the September quarter, the Company's entrance into the mobile hard drive market this calendar year and the Company's current outlook for the September quarter on revenue, gross margins and operating expenses.  The forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations, and actual results may differ materially as a result of several factors, including:  pricing trends; actions by competitors; availability and cost of specialized product components; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies; successful entry into new markets by the company; and other factors discussed in our recent SEC filings, including but not limited to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events or for any other reason.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Oct. 25, 2004  Reflecting sustained strong financial performance and operational excellence, Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenues of $824 million on shipments of approximately 14.2 million units, and net income of $30.4 million, or $.14 per share, for its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 1, 2004.
     A year ago in the Sept. 2003 quarter, WD produced revenue of $714 million, shipped approximately 11.3 million units and earned $5.0 million, or $0.02 per share. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew 15 percent and units increased 26 percent. Net income in the year-ago period included $50.4 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Read-Rite asset acquisition.
     Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer, stated: "The WD commitment to quality, reliability and flexibility delivers a business model that advantages us in the competitive, high-volume markets we serve. This is reflected in our sustained industry-leading financial

performance over the last several quarters and in our better-than-expected first quarter results. As a result of this commitment, we have been able to earn higher levels of business with leading OEM customers." In the first quarter, OEM customers accounted for approximately 59 percent of revenue, versus 53 percent of revenue in both the preceding and year ago periods.
     "In the first quarter, we met seasonally stronger demand from our customers in the desktop PC and personal entertainment markets," Massengill said. "We shipped approximately 1.8 million hard drives into personal entertainment applications such as game consoles and digital video recorders, as we continued to expand our presence in markets outside our traditional stronghold of desktop PCs. As part of that same growth strategy, we successfully launched volume production of our WD Scorpio family of mobile hard drives to address the growing notebook PC market and of our WD Caviar RAID Edition hard drives, which are designed and manufactured to deliver enterprise-class reliability in a host of server applications.
     "From a balance sheet perspective, our cash at the end of the quarter grew to $405 million, an increase of $27 million from the June quarter. We generated $93 million in cash from operations, and we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $15 million, for a total of approximately 4.1 million shares repurchased at a total cost of $31 million since the program's inception in May 2004."

Item 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     1. The Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") has previously adopted the Western Digital Corporation 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). According to the preliminary results from the Company's annual stockholders meeting held on November 18, 2004, the Company's stockholders have approved the Plan.
     The following summary of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Plan, as well as the forms of awards which may be granted under the Plan, a copy of each of which is filed as exhibits to this report.
     The Company's Board of Directors or one or more committees appointed by the Board of Directors will administer the Plan. The Board of Directors has delegated general administrative authority for the Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
     The administrator of the Plan has broad authority under the Plan to, among other things, select participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
     Persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
     The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the Plan equals the sum of: (1) 4,500,000 shares, plus (2) the number of shares available for additional award grant purposes under the Company's Employee Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the expiration of that plan on November 10, 2004, plus (3) the number of shares available for additional award grant purposes under the Company's Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Company's Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan as of November 18, 2004 (the Employee Stock Option Plan, the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan are referred to collectively as the "Existing Plans"), plus (4) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the Existing Plans and outstanding as of November 18, 2004 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised, plus (5) the number of any shares of restricted stock granted under the Company' s Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan that are outstanding and unvested as of November 18, 2004 which are forfeited, terminated, cancelled or otherwise reacquired by the Company without having become vested. Upon stockholder approval of the Plan, approximately 3,491,247 shares became available for award grant purposes of the Plan pursuant to clauses (2) and (3) of the preceding sentence. Accordingly, on November 18, 2004, approximately 7,991,247 shares (4,500,000 shares plus the 3,491,247 shares that were carried-over from the Existing Plans) were available for award grant purposes under the Plan, subject to future increases as described above as awards outstanding under the Existing Plans are cancelled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without having been exercised or become vested, as applicable. As of November 18, 2004, approximately 26,813,352 shares were subject to awards then outstanding under the Existing Plans.
     To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for
Table of Contents
issuance under the Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent, stock appreciation right, or other award, only the actual number of shares delivered with respect to the award will be counted against the share limits of the Plan. Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any award under the Plan or the Existing Plans, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any such award, will be available for subsequent awards under the Plan.
     The types of awards that may be granted under the Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common stock or units of the Company's common stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards.
     As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.
     In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors recommended, and, on November 18, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved, a Non-Employee Director Option Grant Program (the "Program") under the Plan. The Program continues, on substantially identical terms, the Company's automatic stock option grant program under the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which terminated concurrently with stockholder approval of the Plan. The following summary of the Program is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Program, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report.
     The Program provides for the following award grants to members of the Company's Board of Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or one of its subsidiaries ("Non-Employee Directors"):
     The exercise price of each option granted pursuant to the Program will be 100 percent of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant of the option. Each option granted pursuant to the Program will have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant of the option and generally will become exercisable as to 25% of the total number of shares subject thereto on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the option and as to an additional 6.25% of the total number of shares subject thereto at the end of each of the next 12 three-month periods thereafter.
     2. The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors recommended, and, on November 18, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Western Digital Corporation Non-Employee Directors Stock-For-Fees Plan (the "Stock-For-Fees Plan"). The amendment eliminated, effective January 1, 2005, the requirement that non-employee directors receive one-half of their director retainer fees in Company stock. Non-employee directors will continue to have the option to elect to receive shares, on a current or deferred basis, in lieu of any or all of the annual retainer fees, chairman fees and/or meeting attendance fees otherwise payable to him or her in cash. The number of shares of common stock payable will continue to be determined by dividing the amount of the cash fee the non-employee director would have received by the fair market value of the common stock on the date the cash fee would have been paid.
     The amendment to the Stock-For-Fees Plan also eliminated, effective January 1, 2005, the requirement that the Company pay non-employee directors a 15% premium on cash retainer fees or cash meeting fees that the director elects to defer under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. Non-employee directors will continue to receive a 25% premium with respect to annual retainer fees or meeting fees that the director elects to defer in the form of deferred shares of Company stock.
     3. The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors recommended, and, on November 18, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved, an amendment to the Western Digital Corporation Non-Employee Directors Restricted Stock Unit Plan to increase the number of restricted stock units granted annually to non-employee directors from 2,100 units to 4,527 units, effective January 1, 2005.
Item 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.
     I.M. Booth retired as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, effective immediately prior to the Company's annual stockholders meeting held on November 18, 2004.

     Shares of Common Stock Subject to the Plan; Share Limits
     
4.1Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, the capital stock that may be delivered under this Plan shall be shares of the Corporation's authorized but unissued Common Stock and any shares of its Common Stock held as treasury shares.

     Shares Available.
"Common Stock"
     
4.2The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted to Eligible Persons under this Plan (the ) is equal to the sum of the following:
     Share Limits.
"Share Limit"
provided that in no event shall the Share Limit exceed 35,199,313 shares (which is the sum of the 4,500,000 shares set forth above, plus the number of shares available under the Option Plans for additional award grant
 
purposes as of the Effective Date (as such term is defined in Section 8.6.1), plus the aggregate number of shares subject to options previously granted and outstanding under the Option Plans as of the Effective Date, plus the maximum number of shares subject to restricted stock awards previously granted and outstanding under the Broad-Based Plan that had not vested as of the Effective Date).
     
Shares issued in respect of any "Full-Value Award" granted under this Plan shall be counted against the foregoing Share Limit as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. (For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of Common Stock is granted under this Plan, 135 shares shall be charged against the Share Limit in connection with that award.) For this purpose, a "Full-Value Award" means any award under this Plan that is not either: (1) a delivery of shares in respect of compensation earned but deferred, (2) except as expressly provided in Section 5.1.1 (which generally provides that "discounted" stock option grants are Full-Value Awards), a stock option grant, and (3) except as expressly provided in Section 5.1.2 (which generally provides that "discounted" stock appreciation right grants are Full-Value Awards), a stock appreciation right grant.
     
The following limits also apply with respect to awards granted under this Plan:
     
Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.

4.4 The Corporation shall at all times reserve a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to cover the Corporation's obligations and contingent obligations to deliver shares with respect to awards then outstanding under this Plan (exclusive of any dividend equivalent obligations to the extent the Corporation has the right to settle such rights in cash). No fractional
     Reservation of Shares; No Fractional Shares; Minimum Issue.
 
shares shall be delivered under this Plan. The Administrator may pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares in settlements of awards under this Plan.
          5.     
Awards
     
5.1The Administrator shall determine the type or types of award(s) to be made to each selected Eligible Person. Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem. Awards also may be made in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, as alternatives to, or as the payment form for grants or rights under any other employee or compensation plan of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under this Plan are:

5.2Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any of the types of awards listed in Section 5.1.4 above may be, and options and SARs granted with an exercise or base price not less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock at the date of grant (and respectively) typically will be, granted as awards intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (). The grant, vesting, exercisability or payment of Performance-Based Awards may depend (or, in the case of Qualifying Options or Qualifying SARs, may also depend) on the degree of achievement of one or more performance goals relative to a pre-established targeted level or level using one or more of the Business Criteria set forth below (on an absolute or relative basis) for the Corporation on a consolidated basis or for one or more of the Corporation's subsidiaries, segments, divisions or business units, or any combination of the foregoing. Any Qualifying Option or Qualifying SAR shall be subject only to the requirements of Section 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 in order for such award to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Award. Any other Performance-Based Award shall be subject to all of the following provisions of this Section 5.2.
     Section 162(m) Performance-Based Awards.
"Qualifying Options"
"Qualifying SARS,"
"Performance-Based Awards"
 
     
5.3Each award shall be evidenced by a written award agreement in the form approved by the Administrator and executed on behalf of the Corporation and, if required by the Administrator, executed by the recipient of the award. The Administrator may authorize any officer of the Corporation (other than the particular award recipient) to execute any or all award agreements on behalf of the Corporation. The award agreement shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the award as established by the Administrator consistent with the express limitations of this Plan.
     Award Agreements.
     
5.4Payment of awards may be in the form of cash, Common Stock, other awards or combinations thereof as the Administrator shall determine, and with such restrictions as it may
     Deferrals and Settlements.
 
impose. The Administrator may also require or permit participants to elect to defer the issuance of shares or the settlement of awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under this Plan. The Administrator may also provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest or other earnings on the deferral amounts, or the payment or crediting of dividend equivalents where the deferred amounts are denominated in shares.
     
5.5The purchase price for any award granted under this Plan or the Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to an award, as applicable, may be paid by means of any lawful consideration as determined by the Administrator, including, without limitation, one or a combination of the following methods:
     Consideration for Common Stock or Awards.
     
In no event shall any shares newly-issued by the Corporation be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration for such shares or for consideration other than consideration permitted by applicable state law. In the event that the Administrator allows a participant to exercise an award by delivering shares of Common Stock previously owned by such participant and unless otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator, any shares delivered which were initially acquired by the participant from the Corporation (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise) must have been owned by the participant at least six months as of the date of delivery. Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an option shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise. The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation.
     
5.6For purposes of this Plan, "fair market value" shall mean, unless otherwise determined or provided by the Administrator in the circumstances, the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the ) for the date in question or, if no sales of Common Stock were made on the Exchange on that date, the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on said composite tape for the next preceding day on which sales of Common Stock were made on the Exchange. The Administrator may, however, provide with respect to one or more awards that the fair market value shall equal the last closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the Exchange available at the relevant time or the average of the high and low trading prices of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the Exchange for the date in question or the most recent trading day. If the Common Stock is no longer listed or is no longer actively traded on the Exchange as of the applicable date, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the award in the circumstances. The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining fair market value with respect to one or more awards if a different methodology is necessary or advisable to secure any intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular award(s) (for example, and without limitation, the Administrator may provide that fair market value for purposes of one or
     Definition of Fair Market Value.
"Exchange"
 
more awards will be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date).
     
5.7
     Transfer Restrictions.
     
5.8One or more awards may be granted to Eligible Persons who provide services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries outside of the United States. Any awards granted to such persons may be granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of any applicable sub-plans, if any, appended to this Plan and approved by the Administrator.
     International Awards.
          6.     
Effect of Termination of Service on Awards
     
6.1The Administrator shall establish the effect of a termination of employment or service on the rights and benefits under each award under this Plan and in so doing may make distinctions based upon, inter alia, the cause of termination and type of award. If the participant is not an employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and provides other services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of this Plan (unless a contract or the award otherwise provides) of whether the participant continues to render services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated.
     General.
     
6.2Unless the express policy of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator, otherwise provides, the employment relationship shall not be considered terminated in the case of (a) sick leave, (b) military leave, or (c) any other leave of absence authorized by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator; provided that unless reemployment upon the expiration of such leave is guaranteed by contract or law, such leave is for a period of not more than 90 days. In the case of any employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on an approved leave of absence, continued vesting of the award while on leave from the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be suspended until the employee returns to service, unless the Administrator
     Events Not Deemed Terminations of Service.
 
otherwise provides or applicable law otherwise requires. In no event shall an award be exercised after the expiration of the term set forth in the award agreement.
     
6.3For purposes of this Plan and any award, if an entity ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Corporation a termination of employment or service shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to each Eligible Person in respect of such Subsidiary who does not continue as an Eligible Person in respect of another entity within the Corporation or another Subsidiary that continues as such after giving effect to the transaction or other event giving rise to the change in status.
     Effect of Change of Subsidiary Status.
          7.     
Adjustments; Acceleration
     
7.1Upon or in contemplation of: any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split ("stock split"); any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock (whether in the form of securities or property); any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock; or a sale of all or substantially all the business or assets of the Corporation as an entirety; then the Administrator shall, in such manner, to such extent (if any) and at such time as it deems appropriate and equitable in the circumstances:
     Adjustments.
     
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award. With respect to any award of an ISO, the Administrator may make such an adjustment that causes the option to cease to qualify as an ISO without the consent of the affected participant.
     
In any of such events, the Administrator may take such action prior to such event to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares in the same manner as is or will be available to stockholders generally. In the case of any stock split or reverse stock split, if no action is taken by the Administrator, the proportionate adjustments contemplated by clause (a) above shall nevertheless be made.
     
7.2Upon a dissolution of the Corporation or other event described in Section 7.1 that the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock), then each then-outstanding option and SAR shall become fully vested, all shares of restricted stock then outstanding shall fully vest free of restrictions, and each other award granted under this Plan that is then outstanding shall become payable to the holder of such award; provided that such acceleration provision shall not apply, unless otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator, with respect to any award to the extent that the Administrator has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the award, or the award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms, in the circumstances.
     Automatic Acceleration of Awards.
 
     
7.3Without limiting Section 7.2, in the event of a Change in Control Event (as defined below), the Administrator may, in its discretion, provide that any outstanding option or SAR shall become fully vested, that any share of restricted stock then outstanding shall fully vest free of restrictions, and that any other award granted under this Plan that is then outstanding shall be payable to the holder of such award. The Administrator may take such action with respect to all awards then outstanding or only with respect to certain specific awards identified by the Administrator in the circumstances and may condition any such acceleration upon the occurrence of another event (such as, without limitation, a termination of the award holder's employment). For purposes of this Plan, means any of the following:
     Possible Acceleration of Awards.
"Change in Control Event"
 
     
7.4Any award that has been accelerated as required or contemplated by Section 7.2 or 7.3 (or would have been so accelerated but for Section 7.5, 7.6 or 7.7) shall terminate upon the related event referred to in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as applicable, subject to any provision that has been expressly made by the Administrator, through a plan of reorganization or otherwise, for the survival, substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of such award and provided that, in the case of options and SARs that will not survive, be substituted for, assumed, exchanged, or otherwise continued or settled in the transaction, the holder of such award shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding options and SARs in accordance with their terms (subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting) before the termination of such awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of accelerated vesting and the impending termination be required and any acceleration may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event).
     Early Termination of Awards.
     
7.5Any acceleration of awards pursuant to this Section 7 shall comply with applicable legal requirements and, if necessary to accomplish the purposes of the acceleration or if the circumstances require, may be deemed by the Administrator to occur a limited period of time not greater than 30 days before the event. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator may deem an acceleration to occur immediately prior to the applicable event and/or reinstate the original terms of an award if an event giving rise to an acceleration does not occur. The Administrator may override the provisions of Section 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and/or 7.6 by express provision in the award agreement and may accord any Eligible Person a right to refuse any acceleration, whether pursuant to the award agreement or otherwise, in such circumstances as the Administrator may approve. The portion of any ISO accelerated in connection with a Change in Control Event or any other action permitted hereunder shall remain exercisable as an ISO only to the extent the applicable $100,000 limitation on ISOs is not exceeded. To the extent exceeded, the accelerated portion of the option shall be exercisable as a nonqualified stock option under the Code.
     Other Acceleration Rules.
     
7.6If the vesting of an award has been accelerated expressly in anticipation of an event or upon stockholder approval of an event and the Administrator later determines that the event will not occur, the Administrator may rescind the effect of the acceleration as to any then outstanding and unexercised or otherwise unvested awards.
     Possible Rescission of Acceleration.
     
7.7Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section 7 to the contrary, in no event shall an award be accelerated under this Plan to an extent or in a manner which would not be fully deductible by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Code, nor shall any payment hereunder be accelerated to the extent any portion of such accelerated payment would not be deductible by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries because of Section 280G of the Code. If a participant would be entitled to benefits or payments hereunder and under any other plan or program that would constitute "parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code, then the participant may by written notice to the Corporation designate the order in which such parachute payments will be reduced or modified so that the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries is not denied federal income tax deductions for any "parachute payments" because of Section 280G of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a participant is a party to an employment or other agreement with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or is a participant in a severance program sponsored by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, that contains express provisions regarding Section 280G and/or Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar successor provision), the Section 280G and/or Section 4999 provisions of such employment or other agreement or plan, as applicable, shall control as to any awards held by that participant (for example, and without limitation, a participant may be a party to an employment agreement with the Corporation or one
     Golden Parachute Limitation.
 
of its Subsidiaries that provides for a "gross-up" as opposed to a "cut-back" in the event that the Section 280G thresholds are reached or exceeded in connection with a change in control and, in such event, the Section 280G and/or Section 4999 provisions of such employment agreement shall control as to any awards held by that participant).
          8.     
Other Provisions
     
8.1This Plan, the granting and vesting of awards under this Plan, the offer, issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock, the acceptance of promissory notes and/or the payment of money under this Plan or under awards are subject to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal securities law, federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The person acquiring any securities under this Plan will, if requested by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.
     Compliance with Laws.
     
8.2No person shall have any claim or rights to be granted an award (or additional awards, as the case may be) under this Plan, subject to any express contractual rights (set forth in a document other than this Plan) to the contrary.
     Employment Status.
     
8.3Nothing contained in this Plan (or in any other documents under this Plan or in any award) shall confer upon any Eligible Person or other participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, constitute any contract or agreement of employment or other service or affect an employee's status as an employee at will, nor shall interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to change a person's compensation or other benefits, or to terminate his or her employment or other service, with or without cause. Nothing in this Section 8.3, however, is intended to adversely affect any express independent right of such person under a separate employment or service contract other than an award agreement.
     No Employment/Service Contract.
     
8.4Awards payable under this Plan shall be payable in shares or from the general assets of the Corporation, and no special or separate reserve, fund or deposit shall be made to assure payment of such awards. No participant, beneficiary or other person shall have any right, title or interest in any fund or in any specific asset (including shares of Common Stock, except as expressly otherwise provided) of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries by reason of any award hereunder. Neither the provisions of this Plan (or of any related documents), nor the creation or adoption of this Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and any participant, beneficiary or other person. To the extent that a participant, beneficiary or other person acquires a right to receive payment pursuant to any award hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.
     Plan Not Funded.
     
8.5Upon any exercise, vesting, or payment of any award or upon the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO prior to satisfaction of the holding period requirements of Section 422 of the Code, the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall have the right at its option to:
     Tax Withholding.
     
In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) grant (either at the
 
time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, to have the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law. The Corporation may, with the Administrator's approval, accept one or more promissory notes from any Eligible Person in connection with taxes required to be withheld upon the exercise, vesting or payment of any award under this Plan; provided that any such note shall be subject to terms and conditions established by the Administrator and the requirements of applicable law.
     
8.6
     Effective Date, Termination and Suspension, Amendments.
     
8.7Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Administrator or this Plan, a participant shall not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership as to any shares of Common Stock not actually delivered to and held of record by the participant. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a stockholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.
     Privileges of Stock Ownership.

8.10Awards may be granted to Eligible Persons in substitution for or in connection with an assumption of employee stock options, SARs, restricted stock or other stock-based awards granted by other entities to persons who are or who will become Eligible Persons in respect of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, in connection with a distribution, merger or other reorganization by or with the granting entity or an affiliated entity, or the acquisition by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial part of the stock or assets of the employing entity. The awards so granted need not comply with other specific terms of this Plan, provided the awards reflect only adjustments giving effect to the assumption or substitution consistent with the conversion applicable to the Common Stock in the transaction and any change in the issuer of the security. Any shares that are delivered and any awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Corporation, as a result of the assumption by the Corporation of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company (or previously granted by a predecessor employer (or direct or indirect parent thereof) in the case of persons that become employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries in connection with a business or asset acquisition or similar transaction) shall not be counted against the Share Limit or other limits on the number of shares available for issuance under this Plan.
     Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Stock Options or Awards Granted by Other Corporation.
     
8.11Nothing in this Plan shall limit or be deemed to limit the authority of the Board or the Administrator to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without reference to the Common Stock, under any other plan or authority.
     Non-Exclusivity of Plan.
 
     
8.12The existence of this Plan, the award agreements and the awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation to make or authorize: (a) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the capital structure or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (b) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (c) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (d) any dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (e) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or (f) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Corporation or any Subsidiary. No participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim under any award or award agreement against any member of the Board or the Administrator, or the Corporation or any employees, officers or agents of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action.
     No Corporate Action Restriction.
     
8.13Payments and other benefits received by a participant under an award made pursuant to this Plan shall not be deemed a part of a participant's compensation for purposes of the determination of benefits under any other employee welfare or benefit plans or arrangements, if any, provided by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, except where the Administrator expressly otherwise provides or authorizes in writing. Awards under this Plan may be made in addition to, in combination with, as alternatives to or in payment of grants, awards or commitments under any other plans or arrangements of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

[WESTERN DIGITAL LOGO] Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Telephone 949 672-7000 STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS 2004 Performance Incentive Plan 1. OPTION SUBJECT TO 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN. The option (the "Option") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement (the "Notice") was issued under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Stock Options (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The holder of the Option is referred to herein as the "Participant." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of these Standard Terms, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan after the grant date of the Option. 2. OPTION AGREEMENT. The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. TYPE OF STOCK OPTION The Notice indicates whether the Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option (an "ISO") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or is a nonqualified stock option (an option that is not an ISO). ISOs are subject to additional requirements under the Code as generally described in Section 5.1 of the Plan. If the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs (whether granted under the Option or otherwise) first become exercisable by the Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, as measured on the applicable option grant dates and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the limitations of Section 5.1.2 of the Plan shall apply and to such extent the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. 4. VESTING The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in the Notice. [STANDARD VESTING - INCLUDE UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE TIME OF GRANT OF THE AWARD: The first vesting installment of the Option shall be a fixed installment covering the number of shares, and vesting on the fixed vesting date, set forth in the first line of the Notice under "Vesting." The balance of the Option (identified as "Quarterly" vesting in the Notice) shall vest and
become exercisable in substantially equal quarterly installments over the three year period following the first anniversary of the grant date of the Option (such that the first quarterly installment shall vest on the date that is three months after the first vesting date of the Option and so on such that all quarterly installments are scheduled to have vested on or before the Quarterly "Full Vesting" vesting date set forth in the Notice).] In each case, the Option is subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5. The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 6 below or under the Plan. 5. EXPIRATION OF OPTION The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 6 below, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, TOTAL DISABILITY OR DEATH The Option shall be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her permitted successor in interest) following the Participant's termination of employment only to the extent provided below in this Section 6. Except as provided in Section 6(f) below, the last day that the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to a period of non-employment by any such entity is referred to as the Participant's "Severance Date." In each case described below, the Option shall be subject to earlier termination as contemplated by Section 5. (a) Termination of Employment Generally. In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason (other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause (as defined below), due to the Participant's death or Retirement (as defined below), or at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled (as defined below)), the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date and, to the extent that the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three months following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-month period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-month period. (b) Total Disability. In the event that the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled and is not eligible to Retire, the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date. In such circumstances, or in the event that the Participant incurs such a Total Disability within not more than three months of the Participant's Severance Date if the termination of the Participant's employment was for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option may, to the extent the Option was exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, be exercised by the Participant (or, if the Participant is then incapacitated, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs, or legatees) at any time during the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period. For purposes of the Option, "Total 2
Disability" (which term shall include "Totally Disabled") means a "permanent and total disability" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code. (c) Death. If the Participant dies while he or she is an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable, at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. (d) Retirement. If the Participant Retires from the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant (or if the Participant is then deceased, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable) at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Retired Participant provides services to a competitor of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, consultant, director, officer, representative, independent contractor or otherwise, or otherwise competes with the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (in each case as determined by the Administrator its sole discretion), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall immediately terminate. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Participant as a result of any exercise of the Option during the six-month period prior to the date such Retired Participant commenced providing such services to a competitor. For this purpose, the Participant shall be deemed to have "Retired" (which term shall include "Retirement," "Retire" and "Retires") if the Participant voluntarily retires from employment with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries after satisfying all of the following at the time of such retirement: (i) the Participant is at least 55 years of age, (ii) the Participant's age plus total years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) totals at least 65, and (iii) the Participant has five (5) or more years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) ending on the date of such retirement. For purposes of calculating "age plus total years of continuous service" under clause (ii) above, fractional years shall be disregarded but may be cumulated (so that, by way of example only, a Participant who is age 55 and 6 months with 9 years and 6 months of continuous service would satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), while a Participant who is age 55 and 6 months with 9 years and 5 months of continuous service would not satisfy the requirements of clause (ii)). For purposes of calculating the Participant's "years of continuous service" under clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, in no event shall the Participant accrue more than one year of service with respect to any period of twelve consecutive months (that is, concurrent employment by both the Corporation and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by multiple Subsidiaries, for a month shall not be counted as more than one month of service). (e) Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, if the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option (whether or not all or any portion of such Option is then vested and exercisable) shall immediately terminate on the Participant's Severance Date. For these purposes, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by the Administrator or its delegate or delegates in its or their sole discretion: (i) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved; (ii) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions; (iii) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer; 3
(iv) negligence, insubordination, violation by the Participant of any duty (loyalty or otherwise) owed to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other misconduct on the part of the Participant; (v) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Administrator's (or its delegate's or delegates') reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (vi) sexual harassment by the Participant that has been reasonably substantiated and investigated; (vii) involvement in activities representing conflicts of interest with the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (viii) improper disclosure of confidential information; (ix) conduct endangering, or likely to endanger, the health or safety of another employee; (x) falsifying or misrepresenting information on the records of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (xi) the Participant's physical destruction or theft of substantial property or assets of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (xii) breach of any policy of, or agreement with, the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates applicable to the Participant or to which the Participant is otherwise bound. (f) Continuation of Services. If the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries terminates (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, the Participant continues to render services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, director or consultant, such Participant's Severance Date for purposes of the Option shall not be the date such Participant's employment terminates, but instead shall be the last day that the Participant either is employed by or actually renders services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. As provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of the Option of whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated. (g) Exercise Period for ISOs. Notwithstanding any post-termination exercise period provided for herein or in the Plan, the Option will qualify as an ISO only if it is exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs under, and meets all of the other requirements of, the Code. If the Option is not exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs or does not meet such other requirements, the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. 7. EXERCISE OF OPTION The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of: - a written notice stating the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the Option or by the completion of such other administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may require from time to time, 4
- payment in full for the purchase price (the per-share exercise price of the Option multiplied by the number of shares to be purchased) in cash, check or by electronic funds transfer to the Corporation, or (subject to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing requirements and further subject to such rules as the Administrator may adopt as to any non-cash payment) in shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant, valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, provided, however, that any shares initially acquired upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise from the Corporation must have been owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months before the date of such exercise; - any written statements or agreements required by the Administrator pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan; and - satisfaction of the tax withholding provisions of Section 8.5 of the Plan. The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator. The Option will qualify as an ISO only if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Code. 8. NONTRANSFERABILITY The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan. 9. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 10. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof. 11. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to 5
have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11. 12. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Option or the Participant's employment, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Option Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute.

[WESTERN DIGITAL LOGO] Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Telephone 949 672-7000 STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS - EXECUTIVES 2004 Performance Incentive Plan 1. OPTION SUBJECT TO 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN. The option (the "Option") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement (the "Notice") was issued under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Stock Options - Executives (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The holder of the Option is referred to herein as the "Participant." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of these Standard Terms, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan after the grant date of the Option. 2. OPTION AGREEMENT. The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. TYPE OF STOCK OPTION The Notice indicates whether the Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option (an "ISO") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or is a nonqualified stock option (an option that is not an ISO). ISOs are subject to additional requirements under the Code as generally described in Section 5.1 of the Plan. If the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs (whether granted under the Option or otherwise) first become exercisable by the Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, as measured on the applicable option grant dates and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the limitations of Section 5.1.2 of the Plan shall apply and to such extent the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. 4. VESTING The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in the Notice. [STANDARD VESTING - INCLUDE UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE TIME OF GRANT OF THE AWARD: The first vesting installment of the Option shall be a fixed installment covering the number of shares, and vesting on the fixed vesting date, set forth in the first line of the Notice under "Vesting." The balance of the Option (identified as "Quarterly" vesting in the Notice) shall vest and
become exercisable in substantially equal quarterly installments over the three year period following the first anniversary of the grant date of the Option (such that the first quarterly installment shall vest on the date that is three months after the first vesting date of the Option and so on such that all quarterly installments are scheduled to have vested on or before the Quarterly "Full Vesting" vesting date set forth in the Notice).] In each case, the Option is subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, to the extent that the Option is outstanding and otherwise unvested immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Option shall vest and become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Change in Control Event. This acceleration provision shall not in any way limit the Corporation's ability to terminate the Option in connection with a Change in Control Event as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan; provided that, in any such circumstances, the Optionee is given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise the outstanding portion of the Option in accordance with its terms (subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting) before the termination of the Option in such circumstances (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of accelerated vesting and the impending termination be required and any acceleration may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event). The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 6 below or under the Plan. 5. EXPIRATION OF OPTION The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 6 below, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, TOTAL DISABILITY OR DEATH The Option shall be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her permitted successor in interest) following the Participant's termination of employment only to the extent provided below in this Section 6. Except as provided in Section 6(f) below, the last day that the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to a period of non-employment by any such entity is referred to as the Participant's "Severance Date." In each case described below, the Option shall be subject to earlier termination as contemplated by Section 5. (a) Termination of Employment Generally. In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason (other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause (as defined below), due to the Participant's death or Retirement (as defined below), or at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled (as defined below)), the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date and, to the extent that the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three months following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-month period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-month period. 2
(b) Total Disability. In the event that the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled and is not eligible to Retire, the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date. In such circumstances, or in the event that the Participant incurs such a Total Disability within not more than three months of the Participant's Severance Date if the termination of the Participant's employment was for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option may, to the extent the Option was exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, be exercised by the Participant (or, if the Participant is then incapacitated, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs, or legatees) at any time during the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period. For purposes of the Option, "Total Disability" (which term shall include "Totally Disabled") means a "permanent and total disability" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code. (c) Death. If the Participant dies while he or she is an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable, at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. (d) Retirement. If the Participant Retires from the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant (or if the Participant is then deceased, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable) at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Retired Participant provides services to a competitor of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, consultant, director, officer, representative, independent contractor or otherwise, or otherwise competes with the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (in each case as determined by the Administrator its sole discretion), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall immediately terminate. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Participant as a result of any exercise of the Option during the six-month period prior to the date such Retired Participant commenced providing such services to a competitor. For this purpose, the Participant shall be deemed to have "Retired" (which term shall include "Retirement," "Retire" and "Retires") if the Participant voluntarily retires from employment with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries after satisfying all of the following at the time of such retirement: (i) the Participant is at least 55 years of age, (ii) the Participant's age plus total years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) totals at least 65, and (iii) the Participant has five (5) or more years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) ending on the date of such retirement. For purposes of calculating "age plus total years of continuous service" under clause (ii) above, fractional years shall be disregarded but may be cumulated (so that, by way of example only, a Participant who is age 55 and 6 months with 9 years and 6 months of continuous service would satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), while a Participant who is age 55 and 6 months with 9 years and 5 months of continuous service would not satisfy the requirements of clause (ii)). For purposes of calculating the Participant's "years of continuous service" under clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, in no event shall the Participant accrue more than one year of service with respect to any period of twelve consecutive months (that is, concurrent employment by both the Corporation and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by multiple Subsidiaries, for a month shall not be counted as more than one month of service). (e) Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, if the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option (whether or not all or any portion of such Option is then vested and exercisable) shall immediately terminate on the Participant's Severance Date. 3
For purposes of this Section 6 and as to any termination of employment or services that occurs prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by the Administrator or its delegate or delegates in its or their sole discretion: (i) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved; (ii) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions; (iii) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer; (iv) negligence, insubordination, violation by the Participant of any duty (loyalty or otherwise) owed to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other misconduct on the part of the Participant; (v) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Administrator's (or its delegate's or delegates') reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (vi) sexual harassment by the Participant that has been reasonably substantiated and investigated; (vii) involvement in activities representing conflicts of interest with the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (viii) improper disclosure of confidential information; (ix) conduct endangering, or likely to endanger, the health or safety of another employee; (x) falsifying or misrepresenting information on the records of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (xi) the Participant's physical destruction or theft of substantial property or assets of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (xii) breach of any policy of, or agreement with, the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates applicable to the Participant or to which the Participant is otherwise bound. For purposes of this Section 6 and as to any termination of employment or services that occurs after the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board: (A) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved; (B) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions which results directly or indirectly in any demonstrable material financial or economic harm to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; 4
(C) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer, provided that the Participant shall have first received written notice from the employer stating with specificity the nature of such failure or refusal and affording the Participant at least five (5) days to correct the act or omission complained of; (D) gross negligence, insubordination, material violation by the Participant of any duty of loyalty to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other material misconduct on the part of the Participant, provided that the Participant shall have first received written notice from the Corporation stating with specificity the nature of such action or violation and affording the Participant at least five (5) days to correct such action or violation; (E) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Board's reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (F) sexual harassment by the Participant that has been reasonably substantiated and investigated; (G) involvement in activities representing conflicts of interest with the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; (H) improper disclosure of confidential information; (I) conduct endangering, or likely to endanger, the health or safety of another employee; (J) falsifying or misrepresenting information on the records of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates; or (K) the Participant's physical destruction or theft of substantial property or assets of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates. (f) Continuation of Services. If the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries terminates (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, the Participant continues to render services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, director or consultant, such Participant's Severance Date for purposes of the Option shall not be the date such Participant's employment terminates, but instead shall be the last day that the Participant either is employed by or actually renders services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. As provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of the Option of whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated. (g) Exercise Period for ISOs. Notwithstanding any post-termination exercise period provided for herein or in the Plan, the Option will qualify as an ISO only if it is exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs under, and meets all of the other requirements of, the Code. If the Option is not exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs or does not meet such other requirements, the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. 7. EXERCISE OF OPTION The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of: 5
- a written notice stating the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the Option or by the completion of such other administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may require from time to time, - payment in full for the purchase price (the per-share exercise price of the Option multiplied by the number of shares to be purchased) in cash, check or by electronic funds transfer to the Corporation, or (subject to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing requirements and further subject to such rules as the Administrator may adopt as to any non-cash payment) in shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant, valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, provided, however, that any shares initially acquired upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise from the Corporation must have been owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months before the date of such exercise; - any written statements or agreements required by the Administrator pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan; and - satisfaction of the tax withholding provisions of Section 8.5 of the Plan. The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator. The Option will qualify as an ISO only if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Code. 8. NONTRANSFERABILITY The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan. 9. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 10. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof. 11. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed 6
as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11. 12.

Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Option, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 12). 13. GOVERNING LAW This Option Agreement, including these Standard Terms, shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law. 14. SEVERABILITY If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Option Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Option Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder. 7
15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof. 16. SECTION HEADINGS The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof. 8

Promptly after the vesting of any Restricted Shares pursuant to the Notice, the Corporation shall, as applicable, either remove the notations on any Restricted Shares issued in book entry form which have vested or deliver to the Participant a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of Restricted Shares which have vested (or, in either case, such lesser number of shares as may be permitted pursuant to Section 8.5 of the Plan). The Participant (or the beneficiary or personal representative of the Participant in the event of the Participant's death or incapacity, as the case may be) shall deliver to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan. The shares so delivered shall no longer be restricted shares hereunder. (d) Stock Power; Power of Attorney. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Award Agreement, the Participant shall deliver to the Corporation an executed stock power in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, in blank, with respect to such shares. The Participant, by acceptance of the Award, shall be deemed to appoint, and does so appoint by execution of this Award Agreement, the Corporation and each of its authorized representatives as the Participant's attorney(s)-in-fact to effect any transfer of unvested forfeited shares (or shares otherwise reacquired by the Corporation hereunder) to the Corporation as may be required pursuant to the Plan or this Award Agreement and to execute such documents as the Corporation or such representatives deem necessary or advisable in connection with any such transfer. 5. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Subject to earlier vesting as provided in Section 7.2 or 7.3 of the Plan and Section 6 hereof, if the Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or due to disability), the Participant's Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) shall be forfeited to the Corporation to the extent such shares have not become vested upon the date the Participant's employment or services terminate; provided, however, that in the event of the Participant's death at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) covered by the next installment of the Award scheduled to vest following the date of the Participant's death pursuant to the Notice and Section 3 hereof shall automatically become fully vested as of such date of death, and the Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) covered by any remaining installments of the Award that have not vested after giving effect to the foregoing proviso shall be forfeited to the Corporation as of such date of death. Upon the occurrence of any forfeiture of Restricted Shares hereunder, such unvested, forfeited shares and related Restricted Property shall be automatically transferred to the Corporation, without any other action by the Participant (or the Participant's successor or representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable) and, if applicable, the Corporation shall refund any purchase price paid by the Participant for such forfeited shares to the Participant (or the Participant's successor or representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable); no additional consideration shall be paid by the Corporation with respect to such transfer. No interest shall be credited with respect to nor shall any other adjustments be made to the purchase price for fluctuations in the fair market value of the Common Stock either before or after the transfer date (except for customary adjustments to reflect stock splits, reverse stock splits, and stock dividends). The Corporation may exercise its powers under Section 4(d) hereof and take any other action necessary or advisable to evidence such transfer. The Participant (or the Participant's successor or representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable) shall deliver any additional documents of transfer that the Corporation may request to confirm the transfer of such unvested, forfeited shares and related Restricted Property to the Corporation. 2
6. ADJUSTMENTS Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Corporation's stock contemplated by Section 7.1 of the Plan, the Administrator will make adjustments if appropriate in the number and kind of securities that may become vested under the Award. If any adjustment is made under Section 7.1 of the Plan, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Shares shall continue in effect with respect to any consideration or other securities (the "RESTRICTED PROPERTY" and, for the purposes of this Award Agreement, "Restricted Shares" shall include "Restricted Property," unless the context otherwise requires) received in respect of such Restricted Shares. Such Restricted Property shall vest at such times and in such proportion as the Restricted Shares to which the Restricted Property is attributable vest, or would have vested pursuant to the terms hereof if such Restricted Shares had remained outstanding. To the extent that the Restricted Property includes any cash (other than regular cash dividends provided for in Section 10 hereof), such cash shall be invested, pursuant to policies established by the Administrator, in interest bearing, FDIC-insured (subject to applicable insurance limits) deposits of a depository institution selected by the Administrator, the earnings on which shall be added to and become a part of the Restricted Property. 7. WITHHOLDING TAXES The Corporation (or any of its Subsidiaries last employing the Participant) shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from other compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the vesting of any Restricted Shares. Alternatively, the Participant or other person in whom the Restricted Shares vest may irrevocably elect, in such manner and at such time or times prior to any applicable tax date as may be permitted or required under Section 8.5 of the Plan and rules established by the Administrator, to have the Corporation (or the entity last employing the Participant) withhold and reacquire Restricted Shares at their fair market value at the time of vesting to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to such vesting. Any election to have shares so held back and reacquired shall be subject to such rules and procedures, which may include prior approval of the Administrator, as the Administrator may impose from time to time, and shall not be available if the Participant makes or has made an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Award. 8. NONTRANSFERABILITY Prior to the time that they have become vested pursuant to the Notice and Section 3, neither the Restricted Shares, nor any interest therein, amount payable in respect thereof, or Restricted Property (as defined in Section 6 hereof) may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 9. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 10. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Notice and these Standard Terms, the Participant shall have all of the powers, preferences, and rights of a holder of Common Stock with respect to the Restricted Shares. The Participant agrees and understands that nothing contained in these Standard Terms provides, or is intended to provide, any protection against potential future dilution of his or her stockholder interest in the Corporation for any reason. After the grant date of the Award, the Participant shall be entitled to cash dividends and voting rights with respect to the Restricted Shares subject to the Award even though such shares are not vested, provided that such rights shall terminate immediately as to any Restricted Shares that are forfeited pursuant to Section 5. Any stock dividends paid 3
in respect of Restricted Shares shall be treated as additional Restricted Shares and shall be subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions that apply to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such stock dividends are paid. 11. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11. 12. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Award Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy arising out of or related to the Award, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Award Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Award, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 12). 13. GOVERNING LAW This Award Agreement, including these Standard Terms, shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law. 14. SEVERABILITY If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Award Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Award Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Award Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that 4
any order striking any portion of this Award Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder. 15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Award Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof. 16. SECTION HEADINGS The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof. 5

The restricted shares covered by the Award (the "Restricted Shares") are subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Restricted Stock Awards - Executives (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control.

AWARD AGREEMENT The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Award Agreement with respect to the Award pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3.

The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 5 below or under the Plan. 1
4. STOCK CERTIFICATES (a) Book Entry Form. The Corporation shall issue the Restricted Shares subject to the Award either: (a) in certificate form as provided in Section 4(b) below; or (b) in book entry form, registered in the name of the Participant with notations regarding the applicable restrictions on transfer imposed under this Award Agreement. (b) Certificates to be Held by Corporation; Legend.

Such certificates shall bear the following legend: "The ownership of this certificate and the shares of stock evidenced hereby and any interest therein are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer under an Agreement entered into between the registered owner and Western Digital Corporation.

Promptly after the vesting of any Restricted Shares pursuant to the Notice, the Corporation shall, as applicable, either remove the notations on any Restricted Shares issued in book entry form which have vested or deliver to the Participant a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of Restricted Shares which have vested (or, in either case, such lesser number of shares as may be permitted pursuant to Section 8.5 of the Plan). The Participant (or the beneficiary or personal representative of the Participant in the event of the Participant's death or incapacity, as the case may be) shall deliver to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Subject to earlier vesting as provided in Section 7.2 or 7.3 of the Plan and Section 6 hereof, if the Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or due to disability), the Participant's Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) shall be forfeited to the Corporation to the extent such shares have not become vested upon the date the Participant's employment or services terminate; provided, however, that in the event of the Participant's death at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) covered by the next installment of the Award scheduled to vest following the date of the Participant's death pursuant to the Notice and Section 3 hereof shall automatically become fully vested as of such date of death, and the Restricted Shares (and related Restricted Property) covered by any remaining installments of the Award that have not vested after giving effect to the foregoing proviso shall be forfeited to the Corporation as of such date of death. Upon the occurrence of any forfeiture of Restricted Shares hereunder, such unvested, forfeited shares and related Restricted Property shall be automatically transferred to the Corporation, without any other action by the Participant (or the Participant's successor or representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable) and, if applicable, the Corporation shall refund any purchase price paid by the Participant for such forfeited shares to the Participant (or the Participant's successor or representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable); no additional consideration shall be paid by the Corporation with respect to such transfer.

Alternatively, the Participant or other person in whom the Restricted Shares vest may irrevocably elect, in such manner and at such time or times prior to any applicable tax date as may be permitted or required under Section 8.5 of the Plan and rules established by the Administrator, to have the Corporation (or the entity last employing the Participant) withhold and reacquire Restricted Shares at their fair market value at the time of vesting to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to such vesting.

An individual who was previously a member of the Board, who then ceased to be a member of the Board for any reason, and who then again becomes a Non-Employee Director shall thereupon again become eligible to be granted stock options under this Section 3.2. 3.3 OPTION PRICE. The purchase price per share of the Common Stock covered by each option granted pursuant to this Section 3 shall be 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the option (the "AWARD DATE"). The exercise price of any option granted under this Section 3 shall be paid in full at the time of each purchase in cash or by check, in shares of Common Stock valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise of the option, or partly in such shares and partly in cash, or in any other manner authorized by the Administrator pursuant to Section 5.5 of the Plan; provided that any shares used in payment shall have been owned by the Non-Employee Director for at least six months prior to the date of exercise. 1
3.4 TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. Options granted pursuant to this Section 3 shall be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not approved any transfer exceptions with respect to the options in accordance with Section 5.7.2 of the Plan. 4. OPTION PERIOD AND EXERCISABILITY. Each option granted under Section 3 above and all rights or obligations under this Program with respect to a particular option shall expire ten years after the date of grant of such option and shall be subject to earlier termination as provided below. Subject to Sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof, each option granted under Section 3 shall become exercisable as to 25% of the total number of shares subject thereto on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the option and as to an additional 6.25% of the total number of shares subject thereto at the end of each of the next 12 three-month periods thereafter. 5. TERMINATION OF DIRECTORSHIP. Subject to the maximum ten-year term of the option and subject to earlier termination pursuant to Section 7 below, if a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason, the following rules shall apply with respect to any option granted to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 3 above (the last day that the Director is a member of the Board is, except as otherwise provided below, referred to as the Director's "SEVERANCE DATE"): - other than as expressly provided below in this Section 5, (a) the Non-Employee Director will have until the date that is one (1) year after his or her Severance Date to exercise such option (or portion thereof) to the extent that it was vested on the Severance Date, (b) such option, to the extent not vested on the Severance Date, shall terminate on the Severance Date, and (c) such option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period; - if the Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board due to his or her Retirement (as defined below), (a) the Non-Employee Director will have until the date that is three (3) years after his or her Severance Date to exercise such option, (b) such option, to the extent not otherwise vested on the Severance Date, shall automatically become fully vested as of the Severance Date, and (c) such option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period; provided, however, that if the Board determines that any such Non-Employee Director who has Retired renders services as an employee, director, consultant, contractor or otherwise to a competitor of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries at any time during such three-year period, then any such option shall immediately terminate to the extent not exercised as of the date the Board makes such determination. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Non-Employee Director as a result of any exercise of such option during the six-month period prior to the date such Non-Employee Director commenced providing such services to a competitor. 2
For purposes of this Section 5, the term "RETIREMENT" (which term shall include "Retired") shall mean the cessation of a director's services as a member of the Board due to his or her voluntary resignation at any time after such director has served as a member of the Board for at least forty-eight (48) months and has attained at least age 55. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, if a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, is employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, such director's Severance Date shall not be the date the director ceases to be a member of the Board but instead shall be the last day that the director is either or both (1) a member of the Board and/or (2) employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary. 6. ADJUSTMENTS. Options granted under this Program shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, but only to the extent that such adjustment is consistent with adjustments to options held by persons other than executive officers or directors of the Corporation (to the extent that persons other than executive officers or directors of the Corporation then hold options). The grant levels reflected in Section 3 above shall be automatically adjusted upon the record date for any stock split, reverse stock split, or stock dividend to give effect to such change in capitalization unless otherwise provided by the Board in the circumstances, and may be adjusted in the discretion of the Board in any other circumstances contemplated by Section 7.1. 7. ACCELERATION AND POSSIBLE EARLY TERMINATION. If a Change in Control Event (as such term is defined in the Plan) occurs and in connection with such Change in Control Event a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board, each option granted under Section 3 above to such Non-Employee Director, to the extent such option is then outstanding, shall become immediately exercisable and vested in full. For purposes of this Section 7, but without limitation, a director will be deemed to have ceased to be a member of the Board in connection with a Change in Control Event if such director (a) is removed by or resigns upon the request of any Person exercising practical voting control over the Corporation following such Change in Control Event or a person acting upon authority or at the instruction of such Person, or (b) is willing or able to continue as a member of the Board but is not re-elected to or retained as a member of the Board by the Corporation's stockholders at the stockholder vote or consent action for the election of directors that precedes and is taken in connection with, or next follows, such Change in Control Event. Each option granted under this Program shall be subject to adjustment and termination pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan. 8. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES; AMENDMENT; ADMINISTRATION. If option grants otherwise required pursuant to this Program would otherwise exceed any applicable share limit under Section 4.2 of the Plan, such grants shall be made pro-rata to directors entitled to such grants. The Board may from time to time amend this Program without stockholder approval; provided that no such amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of a Non-Employee Director as to an option granted under this Program before the adoption of such amendment. This Program does not limit the Board's authority to make other, discretionary award grants to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator's power 3
and authority to construe and interpret the Plan and awards thereunder pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Plan shall extend to this Program and awards granted hereunder. As provided in Section 3.2 of the Plan, any action taken by, or inaction of, the Administrator relating or pursuant to this Program and within its authority or under applicable law shall be within the absolute discretion of that entity or body and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons. 4

1. OPTION SUBJECT TO 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN. The Option was granted pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Option Grant Program (the "Program"), adopted under the Western Digital Corporation 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and conditions of this Notice, the Program and the Plan. By accepting the Option, you are agreeing to the terms of the Option as set forth in these documents. A copy of each of these documents has been provided to you. If you need another copy of any of these documents, or if you would like to confirm that you have the most recent version, you may obtain another copy in the Company Library on the E*TRADE OptionsLink web site. The documents are also available on the Western Digital Intranet site under Legal. You should read the Program, the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan and this Notice. The Program and the Plan are each incorporated into (made a part of) this Notice by this reference. To the extent any information in this Notice, the Prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Program and/or the Plan, the Program or the Plan, as applicable, shall control. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. - ------------------- (1) The number of shares subject to the Option and the per-share exercise price of the Option are subject to adjustment under Section 6 of the Program and Section 7.1 of the Plan (for example, and without limitation, in connection with stock splits). (2) The Option is subject to early termination under Sections 5 and 7 of the Program.
You do not have to accept the Option. If you do not agree to the terms of the Option, you should promptly return this Notice to the Western Digital Corporation Stock Plans Administrator. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Notice, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan after the grant date of the Option. 2. OPTION AGREEMENT. This Notice constitutes the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. TYPE OF STOCK OPTION. The Option is not intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 4. VESTING. Subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5, the Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in this Notice and Section 4 of the Program. The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated. The vesting schedule requires continued service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Service for only a portion of the vesting period with respect to a vesting installment, even if services are provided for a substantial portion of that period, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of services as provided under Section 5 of the Program or under the Plan. 5. EXPIRATION OF OPTION. The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option in connection with a termination of the director's services as provided in Section 5 of the Program, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in this Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option. 6. EXERCISE OF OPTION. The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of: - a written notice stating the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the Option or by the completion of such other administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may require from time to time, - payment in full for the purchase price (the per-share exercise price of the Option multiplied by the number of shares to be purchased) in cash, check or by electronic funds transfer to the Corporation, or (subject to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing requirements and further subject to such rules as the Administrator may adopt as to any non-cash payment) in shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant, valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, provided, however, that any shares initially acquired upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise from the Corporation must have been owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months before the date of such exercise; and
- any written statements or agreements required by the Administrator pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan. The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator. 7. NONTRANSFERABILITY. The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement, the Program or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan. 8. NO SERVICE COMMITMENT. Nothing contained in this Option Agreement, the Program or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, confers upon the Participant any right to remain in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 9. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof. 10. NOTICES. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer a member of the Board of Directors, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 10. 11. ARBITRATION. Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Option Agreement, the Program and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Option or the Participant's employment, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as The exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Option Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Option, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 11). 12. GOVERNING LAW. This Option Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law. 13. SEVERABILITY. If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 11 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Option Agreement, the Program or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Option Agreement, the Program or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Option Agreement, the Program and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Option Agreement, the Program and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder. 14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Option Agreement, the Program and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan, the Program and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof. 15. SECTION HEADINGS. The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
     At an investment conference on Wednesday, December 1, Company executives will provide investors with updates regarding conditions in the hard drive industry and on the Company's guidance for its second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:
     As a result, the Company is updating its financial guidance for the December quarter to:
     While its visibility for the March quarter is limited at this time, the Company anticipates seeing typical seasonally softer unit volumes and gross margins in that period.
     The Company also indicated that OEM qualifications for its WD Scorpio mobile hard drives continue to progress.
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning the Company's expectations regarding sales unit volumes with OEMs, distribution volume, channel inventory and sales linearity for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and the Company's current outlook for the December quarter regarding revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and earnings per share and for the March quarter regarding unit volumes and gross margins.

On December 31, 2004, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") terminated the Companys Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan (the "Executive Bonus Plan"), to address certain requirements under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act"), which changed certain tax rules that govern non-qualified deferred compensation plans.

No benefits are owed to Executive Bonus Plan participants under the Executive Bonus Plan as of the date of termination, and no benefits are owed as a result of the termination. The Companys Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, which allows directors, certain members of management and o ther highly compensated employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including our named executive officers, to defer a portion of their compensation (including base salary, director fees and bonus), remains in effect.

1. On January 20, 2005, Western Digital Corporation awarded cash performance bonuses for the first six months of fiscal year 2005 to certain Western Digital named executive officers under the Western Digital Incentive Compensation Plan. Matthew E. Massengill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will receive $600,000, Arif Shakeel, President and Chief Operating Officer, will receive $370,000, Stephen D. Milligan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will receive $171,000, and Raymond M. Bukaty, Senior Vice President, Administration and General Counsel, will receive $171,000. The bonuses were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the independent outside director members of the Board of Directors, based upon an evaluation of the performance of each officer and Western Digital during the first six months of fiscal year 2005 relative to the criteria established by the Compensation Committee in May 2004, related to Western Digitals earnings per share and cash flow from operations. 2. On January 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the independent outside director members of the Board of Directors of Western Digital approved target awards of restricted stock units with performance-based vesting ("Performance Shares") for certain Western Digital named executive officers under the Western Digital 2004 Performance Incentive Plan. Mr. Massengills target was set at 210,000 Performance Shares, Mr. Shakeels target was set at 115,000 Performance Shares, Mr. Milligans target was set at 55,000 Performance Shares and Mr. Bukatys target was set at 58,000 Performance Shares. The Performance Share awards represent a target number of restricted stock units to be later credited to the account of each named executive officer, subject to adjustment based on the financial performance of Western Digital. Following the end of each of the three fiscal years ending in 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Compensation Commit tee of the Board of Directors will credit to each executive officers account a number of Performance Shares equal to an amount between 0% and 300% of one-third of the target number of Performance Shares. The number of Performance Shares credited will depend upon the level of Western Digitals achievement of specified business objectives of revenue growth and cash flow during the prior fiscal year. The value of a Performance Share tracks the value of a share of Western Digitals Common Stock. In July 2008, all Performance Shares credited by the Compensation Committee to each named executive officers account will be paid in the form of Western Digital Common Stock on a one-for-one basis and issued to the named executive officer, subject to applicable withholding taxes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jan. 27, 2005  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenues of $955 million on shipments of approximately 16.2 million units, and net income of $56.0 million, or $0.26 per share, for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2004.
     The second quarter results represent a significant improvement over the company's financial performance in its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 1, 2004, when it reported revenues of $824 million on unit shipments of 14.2 million, and net income of $30.4 million, or $0.14 per share. A year ago in the December 2004 quarter, WD generated revenue of $835 million, shipped approximately 12.7 million units and earned $68.8 million, or $0.32 per share.

drives for consumer electronics applications, an increase of over 200 percent increase from the year-ago period.
     "In addition to the robust market demand, the second quarter results demonstrate the strength of the WD business model and our ongoing operational excellence," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. The demand for hard drives in all segments was strong, especially in desktop and consumer electronics applications, and WD continued to serve these markets with world-class quality and highly reliable products.
     "We expanded our coverage of high-growth markets in the second quarter," said Massengill, noting that the company shipped in volume its 2.5-inch WD Scorpio drives for mobile computing applications and shipped its new 320 GB WD Caviar hard drive for the high-capacity markets. Additionally, the company shipped more than 4 million Serial ATA hard drives in the quarter. Last week, the company announced its entry into the miniature hard drive market with a 6 GB one-inch hard drive for handheld consumer applications.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company's cash at the end of the quarter grew to $493 million, an increase of $87 million from the September quarter. The company generated $143 million in cash from operations, and it repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $8 million. Since the inception in May 2004 of the company's share repurchase program, it has repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares at a total cost of $39.3 million.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
At an investment conference on Wednesday, February 23, 2005, Company executives will provide investors with updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry and about its new product programs. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  As expected, demand in the desktop hard drive market in the March quarter is consistent with typically softer seasonal trends, which include less linear shipment patterns than the December 2004 quarter.  As previously indicated, the Companys growing presence in both the PVR/DVR and notebook PC markets is helping to partially mitigate the quarters desktop seasonality.  Pricing, OEM demand and sell-through in the distribution channel are all tracking to expectations thus far in the March quarter and reflect typical seasonality.  Weeks of inventory in the distribution channel for the industry and for the Company are within the long-stated manageable range of 4 to 6 weeks.  The Companys new product programs aimed at new markets for WD -- the 2.5-inch WD Scorpio(TM) hard drives for notebook PCs and its 1-inch hard drive for consumer applications -- continue to progress well and generate high customer interest.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning: conditions in the hard drive industry, including the Company's expectations for hard drive demand in traditional and emerging markets and its expectations regarding pricing, OEM demand and sell-through in the distribution channel for the March quarter; the progress of the Company's expansion into the 2.5-inch and sub 2.5-inch hard drive markets; and the Company's expectations regarding channel inventory and the effects of seasonality in the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer m ix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard disk drive markets, including the 2.5-inch and sub 2.5-inch markets; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes; business conditions and growth in the desktop, 2.5-inch notebook, consumer electronics, handheld applications, SATA and enterprise markets; changes in availability and cost of specialized product components; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.March 30, 2005Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC) today announced an update to its business outlook for the company's third fiscal quarter ending April 1, 2005.
The company indicated that pricing for desktop hard drives in distribution and at OEM customers has been better than expected in the March quarter and demand for higher capacity hard drives from both consumer desktop PC and consumer electronics markets has been strong, resulting in a better product mix. These dynamics, combined with the company's ongoing cost and quality leadership, resulted in better-than-expected financial performance in the quarter.
WD expects to earn between 29 cents to 31 cents a share for the third fiscal quarter on revenues of $900 million to $915 million, with gross margin of approximately 18 percent. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $96 million. In January, the company provided a third fiscal quarter outlook of earnings per share between 16 cents and 19 cents on revenue between $885 million and $915 million and gross margin of approximately 14.5 percent. It had forecasted operating expenses of about $94 million for the quarter.
"Overall industry demand for hard drives in the traditional computing markets during the March quarter has been seasonal as expected but consumer demand trends have been better than anticipated," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "Demand from consumers for both high capacity desktop hard drives and for hard drives in applications such as personal and digital video recorders has remained strong throughout the quarter. Coupled with a well balanced supply and demand environment, these trends have led to a more-favorable-than-anticipated pricing environment."
The company also indicated that distribution channel inventory of its products and for the industry are between four to five weeks.
June Quarter Commentary
The company indicated that it is premature to provide a quantitative business outlook for the June quarter coming off of the exceptional performance in its third fiscal quarter. Directionally, it is too early to indicate anything other than normal seasonal trends, which typically result in lower unit volumes, revenue and gross margins.

     "The supply/demand environment in the hard drive industry was well balanced throughout the quarter, which translated into an improved pricing environment," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of WD.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 28, 2005, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended July 1, 2005. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Company's press release reports net income and earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 and for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. The non-GAAP measures presented in the press release for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 exclude a $19 million charge for the settlement of a lawsuit. Including this item, net income on a GAAP basis was $41.2 million, or $.19 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005 and $198.4 million, or $.91 per share, for the full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005. The non-GAAP measures presented for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 exclude $50.4 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Company's acquisition of the assets of Read-Rite Corp. in July 2003, reduced by $1.3 million, the amount of tax expense that would have been recorded had these charges not been incurred. Including these items, net income on a GAAP basis was $151.3 million, or $.70 per share, for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors in comparing the results of the quarter and the full fiscal year with prior periods because they provide investors with a basis to measure the core operating performance of the Company's business against prior periods without regard to the settlement charge, start-up expenses and other one-time charges described above. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     From a balance sheet perspective, the company's cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter grew to $598 million, an increase of $24 million from the March quarter. The company generated $113 million in cash from operations in the June quarter. It also repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $21.7 million in the June quarter. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2004, the company has repurchased 6.7 million shares for approximately $61 million.
     "We continue to increase our presence in markets for hard drives such as notebook PCs, enterprise applications and personal and digital video recorders while maintaining our leadership in the high-volume desktop PC business," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We saw healthy demand in all of our markets in what is typically the slowest quarter of the year for our industry."
     WD indicated that 23 percent of its Q4 revenue was derived from sources including consumer electronics, enterprise applications, notebook PCs and retail sales. Seventy-seven percent of the company's fourth quarter revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 15 percent non-desktop PC revenue, 85 percent desktop PC revenue. In fiscal 2005, WD funded, developed or launched several new products aimed at the consumer electronics segments for personal and digital video recorders (PVR/DVR) and handheld devices and at the markets for notebook PCs, enterprise and retail consumer storage.

From the Effective Date through September 30, 2005, Executive shall continue to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and shall report to the Company's Board of Directors. B. Chairman of the Board. From October 1, 2005 through January 1, 2007, Executive shall serve as Chairman of the Board or in such other executive position or capacity as the Board of Directors may assign Executive. Executive shall report to the Board of Directors, and shall have such duties and responsibilities as the Board of Directors shall determine from time to time, including, but not limited to, offering assistance to the Company's new Chief Executive Officer as may be requested and coordinating investor communications. C. Executive agrees to devote substantially all of his time, energy and ability to the business of the Company. 3. COMPENSATION. A. Base Salary. From the Effective Date through January 1, 2007, the Company will continue to pay to Executive a base salary at the rate of $800,000 per year. Such salary shall be earned monthly and shall be payable in periodic installments in accordance with the Company's customary practices. Amounts payable shall be reduced by standard withholding and other authorized deductions.
B. Bonus. Executive's target annual bonus each fiscal year during the Employment Period (including with respect to fiscal 2006) for purposes of the Company's semi-annual bonus program for such fiscal period shall be 100% of his base salary from the Company for such fiscal period. C. Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans; Fringe Benefits. Executive (and, in the case of welfare benefit plans, his eligible dependents, as the case may be), shall be eligible for participation in the retirement, welfare, and fringe benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company on terms consistent with those generally applicable to the Company's other senior executives and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. D. Expenses. Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable employment expenses incurred by him in accordance with the policies, practices and procedures as in effect generally with respect to other executives of the Company. E. Modification. The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue any and all of the above plans, practices, policies and programs at any time without recourse by Executive so long as such action is taken generally with respect to other senior executives of the Company and does not single out Executive; provided, however, that the Company may not eliminate or materially diminish Executive's opportunity to earn a bonus pursuant to Section 3.B. or receive expense reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.E. 4. RESTRICTED STOCK; OTHER EQUITY AWARDS. A. The following awards are hereby terminated and Executive shall have no further rights with respect thereto or in respect thereof: (i) the stock options previously granted by the Company to Executive that are currently outstanding but only to the extent that such options are scheduled (without giving effect to any accelerated vesting provision) to vest after July 31, 2007; (ii) the restricted shares of Company Common Stock previously granted by the Company to Executive that are currently outstanding but only to the extent that such restricted shares are scheduled (without giving effect to any accelerated vesting provision) to vest after July 31, 2007 (which shares are hereby transferred from the Executive to the Company); and (iii) the entire Performance Share Award granted by the Company to Executive on or about January 20, 2005. Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company any share certificates evidencing the shares of restricted stock covered by clause (ii) of the preceding sentence and shall timely provide the Company with such additional documents of transfer that the Company may reasonably request to confirm the transfer of such shares to the Company. B. The stock options previously granted by the Company to Executive that are currently outstanding, to the extent that such options are otherwise scheduled to vest (without giving effect to any accelerated vesting provision) after January 1, 2007 and on or before July 31, 2007, are hereby amended such that such portion of the options is scheduled to vest on January 1, 2007 (subject to Executive's continued employment by the Company through that date other than as expressly provided in Section 5.C(ii)). In the event that Executive remains continuously employed by the Company through January 1, 2007, Executive will have until the later of the following two dates to exercise his stock options granted by the Company to the extent that such stock options are outstanding and otherwise unvested on January 1, 2007: (i) January 1, 2010, and (ii) the time such options would have otherwise expired or been terminated in accordance with the termination of employment rules otherwise applicable to such options; provided that in all cases the options remain subject to earlier termination upon the maximum term of such options and earlier termination in connection with a change in control or similar event affecting the Company as provided for in the applicable stock option agreement or plan under which such options were granted. C. The restricted shares of Company Common Stock previously granted by the Company to Executive that are currently outstanding, to the extent that such restricted shares are otherwise scheduled to vest (without giving effect to any accelerated vesting provision) after January 1, 2007 and on or before July 31, 2007, are hereby amended such that such restricted shares are scheduled to vest on January 1, 2007 (subject to Executive's continued employment by the Company through that date other than as expressly provided in Section 5.C(ii)). D. Other than the bonus opportunity contemplated by Section 3.B, Executive shall have no right to any other annual or long-term incentive compensation or awards with respect to his employment during the Employment Period.
5. TERMINATION. A. Cause. The Company may terminate Executive's employment for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean that the Company, acting in good faith based upon the information then known to the Company, determines that Executive has engaged in or committed: (i) willful misconduct, (ii) fraud, (iii) failure or refusal to perform the duties assigned by the Board of Directors, or (iv) a conviction of or a plea of nolo contendre to a felony. B. Other than Cause. The Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time, with or without cause, upon 30 days' written notice. C. Obligations of the Company Upon Termination. (i) Cause. If Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to Executive other than for the timely payment of the sum of (i) Executive's annual base salary through the date of termination to the extent not theretofore paid and (ii) any compensation previously deferred by Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"). If it is subsequently determined that the Company did not have Cause for termination under this Section 5-C(i), then the Company's decision to terminate shall be deemed to have been made under Section 5-C(ii), and the amounts payable thereunder shall be the only amounts Executive may receive for his termination. (ii) Other than Cause. If the Company terminates Executive's employment for other than Cause, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to Executive other than: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to the base salary and target bonus (at 100% of target) for the remainder of the Employment Period; and (b) accelerated vesting of any and all options and other equity-based awards granted by the Company that are then outstanding and not otherwise fully vested, but only to the extent such awards would have otherwise become vested had Executive remained employed by the Company through July 31, 2007. Any portion of such awards that do not so vest shall automatically terminate upon termination of Executive's employment with the Company and Executive shall have no rights with respect thereto or in respect thereof. Executive's rights as to any options and other equity-based awards granted by the Company that are outstanding at the time Executive's employment with the Company terminates, to the extent such awards are then vesting (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting contemplated by this clause), shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement and incentive plan under which the option or other award, as applicable, was granted. D. Exclusive Remedy. Executive agrees that the payments contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute the exclusive and sole remedy for any termination of his employment, and Executive covenants not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at law or in equity, with respect to any termination of employment. 6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND INVENTION. Executive has previously executed an Employee Invention and Confidentiality Agreement ("Invention Agreement"), which is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. In the event of an inconsistency between a provision of this Agreement and a provision of the Invention Agreement, the provision of this Agreement controls.
7. LITIGATION ASSISTANCE. Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company in any actual or threatened litigation that arises against or brought by the Company at any time during or after the Employment Period, including but not limited to participating in interviews with the Company's counsel to assist the Company in any such litigation. 8. ARBITRATION. Any controversy arising out of or relating to Executive's employment, this Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of its provisions, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange County, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Civil Procedure Code ss.ss. 1280 et seq. as the exclusive remedy of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the Arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the Arbitrator deems just and equitable. Any award or relief granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement or Executive's employment. 9. SUCCESSORS. A. This Agreement is personal to Executive and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, be assignable by Executive. B. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and any such successor or assignee shall be deemed substituted for the Company under the terms of this Agreement for all purposes. As used herein, "successor" and "assignee" shall include any person, firm, corporation or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires the stock of the Company or to which the Company assigns this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. 10. WAIVER. No waiver of any breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall be construed to be, nor shall be, a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by the party waiving the breach. 11. MODIFICATION. This Agreement shall not be modified by any oral agreement, either express or implied, and all modifications hereof shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. 12. SAVINGS CLAUSE. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable.
13. COMPLETE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (and all other agreements, exhibits, and schedules referred to in this Agreement, including without limitation the Invention Agreement) constitutes and contains the entire agreement and final understanding concerning Executive's employment with the Company and the other subject matters addressed herein between the parties. It is intended by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their agreement. It supersedes and replaces all prior negotiations and all agreements proposed or otherwise, whether written or oral, concerning the subject matter hereof.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At the Citigroup Global Technology Conference on Thursday, September 8, 2005 and in meetings with investors on Thursday, September 8, 2005, and Friday, September 9, 2005, WD executives will provide investors with updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry. Specifically, WD expects to communicate the following:  Quarterly demand thus far has reflected typical seasonal trends: relatively soft July and August as planned, with stronger recent distribution sell-through and OEM demand.  Pricing has been within WD's expectations and benign by historic standards.  Weeks of inventory in the channel for the industry and WD have tracked within the manageable 4 to 6 week range throughout the quarter. Total WD inventory is currently flat from the end of June going into September, typically a very strong month.  As anticipated, demand and pricing for the remainder of September will determine the quarters outcome.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning WD's expectations regarding typical demand conditions in the month of September and its belief that demand and pricing for the remainder of September will determine the quarter's outcome. These forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard disk drive markets, including the market for 1-inch hard drives; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes; business conditions and growth in the desktop, notebook, consumer electronics, handheld applications, SATA and enterprise markets; changes in availability and cost of specialized product components; and other risks and uncertainties listed in WD's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. WD undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On and effective September 20, 2005, the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") amended and restated the Company's Bylaws. The following is a summary of changes effected by adoption of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.3 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
GENERAL
     In addition to the amendments described below, the Amended and Restated Bylaws include certain changes to (1) comply or be consistent with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and (2) make various technical corrections or non-substantive changes.
ARTICLE II. MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.
     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws now permit stockholders' meetings to be held by remote communication as permitted by the DGCL.
Place of Meetings
     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws simplify the provisions contained in the former Bylaws relating to notices of meetings at which stockholders are required or permitted to act. In addition, a provision has been added to the Amended and Restated Bylaws to clarify when notices that are mailed to stockholders are deemed to be given. Finally, as permitted by the DGCL, the Amended and Restated Bylaws now expressly permit notice to stockholders to be given by electronic transmission if consented to by the stockholders to whom such notice is given.
Notice of Meetings
     . The former Bylaws did not contain a separate provision addressing the adjournment of stockholder meetings. A new section has been added to the Amended and Restated Bylaws to specifically address the adjournment of stockholder meetings.
Adjournments
     . In the Amended and Restated Bylaws, the period upon which a proxy may be acted has been expanded from the eleven months included in the former Bylaws to three years. In addition, the Amended and Restated Bylaws now include a specific reference to irrevocable proxies and clarify the procedures by which a proxy that is not irrevocable may be revoked. Finally, the exceptions to the default voting requirement of the DGCL are expanded in the Amended and Restated Bylaws to clarify that all matters will be decided by a vote of a majority in voting power of stockholders present and entitled to vote thereon, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company or applicable law or regulation.
Voting
     . The former Bylaws provided that a list of stockholders be made available at the city where the meeting is taking place or at the place of the meeting for 10 days prior to the meeting. Due to changes in the DGCL, this requirement has been substituted in the Amended and Restated Bylaws to provide that the list be made available at the Company's principal place of business or on an electronic network (provided that the information required to access the network is furnished with the notice of the meeting).
List of Stockholders
      . The former Bylaws provided for a judge to make reports with respect to votes taken at stockholders meetings. In order to comply with Section 231 of the DGCL, this provision has been eliminated in the Amended and Restated Bylaws and has been replaced by a
Inspector of Elections
Table of Contents
new section that provides for the appointment of an inspector of elections, refers to each of the specific duties to be discharged by the inspector of elections and requires the inspector of elections to take the statutory oath.
     . The former Bylaws provided for advance notice of stockholder proposals for nominees for director and for other business at an annual meeting of stockholders not less than 60 nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the scheduled meeting, except in limited circumstances. The Amended and Restated Bylaws updates and amends the time period for delivery of such notices to not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day but not later than the close of business on the 90 day prior to the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90 day prior to the annual meeting. Additionally, the Amended and Restated Bylaws (a) expand the information required to be provided by the stockholder making a proposal, including information about persons controlling, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, and (b) establish procedures for the verification of information provided by the stockholder making the proposal.
Stockholder Proposals and Nominations

     The Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide that, notwithstanding anything in the advance notice provisions to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement of such action at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by the advance notice provisions will be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 10 day following the day on which public announcement of the new directorship is first made by the Company.
th
     The former Bylaws did not provide for advance notice of stockholder nominees for director at a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors. The Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, in the event the Company calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more individuals to the Board of Directors, a stockholder may nominate an individual or individuals for election as a director as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by the advance notice provisions is delivered to the Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day prior to the special meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90 day prior to the special meeting or the 10 day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws now explicitly describe certain powers of the individual presiding at any stockholder meeting and specifically note that the Board of Directors has the power to adopt the rules and regulations for the conduct of such meetings.
Conduct of Meetings
ARTICLE III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
     . The former Bylaws stated a range of authorized directors of not less than five nor more than twelve unless the Bylaws are amended by the Board or the stockholders. The Amended and Restated Bylaws now provide that the number of directors will be established from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Number and Term of Office
     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws now provide that directors may resign by means of electronic notice.
Resignations
     . The former Bylaws required the Board to meet as soon as practicable after each annual election of directors. The Amended and Restated Bylaws clarify that a quorum must be present at the first meeting and further provide that, alternatively, the first meeting may be held at such time and place as specified in a notice (or a waiver thereof).
First Meeting
     . The former Bylaws provided that notice of regular meetings need not be given except as required by law. This provision has been deleted from the Amended and Restated Bylaws.
Regular Meetings
Table of Contents
     . The former Bylaws provided that notice of a special meeting of directors must be given four days in advance (or 48 hours for notice given personally or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or similar means of communication). The Amended and Restated Bylaws now provide that notice of any special meeting shall be given by the person calling the meeting at least 24 hours in advance thereof.
Special Meetings
     . The former Bylaws provided that a meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors. This provision has been deleted from the Amended and Restated Bylaws.
Quorum and Manner of Acting
     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws now permit directors to consent to any action in writing or by electronic transmission.
Action by Consent
     . The Amended and Restated Bylaws now include a provision relating to the organization of meetings of the Board of Directors and specify which individuals will preside over and act as secretary of any such meeting.

Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of this Corporation the pledgor shall have expressly empowered the pledge to vote thereon.

effect of revoking the same, unless the stockholder shall attend the meeting and vote in person or deliver to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. At any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum is present all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to this Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to this Corporation or its securities, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting power of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted.

2.11 Stockholder Proposals and Nominations.
     (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          (i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board or (C) by any stockholder of this Corporation who was a stockholder of record of this Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a proposal or director nomination to be considered at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2005 Annual Meeting"), stockholders must give written notice of any proposal or nomination of a director to the Secretary of this Corporation at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 120 days prior to the scheduled date of the 2005 Annual Meeting, regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of the 2005 Annual Meeting to a later date. The 2005 Annual Meeting is currently scheduled for November 17, 2005. Stockholder proposals or nominations for director that do not meet the notice requirements set forth above will not be acted upon at the 2005 Annual Meeting.
          (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 2.11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of this Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one
 
hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by this Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (1) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (2) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on this Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of this Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of this Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.11 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified this Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by this Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. This Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of this Corporation.
          (iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by this Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.11 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional
 
directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by this Corporation.
     (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of this Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. In the event this Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in this Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     (c) General.
          (i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of this Section 2.11) and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.11, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
 
been received by this Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
          (ii) For purposes of this Section 2.11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by this Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

The person in whose name shares of stock are registered on the books of this Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards this Corporation. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates shall be presented to this Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferee and the transferor request this Corporation to do so.

In any such action, this Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

Executive's rights as to any options and other equity-based awards granted by the Company that are outstanding at the time Executive's employment with the Company terminates, to the extent such awards are then vesting (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting contemplated by this clause), shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement and incentive plan under which the option or other award, as applicable, was granted.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On October 27, 2005, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     In the Company's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and in its conference call scheduled for 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT today, the Company plans to report the following results for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005 on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis:
     The non-GAAP measures presented for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005 exclude $4.7 million of expenses for stock options. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP per share amounts are further reduced by $0.1 million, the amount of tax expense that would have been recorded had the expenses for stock options not been incurred.
     The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release and during the conference call provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance without regard to stock option expenses that do not reflect the Company's core operating results. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and to management in planning and forecasting for future periods without reference to stock option expenses, in comparing the results of the quarter with prior periods during which the Company was not required to expense such items, and in comparing the results of the quarter with the Company's competitors some of which are not yet subject to FAS 123R. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     In the first fiscal quarter, the company shipped more than one million of its WD Scorpio 2.5-inch mobile hard drives to the industry's fastest-growing high volume marketnotebook PCs. It also shipped approximately 1.3 million 3.5-inch hard drives for utilization in personal and digital video recorders (PVR/DVR).
     WD indicated that 25 percent of its Q1 revenue was derived from non-desktop PC sources including notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications, and retail sales. Seventy-five percent of the company's first quarter revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs, a market that remains strong. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 20 percent non-desktop PC revenue, 80 percent desktop PC revenue.

During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $14 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2004, the company has repurchased 7.8 million shares for approximately $75 million.
     "Western Digital's Q1 performance continues to demonstrate the predictability and sustainability of the company's business model," said Matt Massengill, chairman of Western Digital. "WD has shown the industry's most consistent financial performance over the last two years, while expanding our vertical integration and making major investments in new technologies and new products."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
2004 Performance Incentive Plan Amendment
     The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") has previously approved an amendment to the Western Digital Corporation 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") that would increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2004 Plan by an additional 13,000,000 shares. According to the results from the Company's annual stockholders meeting held on November 17, 2005, the Company's stockholders have approved the 2004 Plan amendment.
     The following summary of the 2004 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2004 Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by this reference.
     The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the 2004 Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the 2004 Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board.
     The administrator of the 2004 Plan has broad authority under the 2004 Plan to, among other things, select participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
     Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
     The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2004 Plan equals the sum of: (1) 17,500,000 shares (after giving effect to the 2004 Plan amendment), plus (2) the number of shares available for additional award grant purposes under the Company's Employee Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the expiration of that plan on November 10, 2004, plus (3) the number of shares available for additional award grant purposes under the Company's Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Company's Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan as of November 18, 2004 (the Employee Stock Option Plan, the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan are referred to collectively as the "Existing Plans"), plus (4) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the Existing Plans and outstanding as of November 18, 2004 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised, plus (5) the number of any shares of restricted stock granted under the Company's Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan that are outstanding and unvested as of November 18, 2004 which are forfeited, terminated, cancelled or otherwise reacquired by the Company without having become vested.
     Shares issued in respect of any "full-value award" granted under the 2004 Plan will be counted against the share limit described in the preceding paragraph as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award. For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of the Company's common stock were granted under the 2004 Plan, 135 shares would be charged against the share limit with respect to that stock bonus award. For this purpose, a "full-value award" generally means any award granted under the 2004 Plan other than: (1) shares delivered in respect of compensation earned but deferred, and (2) shares delivered pursuant to option or stock appreciation right grants the per share exercise or base price, as applicable, of which is at least equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock at the time of grant of the award.
     To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right, only the actual number of shares delivered with respect to the award will be counted against the share limits of the 2004 Plan. To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the share limits of the 2004
Table of Contents
Plan, as opposed to only counting the shares actually issued. Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2004 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2004 Plan.
     The types of awards that may be granted under the 2004 Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common stock or units of the Company's common stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards.
     As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2004 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.
2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     The Board has previously approved the Western Digital Corporation 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). According to the results from the Company's annual stockholders meeting held on November 17, 2005, the Company's stockholders have approved the ESPP.
     The following summary of the ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the ESPP, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by this reference.
     The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the ESPP. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the ESPP to the Compensation Committee of the Board.
     Under the ESPP, 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock are available for purchase by eligible employees who elect to participate in the ESPP. Eligible employees will be entitled to purchase, by means of payroll deductions, limited amounts of the Company's common stock at a discount during periodic offering periods. An offering period may be up to twenty four months long, and may be divided into one or more exercise periods. The Compensation Committee will establish the methodology for setting the purchase price for the stock that may be purchased pursuant to the ESPP each exercise period, except that in no event may the purchase price for an exercise period be lower than the lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock at the start of the offering period in which the exercise period occurs, or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the last day of the exercise period.
     Subject to limited exceptions, all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Subject to certain other limits, no eligible employee may purchase more than $25,000 of stock (valued at the start of the applicable offering period and without giving effect to any discounted purchase price) under the ESPP in any one calendar year.
     As is customary in stock plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the ESPP and any outstanding purchase rights, as well as the applicable purchase prices, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.
Director Compensation
     On November 17, 2005, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee that was based on input from external consultants, the Board approved the following changes to the compensation offered to members of the Board. These changes are effective as noted below:
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
     On November 17, 2005, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adjusted annual base salaries, effective November 17, 2005, for certain named executive officers. Such annual base salaries for each of Stephen D. Milligan and Raymond M. Bukaty were increased from $350,000 to $400,000. As described in Item 5.02 below, the Board set John F. Coyne's annual salary at $600,000.
     At a meeting on November 16, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board established the performance goals for the cash bonus awards under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP Plan) for the second half of fiscal year 2006. The Compensation Committee determined that funding of the ICP Plan for this period will be based upon accomplishment of specific earnings per share and revenue targets, in various combinations. These predetermined performance goals were recommended to, and approved by, the non-management members of the Board on November 17, 2005.
"
     Under the ICP Plan, certain employees of the Company, including the Company's executive officers, may be awarded cash bonus awards based on the Company's achievement of these predetermined performance goals. For executive officers, a target bonus amount has been established as a percentage of base salary ranging from 65% to 100% of base salary. Depending upon the Company's achievement of these predetermined performance goals, the ICP Plan may fund based on a percentage of the target bonus amount (ranging from 0% to 200% of the target). However, individual participation in the ICP Plan is based on individual performance, and actual awards may vary upward or downward.
     Also on November 17, 2005, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved payment of a discretionary cash bonus in the amount of $102,438 to Raymond M. Bukaty, Senior Vice President, Administration, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company.
     A Summary of Compensation Arrangements for Named Executive Officers and Directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     On November 17, 2005, the Board promoted John F. Coyne, age 55, to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer. Previously, Mr. Coyne served as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations.

provided that in no event shall the Share Limit exceed 48,199,313 shares (which is the sum of the 17,500,000 shares set forth above, plus the number of shares available under the Option Plans for additional award grant purposes as of the Effective Date (as such term is defined in Section 8.6.1), plus the aggregate number of shares subject to options previously granted and outstanding under the Option Plans as of the Effective Date, plus the maximum number of shares subject to restricted stock awards previously granted and outstanding under the Broad-Based Plan that had not vested as of the Effective Date).
Shares issued in respect of any "Full-Value Award" granted under this Plan shall be counted against the foregoing Share Limit as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. (For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of Common Stock is granted under this Plan, 135 shares shall be charged against the Share Limit in connection with that award.) For this purpose, a "Full-Value Award" means any award under this Plan that is either: (1) a delivery of shares in respect of compensation earned but deferred, (2) except as expressly provided in Section 5.1.1 (which generally provides that "discounted" stock option grants are Full-Value Awards), a stock option grant, and (3) except as expressly provided in Section 5.1.3 (which generally provides that "discounted" stock appreciation right grants are Full-Value Awards), a stock appreciation right grant.
not
The following limits also apply with respect to awards granted under this Plan:
 
Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.
 
. A stock option is the grant of a right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock during a specified period as determined by the Administrator. An option may be intended as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an "") or a nonqualified stock option (an option not intended to be an ISO). The award agreement for an option will indicate if the option is intended as an ISO; otherwise it will be deemed to be a nonqualified stock option. The maximum term of each option (ISO or nonqualified) shall be ten (10) years. The per share exercise price for each option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the option, except as follows: (a) in the case of a stock option granted as a substitution for another award, the per share exercise price may be no lower than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date such other award was granted (to the extent consistent with Sections 422 and 424 of the Code in the case of options intended as incentive stock options); and (b) in any other circumstances, a nonqualified stock option may be granted with a per share exercise price that is less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, provided that any shares delivered in respect of such option shall be charged against the Share Limit as a Full-Value Award and against the other applicable share limits of Section 4.2 as a Special Full-Value Award. When an option is exercised, the exercise price for the shares to be purchased shall be paid in full in cash or such other method permitted by the Administrator consistent with Section 5.5.
5.1.1
Stock Options
ISO
. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant of the applicable option) of stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to ISOs under this Plan and stock subject to ISOs under all other plans of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (or any parent or predecessor corporation to the extent required by and within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options. In reducing the number of options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the
5.1.2
Additional Rules Applicable to ISOs
 
$100,000 limit, the Administrator may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (for this purpose, the term "subsidiary" is used as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, which generally requires an unbroken chain of ownership of at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of each subsidiary in the chain beginning with the Corporation and ending with the subsidiary in question). There shall be imposed in any award agreement relating to ISOs such other terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the option be an "incentive stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such option is granted.
. A stock appreciation right or "" is a right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Stock, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the SAR was granted (the "base price") as set forth in the applicable award agreement, except as follows: (a) in the case of a SAR granted as a substitution for another award, the base price may be no lower than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date such other award was granted; and (b) in any other circumstances, a SAR may be granted with a base price that is less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, provided that any shares actually delivered in respect of such award shall be charged against the Share Limit as a Full-Value Award and against the other applicable share limits of Section 4.2 as a Special Full-Value Award. The maximum term of an SAR shall be ten (10) years.

The other types of awards that may be granted under this Plan include: (a) stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, whether at a fixed or variable price or ratio related to the Common Stock, upon the passage of time, the occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance criteria or other conditions, or any combination thereof; (b) any similar securities with a value derived from the value of or related to the Common Stock and/or returns thereon; or (c) cash awards granted consistent with Section 5.2 below.

Minimum Vesting Requirements
 
respect to the award, each award granted under this Plan that is a Full-Value Award and payable in shares of Common Stock shall be subject to the following minimum vesting requirements: (a) if the award includes a performance-based vesting condition, the award shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant of the award and vesting shall occur only if the award holder is employed by, a director of, or otherwise providing services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on such vesting date; and (b) if the award does not include a performance-based vesting condition, the award shall not vest more rapidly than in monthly installments over the three-year period immediately following the date of grant of the award and vesting of any vesting installment of the award shall occur only if the award holder is employed by, a director of, or otherwise providing services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on the date such installment is scheduled to vest; provided that the Administrator may accelerate or provide in the applicable award agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Full-Value Award in connection with a change in control of the award holder's employer (or a parent thereof), the termination of the award holder's employment (including a termination of employment due to the award holder's death, disability or retirement, but not including a termination of employment by the award holder's employer for cause), or as consideration or partial consideration for a release by the award holder of pending or threatened claims against the Company, the award holder's employer, or any of their respective officers, directors or other affiliates (regardless of whether the release is given in connection with a termination of employment by the award holder's employer for cause or other circumstances). The Administrator may, however, accelerate or provide in the applicable award agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Full-Value Award in circumstances not contemplated by the preceding sentence, and/or provide for a vesting schedule that is shorter than the minimum schedule contemplated by the preceding sentence, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the portion of any such Full-Value Award that vests earlier than the minimum vesting dates that would be applicable pursuant to the minimum vesting requirements of the preceding sentence (or, as to any accelerated vesting, provides for accelerated vesting other than in the circumstances contemplated by the preceding sentence) shall count against the applicable share limits of Section 4.2 as a Special Full-Value Award (as opposed to counting against such limits only as a Full-Value Award).

Any Qualifying Option or Qualifying SAR shall be subject only to the requirements of Section 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 in order for such award to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Award. Any other Performance-Based Award shall be subject to all of the following provisions of this Section 5.2.
The eligible class of persons for Performance-Based Awards under this Section 5.2 shall be officers and employees of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries. The Administrator approving Performance-Based Awards or making any certification required pursuant to Section 5.2.4 must be constituted as provided in Section 3.1 for awards that are intended as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Class; Administrator
.
The specific performance goals for Performance-Based Awards (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) shall be, on an absolute or relative basis, established based on one or more of the following business criteria ("") as selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion: earnings per share, cash flow (which means cash and cash equivalents derived from either net cash flow from operations or net cash flow from operations, financing and investing activities), total stockholder return, gross revenue, revenue growth, operating income (before or after taxes), net earnings (before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization), return on equity or on assets or on net investment, cost containment or reduction, or any combination thereof. These terms are used as applied under generally accepted accounting principles or in the financial reporting of the Corporation or of its Subsidiaries. To qualify awards as performance-based under Section 162(m), the applicable Business Criterion (or Business Criteria, as the case may be) and specific performance goal or goals ("targets") must be established and approved by the Administrator during the first 90 days of the performance period (and, in the case of performance periods of less than one year, in no event after 25% or more of the performance period has elapsed) and while performance relating to such target(s) remains substantially uncertain within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. Performance targets shall be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other extraordinary events not foreseen at the time the targets were set unless the Administrator provides otherwise at the time of establishing the targets. The applicable performance measurement period may not be less than three months nor more than 10 years.

following sentence) that are granted to any one participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed 800,000 shares, either individually or in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of all Performance-Based Awards payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed $5,000,000. Awards that are cancelled during the year shall be counted against these limits to the extent permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code.
Before any Performance-Based Award under this Section 5.2 (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) is paid and to the extent required to qualify the award as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator must certify in writing that the performance target(s) and any other material terms of the Performance-Based Award were in fact timely satisfied.
5.2.4
Certification of Payment
.
The Administrator will have the discretion to determine the restrictions or other limitations of the individual awards granted under this Section 5.2 including the authority to reduce awards, payouts or vesting or to pay no awards, in its sole discretion, if the Administrator preserves such authority at the time of grant by language to this effect in its authorizing resolutions or otherwise.
5.2.5
Reservation of Discretion
.
As required pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Administrator's authority to grant new awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) shall terminate upon the first meeting of the Corporation's stockholders that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the Corporation's stockholders first approve this Plan.
5.2.6
Expiration of Grant Authority
.
 
In no event shall any shares newly-issued by the Corporation be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration for such shares or for consideration other than consideration permitted by applicable state law. In the event that the Administrator allows a participant to exercise an award by delivering shares of Common Stock previously owned by such participant and unless otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator, any shares delivered which were initially acquired by the participant from the Corporation (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise) must have been owned by the participant at least six months as of the date of delivery. Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an option shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise. The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation.
 
"") for the date in question or, if no sales of Common Stock were made on the Exchange on that date, the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on said composite tape for the next preceding day on which sales of Common Stock were made on the Exchange. The Administrator may, however, provide with respect to one or more awards that the fair market value shall equal the last closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the Exchange available at the relevant time or the average of the high and low trading prices of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the Exchange for the date in question or the most recent trading day. If the Common Stock is no longer listed or is no longer actively traded on the Exchange as of the applicable date, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the award in the circumstances. The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining fair market value with respect to one or more awards if a different methodology is necessary or advisable to secure any intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular award(s) (for example, and without limitation, the Administrator may provide that fair market value for purposes of one or more awards will be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date).
Exchange
. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 5.7, by applicable law and by the award agreement, as the same may be amended, (a) all awards are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (b) awards shall be exercised only by the participant; and (c) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to any award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the participant.
5.7.1
Limitations on Exercise and Transfer
. The Administrator may permit awards to be transferred to other persons or entities pursuant to such conditions and procedures, including limitations on subsequent transfers, as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, establish in writing; provided, however, that any such transfer shall only be permitted if it is made by the participant for estate or tax planning or charitable purposes for no (or nominal) consideration, as determined by the Administrator. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
5.7.2
Exceptions
. The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 5.7.1 shall not apply to:
5.7.3
Further Exceptions to Limits on Transfer
 
 
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award. With respect to any award of an ISO, the Administrator may make such an adjustment that causes the option to cease to qualify as an ISO without the consent of the affected participant.
In any of such events, the Administrator may take such action prior to such event
 
to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares in the same manner as is or will be available to stockholders generally. In the case of any stock split or reverse stock split, if no action is taken by the Administrator, the proportionate adjustments contemplated by clause (a) above shall nevertheless be made.
 
 
 
 
In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) grant (either at the time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, to have the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the
 
appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law. The Corporation may, with the Administrator's approval, accept one or more promissory notes from any Eligible Person in connection with taxes required to be withheld upon the exercise, vesting or payment of any award under this Plan; provided that any such note shall be subject to terms and conditions established by the Administrator and the requirements of applicable law.

      (a) Each Eligible Employee may elect to participate in an Offering Period by completing an enrollment agreement on a form approved by and in a manner prescribed by the Committee (or its delegate) or, if the Committee does not require enrollment forms, by otherwise completing such enrollment procedures as the Committee may prescribe. Such agreement must be filed with the Company or such other procedures must be completed, as applicable, prior to the applicable Enrollment Date, unless the Committee establishes an earlier deadline for filing the enrollment form for all Eligible Employees with respect to a given Offering Period. An Eligible Employee may participate in an Offering Period only if, as of the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period, such Eligible Employee is not participating in any prior Offering Period which is continuing at the time of such proposed enrollment.
      (b) Payroll deductions for a Participant shall commence on the first payroll date on or following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll date in the Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 12.
      (c) Unless a Participant elects otherwise prior to the Enrollment Date of the immediately succeeding Offering Period, an Eligible Employee who is participating in an Offering Period as of the last Exercise Date of such Offering Period (the "Prior Offering Period") shall be deemed (i) to have elected to participate in the immediately succeeding Offering Period and (ii) to have authorized the same payroll deduction for such immediately succeeding Offering Period as was in effect for such Participant immediately prior to the expiration or termination of the Prior Offering Period.
      (d) In its discretion, the Committee may determine (with such determination to be effective no earlier than the first Offering Period that commences after such determination by the Committee) that the participation of all Participants on an Exercise Date in an Offering Period that includes more than one Exercise Period shall terminate and such Participants shall be enrolled in a new Offering Period commencing immediately following such Exercise Date if, during such Offering Period, the Fair Market Value determined as of such Exercise Date within such Offering Period is lower than the Fair Market Value determined as of the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period. In such event, each of such Participants shall be deemed for purposes of this Plan (i) to have elected to participate in such new Offering Period, and (ii) to have authorized the same payroll deduction for such new Offering Period as was in effect for such Participant immediately prior to the Termination Date.
      8.     .
Payroll Deductions
      (a) All Participant contributions to the Plan shall be made only by payroll deductions. At the time a Participant files the enrollment agreement with respect to an Offering Period, the Participant shall authorize payroll deductions to be made on each payroll date during the Offering Period in an amount up to 10% (or such other limit as the Committee may establish prior to the start of the applicable Offering Period) of the Eligible Compensation which the Participant receives on each payroll date during such Offering Period. The Committee also may prescribe other limits, rules or procedures for payroll deductions. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, the amount of such payroll deductions shall be a whole percentage (i.e., 1%, 2%, 3%, etc.) of the Participant's Eligible Compensation.
      (b) All payroll deductions made for a Participant shall be deposited in the Company's general corporate account and shall be credited to the Participant's account under the Plan. No interest shall accrue or be credited with respect to the payroll deductions of a Participant under the Plan. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.
 
      (c) A Participant may discontinue participation in the Plan as provided in Section 12. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in advance of an Offering Period, a Participant may at any time during the Offering Period (but no more than four times in any calendar year) reduce or increase (subject to the limitations of Section 8(a) above) the rate of his or her payroll deductions by completing and filing with the Company a change notice in the form provided by the Company. Any such reduction in the rate of a Participant's payroll deductions shall be effective as of the pay period specified by the Participant in the Participant's change notice, but in no event sooner than the first pay period ending more than fifteen (15) days after the Participant files the change notice with the Company. Any such increase in the rate of a Participant's payroll deductions shall be effective as of the first date of the next Exercise Period within such Offering Period.

Grant of Options
      (a) On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3, 9(b) and 17 hereof, each Participant shall be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period up to a number of shares of the Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant's payroll deductions accumulated during the Exercise Period ending on such Exercise Date by the Exercise Price for such Exercise Period (determined as provided in Section 10 below), provided that the number of shares subject to the option shall not exceed five (5) times the number of shares determined by dividing (i) 10% (or such other maximum limit on a Participant's payroll deductions for the Offering Period as the Committee may establish pursuant to Section 8(a)) of the Participant's Eligible Compensation over the Offering Period (determined based upon the Participant's rate of Eligible Compensation in effect as of the Enrollment Date), by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of the Common Stock on the Enrollment Date multiplied by the percentage (not less than 85%) used to calculate the Exercise Price for that Offering Period.
      (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the grant, such Participant (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Participant pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) which permits such Participant's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any Parent to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.
      10.     
.
Exercise Price
      The Committee shall establish from time to time (but no later than the first Offering Period to commence under the Plan) the method for determining the Exercise Price for each Offering Period under the Plan in accordance with this Section 10, which determination shall be effective no earlier than the first Offering Period that commences after such determination is made by the Committee. In making its determination, the Committee may provide that the Exercise Price for an Offering Period shall be determined by applying a discount amount (not to exceed 15%) to either (1) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period, or (2) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Exercise Date, or (3) the of the Fair Market Value of a share on the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period or the Fair Market Value of a share on the applicable Exercise Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding provisions of this Section 10, in no event shall the Exercise Price per share be less than the par value of a share of Common Stock.

Exercise of Options
      Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 12, the Participant's option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date of the Offering Period, and the maximum number of full shares subject to option will be purchased for the Participant at the applicable Exercise Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in the Participant's account. Any amount remaining in the Participant's account after an Exercise Date that is not sufficient to purchase a whole share shall be held
 
in the account until the next Exercise Date in such Offering Period, unless the Offering Period has been over-subscribed or has terminated with such Exercise Date, in which event (or in the event any other applicable Plan limit has been exceeded by that Participant in that Offering Period) such amount shall be refunded to the Participant.
      12.     
.
Withdrawal; Termination of Employment
      (a) A Participant may withdraw all but not less than all of the payroll deductions credited to the Participant's account under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company. All of the Participant's payroll deductions credited to the Participant's account will be paid to him or her promptly after receipt of the Participant's notice of withdrawal, the Participant's participation in the Plan will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for the purchase of shares will be made. Payroll deductions will not resume on behalf of a Participant who has withdrawn from the Plan unless written notice is delivered to the Company within the open enrollment period preceding the commencement of an Exercise Period directing the Company to resume payroll deductions.
      (b) Upon termination of the Participant's Continuous Employment prior to the Exercise Date of an Offering Period for any reason, including retirement or death, the payroll deductions credited to the Participant's account will be returned to the Participant or, in the case of death, to the Participant's estate, and the Participant's options to purchase shares under the Plan will be automatically terminated.
      (c) In the event a Participant fails to maintain Continuous Employment for at least twenty (20) hours per week during an Offering Period, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan, the payroll deductions credited to the Participant's account will be returned to the Participant, and the Participant's options to purchase shares under the Plan will be terminated.
      (d) A Participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon the Participant's eligibility to participate in a succeeding Offering Period or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.
      13.

Transferability
      Neither payroll deductions credited to a Participant's account nor options to purchase Common Stock granted under the Plan may be transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Options granted under the Plan are exercisable during a Participant's lifetime only by the Participant.
      14.     
.
Reports
      Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to Participants promptly following each Exercise Date, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
      15.     
.
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization
      (a) If the outstanding shares of Common Stock are increased or decreased, or are changed into or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares, as a result of one or more reorganizations, restructurings, recapitalizations, reclassifications, stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or any similar unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the number and/or kind of shares, and the Exercise Price thereof, which may be issued in the aggregate and to any Participant upon exercise of options granted under the Plan.
      (b) In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each Offering Period then in progress will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation or entity, each option under the Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or entity or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation or entity, unless the Committee determines, in the exercise
 
of its sole discretion and in lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the Participants shall have the right to exercise the option as to all of the optioned stock. If the Committee makes an option fully exercisable under these circumstances in lieu of assumption or substitution, each Offering Period then in progress shall be shortened and a new Exercise Date shall be set (the ""), as of which date any Offering Period then in progress will terminate. The New Exercise Date shall be on or before the date of consummation of the transaction and the Committee shall notify each participant in writing, at least ten (10) days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for his or her option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that his or her option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date he or she has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 12. The Exercise Price on the New Exercise Date shall be determined as provided in Section 10 hereof, and for purposes of determining such Exercise Price, the New Exercise Date shall be treated as the "Exercise Date."
New Exercise Date
      (c) In all cases, the Committee shall have full discretion to exercise any of the powers and authority provided under this Section 15, and the Committee's actions hereunder shall be final and binding on all Participants. No fractional shares of stock shall be issued under the Plan pursuant to any adjustment authorized under the provisions of this Section 15.
      16.     
.
Amendment of the Plan
      The Board may at any time, or from time to time, amend or suspend the Plan, in whole or in part and without notice; provided, however, that the Plan may not be amended in any way that will cause rights issued under the Plan to fail to meet the requirements for employee stock purchase plans as defined in Section 423 of the Code or any successor thereto, including, without limitation, shareholder approval if required. No options may be granted during any suspension of the Plan or after a termination of the Plan pursuant to Section 17(b) below, but the Committee will retain jurisdiction as to options then outstanding in accordance with the terms of the Plan. No amendment, suspension or termination pursuant to this Section 16 or Section 17 shall, without written consent of the Participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the Participant any right or benefits of such Participant or obligations of the Company under any option granted under the Plan prior to the effective date of such change; provided that the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as to any outstanding options granted under the Plan for an Offering Period, effective as of any Exercise Date within that Offering Period, without the consent of the Participants to whom such options were granted. In no event shall changes contemplated by Section 7(d) or Section 15 be deemed to constitute changes or amendments requiring Participant consent.

.
Termination of the Plan
      The Plan and all rights of Employees hereunder shall terminate:
      In the event that the Plan terminates under circumstances described in Section 17(a) above, reserved shares remaining as of the termination date shall be sold to Participants on a pro rata basis.
      18.     
.
Notices
      All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
      19.     
.
Shareholder Approval
      Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve months before or after the date the Plan is adopted.

      20.     
.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
      (a) The Plan, the grant and exercise of options to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan, and the Company's obligation to sell and deliver shares upon the exercise of options to purchase shares shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be required.
      (b) The Company may make such provisions as it deems appropriate for withholding by the Company pursuant to federal or state income tax laws of such amounts as the Company determines it is required to withhold in connection with the purchase or sale by a Participant of any Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. The Company may require a Participant to satisfy any relevant tax requirements before authorizing any issuance of Common Stock to such Participant.
      21.     
.
Employees' Rights
      (a) Nothing in the Plan (or in any other document related to the Plan) will confer upon any Eligible Employee or Participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Company or any Subsidiary, constitute any contract or agreement of employment or other service or affect an employee's status as an employee at will, nor shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to change such person's compensation or other benefits or to terminate his or her employment or other service, with or without cause. Nothing contained in this Section 21(a), however, is intended to adversely affect any express independent right of any such person under a separate employment or service contract.
      (b) No Participant or other person will have any right, title or interest in any fund or in any specific asset (including shares of Common Stock) of the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of any option hereunder. Neither the provisions of the Plan (or of any other document related to the Plan), nor the creation or adoption of the Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan will create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Participant or other person. To the extent that a Participant or other person acquires a right to receive payment pursuant to the Plan, such right will be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
      (c) A Participant will not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership as to any shares of Common Stock not actually delivered to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a shareholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.
      22.     
.
Miscellaneous
      (a) The Plan, the options granted hereunder and any other documents related to the Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.
      (b) If any provision of the Plan shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.
      (c) Captions and headings are given to the sections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such captions and headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction of interpretation of the Plan or any provision hereof.
      (d) The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other Company or Subsidiary compensation or incentive plans in effect. Nothing in the Plan will limit or be deemed to limit the authority of the Board or Committee (1) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (with or without reference to the Common Stock), or (2) to grant or assume options (outside the scope of and in addition to those contemplated by the Plan) in connection with any proper corporate purpose; to the extent consistent with any other plan or authority. Benefits received by a Participant under an option granted pursuant to the Plan shall not be deemed a part of the Participant's compensation for purposes of the determination of benefits under any other employee welfare or benefit plans or arrangements, if any, provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, except where the Committee or the Board (or the Board of Directors of the Subsidiary that sponsors such plan or arrangement, as applicable) expressly otherwise provides or authorizes in writing.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At meetings with investors in connection with a conference beginning on Tuesday, November 29, 2005, Company executives will provide investors with updates regarding conditions in the hard drive industry and on the Companys guidance for its second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2005. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  Demand is seasonally strong for desktop, notebook, ESATA, retail, and PVR/DVR hard drives and as is typical, unit shipment levels have been relatively linear.  Pricing in all segments of its business has been better than expected and the Company has continued to make improvements in manufacturing cost efficiencies, leading to better than expected gross margin performance.  Even with improved results, the Company still anticipates a substantial reduction of its total inventories by quarters end from levels at the outset of the quarter. Currently, weeks of inventory in the distributi on channel are within the manageable range of four to six weeks for the Company and for the industry. As a result, the Company is updating its financial guidance for the December quarter to:  Revenues: Approximately $1.04 billion to $1.075 billion  Gross margins: Slightly better than 18 percent  Operating expenses: Remain at original guidance of about $109 million on a non-GAAP basis and at about $114 million on a GAAP basis including stock option expense. The latter expense is expected to total $5 million, net of the related income tax benefit of $.1 million.  Non-GAAP earnings per share of 36 cents to 39 cents; GAAP EPS with stock option expense of 34 cents to 37 cents. Both the non-GAAP and GAAP EPS estimates are calculated using the Company's estimate for GAAP diluted shares outstanding.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At meetings with investors in connection with a conference beginning on Tuesday, November 29, 2005, Company executives will provide investors with updates regarding conditions in the hard drive industry and on the Companys guidance for its second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2005. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  Demand is seasonally strong for desktop, notebook, ESATA, retail, and PVR/DVR hard drives and as is typical, unit shipment levels have been relatively linear.  Pricing in all segments of its business has been better than expected and the Company has continued to make improvements in manufacturing cost efficiencies, leading to better than expected gross margin performance.  Even with improved results, the Company still anticipates a substantial reduction of its total inventories by quarters end from levels at the outset of the quarter. Currently, weeks of inventory in the distributi on channel are within the manageable range of four to six weeks for the Company and for the industry. As a result, the Company is updating its financial guidance for the December quarter to:  Revenues: Approximately $1.04 billion to $1.075 billion  Gross margins: Slightly better than 18 percent  Operating expenses: Remain at original guidance of about $109 million on a non-GAAP basis and at about $114 million on a GAAP basis including stock option expense. The latter expense is expected to total $5 million, net of the related income tax benefit of $.1 million.  Non-GAAP earnings per share of 36 cents to 39 cents; GAAP EPS with stock option expense of 34 cents to 37 cents. Both the non-GAAP and GAAP EPS estimates are calculated using the Company's estimate for GAAP diluted shares outstanding.  As is typical, pricing and demand dynamics for the month of December will determine the Company& #x2019;s financial performance for the December quarter.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding conditions in the hard drive industry, WD's expectations regarding inventory levels at the end of its second fiscal quarter, and WD's current outlook for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2005. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; changes in the availability and cost of specialized product components; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful e xpansion into new hard drive markets, including the 1-inch and other small form factor markets; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes; business conditions and growth in the desktop, notebook, consumer electronics, handheld applications, SATA and enterprise markets; and other risks and uncertainties listed in WDs recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, to which your attention is directed.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On January 26, 2006, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2005. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2005 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     In the Company's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and in its conference call scheduled for 2 p.m. PST/5 p.m. EST today, the Company plans to report the following results for the second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2005 on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis:
     The non-GAAP measures presented for the second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2005 exclude $4.2 million of expenses for stock options and purchase plan shares, of which $3.7 million is classified in operating expenses. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP per share amounts are further adjusted by $0.1 million, the amount of tax savings realized from the expenses for stock options and purchase plan shares.
     The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release and during the conference call provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance without regard to expenses for stock options and purchase plan shares that do not reflect the Company's core operating results. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and to management in planning and forecasting for future periods without reference to these expenses, in comparing the results of the quarter with prior periods during which the Company was not required to expense such items, and in comparing the results of the quarter with the Company's competitors some of which are not yet subject to FAS 123R. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jan. 26, 2006  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $1.1 billion on shipments of approximately 18.1 million units, and net income of $104.3 million, or $.47 per share for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 30, 2005, including $4.2 million of expenses for stock options. Excluding stock option expenses, net income on a non-GAAP basis was $108.4 million, or $.49 per share. Gross margin for the December quarter was 20.4 percent. During the December quarter, the company also recorded a $7.0 million charge to expense related to the write-off of capitalized software, which is included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
1
     These results represented strong year-over-year performance, including 12 percent unit growth, 17 percent growth in revenue versus $955 million in the year-ago period and 86 percent growth in net income over the $56.0 million reported last year. A year ago, the company reported

earnings of $.26 per share in the fiscal second quarter, shipped 16.2 million units, and posted gross margin of 15.7 percent.
     In the second fiscal quarter, the company showed steady growth in two of the industry's fastest growing market segmentshard drives for notebook computers and for consumer electronics (CE) applications. It shipped approximately 1.4 million of its 2.5-inch WD Scorpio mobile hard drives and approximately 1.5 million of its 3.5-inch drives to the DVR market, compared with over 1 million and 1.3 million in the first quarter, respectively.
     Continuing to reflect the broadening of its business, WD derived 26 percent of its Q2 revenue from non-desktop PC sources including notebook PCs, CE, enterprise applications, and retail sales. Seventy-four percent of the company's second quarter revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs, a market that remains strong. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 19 percent non-desktop PC revenue and 81 percent desktop PC revenue.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company generated $117 million in cash from operations during the December quarter, ending with total cash and short-term investments of $645 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for approximately $12 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2004, the company has repurchased 8.8 million shares for approximately $87 million.
     "We are pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter as we executed well on the significant opportunities provided by our customers in multiple markets," said Arif Shakeel, president and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "Industry fundamentals were strong with demand and pricing reflecting favorable seasonal trends. Our continued focus on quality, cost reductions, and maximizing our product mix were important factors in Q2 and will remain priorities going forward.

In calendar 2006, we will also be advancing our technologies as we refresh our product line so that we may continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders."
     Shakeel noted that earlier today and earlier this month the company announced the shipment of several new products aimed at the desktop, notebook PC, enterprise, gaming enthusiast, and CE markets (see separate announcements). "Each of these products is shipping to customers and has met our stringent criteria for quality, reliability, cost and volume production release," said Shakeel. "They are the result of our sharp focus on delivering strong returns on our R&D investments."
     The investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook will be broadcast live over the Internet today at 2 p.m. PST/5 p.m. EST. The call will be accessible live and on an archived basis via the link below:

Form of Award Agreements under 2004 Performance Incentive Plan
     On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") approved a form of Notice of Grant of Stock Units and Stock Unit Award Agreement  Executives (the "Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement") and a form of Notice of Grant of Stock Units and Stock Unit Award Agreement Employees (the "Employee Stock Unit Award Agreement") under the Company's Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"). In general, each of the Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement and the Employee Stock Unit Award Agreement provide for the award of stock units to the recipients of such agreements. Each stock unit covered by the award agreement is a non-voting unit of measurement that is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company's common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement) and will vest and be payable to the recipient, in shares of the Company's common stock, in percentage installments of the aggregate number of stock units granted to the recipient as determined by the administrator(s) of the 2004 Plan. All unvested stock units covered by the award agreement will be forfeited to the Company if the recipient ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except that in the event of a recipient's death, a pro rata portion of the unvested stock units will automatically become fully vested as of the date of death as further provided in the agreements. If eligible, each recipient will be permitted to defer the stock units covered by the award agreement pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition, the Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement further provides that all unvested stock units will automatically vest and become payable upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (as defined in the 2004 Plan), subject to certain limitations as specified in the Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement.
     On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee also approved a form of Notice of Grant of Long-Term Cash Award and Long-Term Cash Award Agreement  Executives (the "Executive Cash Award Agreement") and a Notice of Grant of Long-Term Cash Award and Long-Term Cash Award Agreement Employees (the "Employee Cash Award Agreement") under the 2004 Plan. In general, each of the Executive Cash Award Agreement and the Employee Cash Award Agreement provide for the award of a long-term cash award valued at a target amount determined by the administrator(s) of the 2004 Plan. The long-term cash award will be payable at the end of the performance period set forth in the agreements (at, above or below the target amount awarded) based on the achievement of one or more objective performance goals also set forth in the agreements (subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement). In the event the recipient ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries before the end of the applicable performance period, the long-term cash award will terminate, except that in the event of a recipient's death, a pro rata portion of the long-term cash award will be payable to the recipient's legal representative as further provided in the agreements. If eligible, each recipient will be permitted to defer payment of the long-term cash award covered by the award agreement pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition, the Executive Cash Award Agreement further provides that 100% of the target award amount (or such greater percentage as the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate in the circumstances) will become payable upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event (as defined in the 2004 Plan) as further provided in the Executive Cash Award Agreement.
     In addition to the awards described below, each of the foregoing agreements may be used for future grants of stock units or long-term cash awards to the Company's employees, including the named executive officers. The foregoing descriptions of the Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement, the Employee Stock Unit Award Agreement, the Executive Cash Award Agreement and the Employee Cash Award Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of such agreements, which are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, Exhibit 10.2, Exhibit 10.3 and Exhibit 10.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by this reference.

Table of Contents
     In addition, on February 16, 2006, in consideration of the execution by each of the following named executive officers of a written agreement to cancel the performance shares previously awarded to such named executive officer, the Compensation Committee approved an award of stock units to each such named executive officer as follows:
     Each stock unit award is subject to the Executive Stock Unit Award Agreement in substantially the form filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, and will vest 100% on August 31, 2008.
     At its meeting on February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee also established the performance goals for long-term cash awards granted under the 2004 Plan. The Compensation Committee determined that payment of each long-term cash award will be conditioned upon the Company's accomplishment of predetermined performance goals as measured by a predetermined financial operating metric for the eighteen-month period beginning December 31, 2005 and ending June 29, 2007 (the "Measurement Period"). Depending upon the Company's achievement of these predetermined performance goals, each long-term cash award will be paid within a reasonable period of time following the end of the Measurement Period based on a percentage of the target award amount (ranging from 0% to 200%). Each such long-term cash award will be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Cash Award Agreement or the Employee Cash Award Agreement, as applicable.
Executive Severance Plan
     On February 16, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted and approved the Western Digital Corporation Executive Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan"). The following summary of the Executive Severance Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the plan, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by this reference.
     Participants in the Executive Severance Plan include certain of the Company's senior management who are not otherwise currently party to a written employment agreement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than an agreement providing for at-will employment and for no specified term) and who the Board or the Compensation Committee has designated as eligible to participate in the plan as a Tier 1 Executive, Tier 2 Executive or Tier 3 Executive. The Compensation Committee
Table of Contents
has designated each of John F. Coyne, Hossein M. Moghadam, Stephen D. Milligan and Raymond M. Bukaty as Tier 1 Executives.
     The Executive Severance Plan provides that a participant will receive the following severance benefits in the event of termination of employment without cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan):
     Payment of the foregoing severance benefits is conditioned upon the participant's execution of a valid and effective release. In addition, no participant will be entitled to a duplication of benefits under the Executive Severance Plan and any other severance plan or program of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
     The Executive Severance Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated at any time in the sole discretion of the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, no amendment, suspension or termination shall have the effect of diminishing severance benefits to a participant whose employment has been terminated prior to the amendment, suspension or termination.
Change of Control Severance Plan
     The Company's Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan (the "Change of Control Severance Plan") was due to expire on March 29, 2006. On February 16, 2006, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved amendments to the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan to (i) extend the term of the Change of Control Severance Plan to March 29, 2011, (ii) conform the definition of "Change in Control" as used in the Change of Control Severance Plan to the change in control event definition as set forth in the 2004 Plan, and (iii) provide that the Change of Control Severance Plan shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and any guidance or regulations promulgated thereunder. In all other respects, the existing provisions of the Change of Control Severance Plan remain in effect.

EXHIBIT 10.1 (WESTERN DIGITAL LOGO) Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Telephone 949 672-7000 STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK UNIT AWARDS - EXECUTIVES 2004 Performance Incentive Plan 1. STOCK UNITS SUBJECT TO 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN The Stock Unit Award (the "Award") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Units and Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Notice") was awarded under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Each stock unit covered by the Award ("Stock Unit") is a non-voting unit of measurement that is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan). The holder of the Stock Units is referred to herein as the "Participant." Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the number of shares of Common Stock to eventually be delivered to the Participant if Stock Units held by such Participant vest pursuant to Section 4, Section 7 or Section 8 and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind. Stock Units granted to the Participant shall be credited to an unfunded bookkeeping account maintained by the Corporation on behalf of the Participant (a "Stock Unit Account"). The Stock Units are subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Stock Unit Awards - Executives (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 2. AWARD AGREEMENT The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Award Agreement with respect to the Award pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. DEFERRAL OF STOCK UNITS Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Participant may elect, on a form and in a manner provided by the Corporation, to defer the Stock Units subject to the Award under the Corporation's Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). If the Participant makes such a deferral election, the Stock Units will be paid (to the extent vested) in accordance with the payment provisions of the Deferred Compensation Plan (including without limitation the provisions requiring a six-month payment delay in the event that the Participant is a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code), which are incorporated herein by this reference, and any applicable deferral election made by the Participant under and in accordance with the rules of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Whether or not the Participant elects to defer the Stock Units, any shares of Common Stock issued or delivered with respect to the Stock Units shall be charged against the applicable share limits of the Plan. 4. VESTING Except as otherwise provided in this Award Agreement, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of Stock Units as set forth in the Notice.
An Award may vest and become payable in connection with the occurrence of certain events involving the Corporation as provided for in Section 7 of the Plan. Without limiting the foregoing but subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, to the extent that the Award is outstanding and otherwise unvested immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Award shall vest and become payable as to the outstanding and otherwise unvested Stock Units upon the occurrence of the Change in Control Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Award Agreement or the Plan, if the event giving rise to any accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan is not also a "change in control event" of the Corporation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, then payment with respect to the Award shall not be made until such Stock Units would have become vested and payable without regard to this Section 4 or Section 7 of the Plan. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7 below or under the Plan. 5. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS As of any date that the Corporation pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Corporation shall credit the Participant's Stock Unit Account with an additional number of Stock Units equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Corporation on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the number of Stock Units remaining subject to the Award as of the related dividend payment record date, divided by (iii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of payment of such dividend. If the Participant has not made a deferral election with respect to the Stock Units, then the Stock Units credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate. If the Participant has made a deferral election with respect to the Stock Units, then the Stock Units credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall be credited under, and paid in an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the payment provisions of, the Deferred Compensation Plan and any applicable deferral election made by the Participant under and in accordance with the rules of the Deferred Compensation Plan. 6. TIMING AND MANNER OF PAYMENT OF STOCK UNITS Except as provided in Section 3 or 4 above, on or within fifteen (15) business days following the vesting of any Stock Units granted (or credited pursuant to Section 5) to the Participant (whether pursuant to Section 4 or Section 7 hereof or Section 7 of the Plan), the Corporation shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units that vest on the applicable vesting date (including any Stock Units credited as dividend equivalents pursuant to Section 5 with respect to the Stock Units that vest), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7 of the Plan. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant (or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any shares with respect to the vested Stock Units) delivers to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid pursuant to this Section 6 or that are terminated pursuant to Section 7 hereof or Section 7 of the Plan, and such Stock Units shall be removed from the Participant's Stock Unit Account upon the date of such payment or termination. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, settle any Stock Units credited as dividend equivalents by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of payment (as opposed to payment in the form of shares of Common Stock). 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Subject to earlier vesting as provided in Section 4 and Section 8 hereof, if the Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or due to disability), the Participant's Stock Units shall be forfeited to the Corporation to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested upon the date the 2
Participant's employment or services terminate; provided, however, that in the event of the Participant's death at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, a portion of the otherwise unvested Stock Units shall automatically become fully vested as of such date of death as set forth in the next sentence, and shall be paid to the Participant's legal representative as provided in Section 6 above. In the event the date of the Participant's death is at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the number of Stock Units that shall become vested on the date of the Participant's death equals: (a) the number of Stock Units that would have vested on the next scheduled vesting date applicable to the Award (as set forth in the Notice) (the "Next Scheduled Vesting Date") had the Participant continued to be employed through such date, multiplied by (b) a fraction (not greater than one), the numerator of which is the number of calendar days following the last scheduled vesting date applicable to the Award as set forth in the Notice (or, if there was no such prior vesting date applicable to the Award, the date of grant of the Stock Units (the "Measurement Date") through and including the date of the Participant's death, and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the period beginning with the day after the Measurement Date and ending with the Next Scheduled Vesting Date. 8. ADJUSTMENTS The Administrator may accelerate payment and vesting of the Stock Units in such circumstances as it, in its sole discretion, may determine. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Corporation's stock contemplated by Section 7.1 of the Plan, the Administrator will make adjustments if appropriate in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which dividend equivalents are paid pursuant to Section 5. 9. WITHHOLDING TAXES Upon or in connection with the vesting of the Stock Units, the payment of dividend equivalents and/or the distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Stock Units, the Corporation (or the Subsidiary last employing the Participant) shall have the right at its option to (a) require the Participant to pay or provide for payment in cash of the amount of any taxes that the Corporation or the Subsidiary may be required to withhold with respect to such vesting, payment and/or distribution, or (b) deduct from any amount payable to the Participant the amount of any taxes which the Corporation or the Subsidiary may be required to withhold with respect to such vesting, payment and/or distribution. In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Award Agreement, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, direct the Corporation or the Subsidiary to reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of whole shares, valued at their then fair market value (with the "fair market value" of such shares determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan), to satisfy such withholding obligation at the minimum applicable withholding rates. 10. NONTRANSFERABILITY Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated, encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 11. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 3
12. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Notice and these Standard Terms, the Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5 with respect to dividend equivalent rights) and no voting rights with respect to Stock Units awarded to the Participant and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate. 13. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 13. 14. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Award Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy arising out of or related to the Award, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Award Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee.

The Cash Award is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Long-Term Cash Award - Executives (these "STANDARD TERMS"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, then the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the "AGREEMENT" with respect to the Cash Award pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. The holder of the Cash Award is referred to herein as the "PARTICIPANT." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 2. PERFORMANCE GOALS The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "COMMITTEE") shall set one or more objective performance goals for Participant for the Measurement Period, in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Plan ("PERFORMANCE GOALS"). Upon determination by the Committee of the Performance Goals, the Performance Goals for the Measurement Period shall be attached as Exhibit A hereto. 3. DETERMINATION AND PAYMENT OF CASH AWARD PAYMENT AMOUNT Within a reasonable period of time following the end of the Measurement Period, the Committee shall determine, in accordance with the Performance Goals and related criteria and methodology established by the Committee described on Exhibit A hereto, the extent to which the Performance Goals have been achieved and authorize the cash payment of an award, if any, to Participant (the "CASH AWARD PAYMENT AMOUNT"). The Cash Award Payment Amount shall equal the dollar amount of the Cash Award set forth on the Notice of Grant of Cash Performance Award ("TARGET CASH AWARD") multiplied by a percentage that shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with the Performance Goals and related criteria and methodology described on Exhibit A hereto (the "CASH AWARD PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE"), subject to adjustment as described in this Agreement. Subject to Sections 5 and 6 below, payment of the Cash Award Payment Amount shall be made to Participant or, in the event of Participant's death, to Participant's legal representative, as soon as practicable after the certification of awards by the Committee (but no later than seventy-five days following completion of the Measurement Period), net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 8(b) below. THE CASH AWARD PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE AND THE CASH AWARD PAYMENT AMOUNT ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT (WHICH MAY REDUCTION) AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. 4. TERMINATION AT PAYMENT OF CASH AWARD Unless terminated earlier under Section 5 below, a Participant's rights under this Agreement with respect to the Cash Award awarded under this Agreement shall terminate at the time any Cash Award Payment Amount is paid to Participant or at such time that the Cash Award is no longer eligible to become paid, as determined by the Administrator or the Committee. 2
5. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; CHANGE IN CONTROL EVENTS (a) Termination of Employment. Subject to Section 7.2 or 7.3 of the Plan and subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6 hereof, if the Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or due to disability), the Participant's Cash Award and any right to receive a Cash Award Payment Amount shall terminate to the extent a Cash Award Payment Amount has not yet been determined by the Committee as described in Section 3, as of the date the Participant's employment or services terminate; provided, however, that in the event of the Participant's death at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, a pro-rata portion of the Cash Award Payment Amount shall be paid (equal to the Cash Award Payment Amount that the Participant would have been entitled to had he or she continued to be employed through the applicable payment date, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Measurement Period that the Participant was employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the Participant's death and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Measurement Period) to the Participant's legal representative at the same time as Cash Award Payment Amounts are paid generally with respect to the Measurement Period. The Administrator shall be the sole judge, for purposes of the Cash Award, as to whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated. (b) Change in Control Events. Notwithstanding Section 5(a), upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (as defined in Section 7.3 of the Plan), subject to Section 6 below and Participant then being an Eligible Person, the Cash Award Payment Amount, based on a Cash Award Performance Percentage of 100% (or such greater percentage as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate in the circumstances), multiplied by the Target Cash Award shall become payable hereunder to Participant. Such Cash Award Payment Amount (after giving effect to the foregoing sentence) shall be paid, net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 8(b) below, to Participant or, in the event of Participant's death, to Participant's legal representative, as soon as practicable following the Change in Control Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Change in Control Event giving rise to payment of the Cash Award Payment Amount is not also a "change in control event" as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and regulations or other guidance promulgated thereunder, then payment with respect to the Cash Award shall not be made until the end of the Measurement Period as originally scheduled. 6. ADJUSTMENTS; PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION (a) Adjustments. In determining the Cash Award Performance Percentage and the Cash Award Payment Amount with respect to the Measurement Period, the Committee may adjust the Performance Goals previously determined by the Committee to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 5.2.2 of the Plan. (b) Reduction of Cash Award Payment Amount. Notwithstanding Section 3 or any other term of this Agreement, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion reduce the Cash Award Payment Amount, if the Committee determines that such reduction is necessary or advisable due to current business conditions or for any other reason, including the Committee's judgment that the Performance Goals have become an inappropriate measure of achievement, a change in the employment status, position or duties of the Participant, unsatisfactory performance of the Participant, or the Participant's service for less than the Measurement Period. (c) Performance-Based Compensation. Cash Awards are intended to be Performance-Based Awards based on Business Criteria, as described in Section 5.2 of the Plan. Compensation attributable to the Agreement is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed and administered by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent. 7. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF NATURE OF PLAN AND CASH AWARDS In accepting the Cash Award, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Corporation, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Corporation at any time, as provided in the Plan; 3
(b) the Award of this Cash Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of Cash Awards, or benefits in lieu of Cash Awards even if Cash Awards have been awarded repeatedly in the past; (c) all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Corporation; and (d) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary. 8. TAXES (a) Responsibility for Tax-Related Items. Regardless of any action the Corporation or Participant's actual employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding ("TAX RELATED ITEMS"), Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Related Items legally due by Participant is and remains Participant's responsibility and that the Corporation and/or the Participant's actual employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Cash Award, including the grant of the Cash Award, the determination of the Cash Award Payment Amount or the payment of the Cash Award Payment Amount; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Cash Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax Related Items. (b) Withholding Taxes. The Corporation (or any of its Subsidiaries last employing the Participant) shall be entitled to withhold from any Cash Award Payment Amount an amount necessary to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to such payment. 9. NONTRANSFERABILITY Prior to the time that a Cash Award Payment Amount is paid to Participant, no Cash Award or right to receive a Cash Award Payment Amount, any interest therein, nor any amount payable in respect thereof, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) subject to Section 5(a), transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 10. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 11. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy arising out of or related to the Cash Award, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a 4

(b) This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted to comply with Section 409A. The Corporation reserves the right to amend this Agreement to the extent it reasonably determines is necessary in order to preserve the intended tax consequences of the Cash Award in light of Section 409A and any regulations or other guidance promulgated thereunder. 14.

An Executive whose employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated by the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, without Cause and who meets the departure conditions described in Section 7 shall become a Participant under the Plan and entitled to the benefits set forth in this Section 6. The severance benefits provided under Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6 of the Plan shall be the obligations of, and shall be provided to the Executive by, the entity (the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable) that employs the Executive immediately prior to the Executive's termination of employment.

avoidance of doubt, in no event shall an Executive become entitled to or receive any payment hereunder if the Executive's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated voluntarily by the Executive (for any reason), by the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, for Cause, or on account of the Executive's death or disability (as defined in Section 105(d)(4) of the Code).

The payment shall be paid in one lump-sum cash payment within thirty (30) days of the Participant's compliance with all provisions of Section 7. 6.4 Equity Awards. Notwithstanding anything in the applicable stock incentive plan and/or award agreement to the contrary, upon a Participant's termination of employment, the Participant's then outstanding stock options and restricted stock or stock unit awards that are subject to time-based vesting will vest and become exercisable or payable, as applicable, as if the Participant had remained employed with the Company or a Subsidiary for an additional six (6) months. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is not intended to apply to any equity awards held by the Participant that are subject to performance-based vesting or to supersede any more favorable provision in any stock incentive plan and/or award agreement regarding accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant's termination of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the post-termination exercisability of the Participant's then outstanding stock options shall continue to be governed by the stock incentive plan and stock option agreement applicable to such options.
6.5 Outplacement Services. A Participant shall be eligible for outplacement services, provided by a vendor chosen by the Company or applicable Subsidiary and at the Company's or applicable Subsidiary's expense, after the Participant's termination of employment for up to the number of months set forth below: (a) Tier I Executive: 12 months (b) Tier II Executives: 12 months (c) Tier III Executive: 12 months 6.6 Continued Health Care Coverage.

CONDITIONS TO SEVERANCE BENEFITS 7.1 Release. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company's or applicable Subsidiary's obligation to pay benefits to a Participant under Section 6 is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant execute a valid and effective release of any and all claims in a form and manner acceptable to the Company, and such release is received by the Company no earlier than, and no later than fourteen (14) days (or such other period as required by law) after, the Participant's termination date and is not revoked by the Participant (pursuant to any revocation rights afforded by applicable law) or otherwise rendered unenforceable by the Participant. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the Company or applicable Subsidiary will have no obligation to pay any benefit to the Participant under the Plan unless and until that Participant's release (in such form) has been fully executed by the Participant (and the Participant's spouse, to the extent required by the Company), has been received by the Company, and has become effective and irrevocable by the Participant. 7.2 Departure and Entitlement Procedure. As a condition to becoming a Participant and receiving the severance benefits described in Section 6, the Executive must return and deliver to the Administrator or his or her designee all Company and Subsidiary property within seven (7) days of the Executive's termination date. In addition, except as otherwise provided by
the Company, if an Executive resigns prior to his/her scheduled termination date, then he/she shall not be entitled to any severance payments or any other severance benefits provided herein. 7.3 Offsets. Except as expressly provided below, a Participant shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payments provided for by the Plan by seeking employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any cash payments or benefits provided under the Plan be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by the Participant after his or her termination of employment with the Company or applicable Subsidiary. All severance payments under the Plan shall be subject to legal deductions, and the Company and/or applicable Subsidiary reserves the right to offset the benefits payable under the Plan by any advanced monies the Participant owes the Company or a Subsidiary. The benefits and amounts payable under the Plan shall be reduced (but not below zero) by any severance pay or benefits to which a Participant is or becomes entitled under any other severance pay plan, policy, agreement or arrangement. In addition, in no event shall a Participant become entitled to a duplication of benefits under the Plan and any other severance plan or program of the Company or a Subsidiary. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall a Participant receive benefits under the Plan in connection with his her termination of employment if such Participant is entitled to benefits under the Company's Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan in connection with such termination of employment. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that any Participant is entitled to any period of paid notice under Federal or state law including, but not limited to, the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Sections 2101 et seq., the benefits and amounts payable under the Plan shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the Base Pay received by the Participant during the period of such paid notice. 7.4 Limitation On Employee Rights. The Plan shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with or restrict the right of the Company or applicable Subsidiary to discharge any employee at any time, with or without Cause. 8. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES 8.1 Claim. If a Participant or any other individual (herein referred to as a "Claimant") believes that benefits under the Plan are being wrongfully denied, that the Plan is not being operated properly, that fiduciaries of the Plan have breached their duties, or that the Claimant's legal rights are being violated with respect to the Plan, the Claimant must file a formal claim with the Administrator. Any such claim for benefits must be filed in writing within 90 days of the date upon which the Participant first knew or should have known the facts upon which the claim is based. 8.2 Claim Decision. If any claim for benefits under the Plan is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be so notified by the Administrator within thirty (30) calendar days of the date such person's claim is delivered to the Administrator. At the same time, the Administrator shall notify the Claimant of his or her right to a review by the Administrator and shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, specific reasons for such decision, specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her request for
review, an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an explanation of the Plan's review procedure. 8.3 Request for Review. Any Claimant or duly authorized representative may appeal from such decision by submitting to the Administrator within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of such notice of its decision a written statement: (a) requesting a review of the claim for benefits by the Administrator; (b) setting forth all of the grounds upon which the request for review is based and any facts in support thereof; and (c) setting forth any issues or comments which the Claimant deems relevant to the claim. The Administrator shall act upon such appeal within sixty (60) calendar days after the latter of receipt of the Claimant's request for review by it or receipt of all additional materials reasonably requested by it from such Claimant. 8.4 Review of Decision. The Administrator shall make a full and fair review of an appeal and all written materials submitted by the Claimant in connection therewith and may require the Claimant to submit, within ten (10) calendar days of written notice by the Administrator, such additional facts, documents or other evidence as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in making such a review. On the basis of its review, the Administrator shall make an independent determination of the Claimant's eligibility for an allowance and the amount of such allowance, if any, under this Plan. The decision of the Administrator on any appeal shall be final and conclusive upon all persons if supported by substantial evidence in the record. 8.5 Denial on Review. If on review of a decision, the Administrator denies a claim in whole or in part, it shall give written notice of its decision to the Claimant setting forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, the specific reasons for such denial and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which its decision was based. If a Claimant believes that the Administrator's determination on appeal is incorrect, the Claimant or duly authorized representative may invoke the arbitration procedures described in Section 8.6 or file suit related to such determination; provided that any legal action must be taken by the Claimant within ninety (90) days after the date upon which the Administrator's written decision on review was sent to the Claimant. 8.6 Arbitration. A Claimant who has followed the procedures in Sections 8.1 through 8.5, but who has not obtained full relief on his or her claim for benefits, may, within ninety (90) days following his or her receipt of the Administrator's written decision on review pursuant to Section 8.5, apply in writing to the Administrator for expedited and binding arbitration of his or her claim in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange County, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American
Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.8, provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by the Company, a Subsidiary or an Executive in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the Arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the Arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the Arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the Arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. Any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Executive in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with the Plan are hereby waived. The Company or applicable Subsidiary shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the Arbitrator's fee. In any proceeding to enforce the terms of the Plan, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its or his reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him in connection with resolution of the dispute in addition to any other relief granted. 8.7 Legal Fees and Expenses. If any dispute arises between the parties with respect to the interpretation or performance of the Plan, the prevailing party in any arbitration or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party its attorneys' fees, arbitration or court costs and other expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding. Amounts, if any, paid to the Executive under this Section 8.7 shall be in addition to all other amounts due to the Executive pursuant to the Plan. 9. ADMINISTRATION 9.1 Administrator. Except as provided herein, the Plan shall be administered and operated by the Administrator. The Administrator is empowered to construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan and to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits under the Plan and shall make such determinations in its sole and absolute discretion. The Administrator may at any time delegate to any other named person or body, or reassume therefrom, any of its responsibilities or administrative duties with respect to the Plan. 9.2 Experts; Rules. The Administrator may contract with one or more persons to render advice with regard to any responsibility it has under the Plan. Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Administrator shall from time to time establish such rules for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable. 9.3 Indemnity. The Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, by the purchase of insurance or otherwise, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator and each other fiduciary with respect to the Plan for liabilities or expenses they and each of them incur in carrying out
their respective duties under the Plan, other than for any liabilities or expenses arising out of such fiduciary's gross negligence or willful misconduct. 10. AMENDMENT The Committee (or the Board) reserves the right to amend, suspend and/or terminate the Plan at any time in its sole discretion. No amendment, suspension or termination shall diminish benefits to which a Participant is currently entitled under the Plan. Any modification or other amendment of the Plan shall be in writing, signed by either the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Vice President, Human Resources. 11. GENERAL 11.1 Assignment by Participants. None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Executive or Participant shall be subject to any claim of any creditor and, in particular, the same shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or other legal process by any creditor, nor shall any such Executive have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds that he or she may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefits that are in pay status may be subject to a court order of garnishment or wage assignment, or similar order, or a tax levy. The Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Participant's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If a Participant dies while any amount would still be payable to him or her hereunder had he or she continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid to the Participant's beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the Plan. 11.2 Binding Effect. The Company or applicable Subsidiary will require any successor (whether by purchase of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or applicable Subsidiary to expressly assume and agree to perform all of the obligations of the Company or applicable Subsidiary under the Plan (including the obligation to cause any subsequent successor to also assume the obligations of the Plan) unless such assumption occurs by operation of law. For avoidance of doubt, in the event that a successor of a Subsidiary (whether by purchase of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise) assumes the Subsidiary's obligations under the Plan, the Company will have no obligations under the Plan with respect to the Executives employed by such Subsidiary. 11.3 No Waiver. No waiver of any term, provision or condition of the Plan, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, provision or condition or as a waiver of any other term, provision or condition of the Plan. 11.4 Expenses; Unsecured General Creditor. The benefits and costs of the Plan shall be paid by the Company and/or a Subsidiary out of its general assets. The status of a claim against the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to the benefits provided hereunder shall be same as the status of a claim against the Company or applicable Subsidiary by any general or unsecured creditor.
11.5 ERISA. The Plan is an unfunded compensation arrangement for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company or a Subsidiary and any exemptions under ERISA applicable to such an arrangement shall be applicable to the Plan. 11.6 Section 409A. The Plan shall be construed and interpreted so as to avoid the imputation of any tax liability (penalty or otherwise) pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. The Company may suspend the payment of any benefit pursuant to the Plan to any "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) to a date no earlier than the date that is six months after the employee's separation of service to the extent, if any, the Administrator determines that such suspension is reasonably necessary to satisfy Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (in which case the benefits that would have otherwise been paid during such six month period shall be paid, without interest, as soon as practical following the end of such six month period). 11.7 WARN Act. Benefits payable under the Plan are intended to satisfy, where applicable, any Company obligations under the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any similar obligations that the Company or its Subsidiaries may have under any successor or other severance pay statute. 11.8 Construction. The masculine pronoun shall include the feminine pronoun and the feminine pronoun shall include the masculine pronoun and the singular pronoun shall include the plural pronoun and the plural pronoun shall include the singular pronoun, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 11.9 Governing Law. The Plan shall be construed according to the laws of the State of California, except to the extent such laws are preempted by federal law. 11.10 Severability. If any provision of the Plan is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under the Plan will not be materially and adversely affected hereby, (i) such provision will be fully severable, (ii) the Plan will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of the Plan will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of the Plan a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.
11.11 Notices. Any notice required or permitted by the Plan shall be in writing, delivered by hand, or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized courier service (regularly providing proof of delivery), addressed as follows: (a) if to the Company or, where applicable, the Administrator: Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Attention: Vice President, Human Resources With a copy to: Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Attention: General Counsel (b) if to the Executive or Participant, at the address set forth on the records of the Company or applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, or to such other address or addresses most recently communicated to the Company or applicable Subsidiary by the Executive or Participant.

Commencing on the date a Change in Control shall occur, the Employer shall pay a salary to the Executive at an annual rate at least equal to the annual salary payable to the Executive immediately prior to such date. The salary, as it may be changed from time to time by mutual agreement between the Executive and the Employer, shall be paid in 5
equal installments on each regular payroll payment date after the date of this Plan and shall be subject to regular withholding for federal, state and local taxes in accordance with law. 4.02 Other Benefits. (a) Commencing on the date a Change in Control shall occur, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in and to receive benefits under those employee benefit plans or arrangements (including, without limitation, any pension or welfare plan, life, health, hospitalization and other forms of insurance and all other "fringe" benefits or perquisites) made available to executives of the Company or the Employer, or any successor thereto. The Executive's level of participation in, or entitlements under, any such employee benefit plan or arrangement of any successor to the Company shall be calculated as if the Executive had been an employee of such successor to the Company from the date of the Executive's employment by the Employer. (b) Commencing on the date a Change in Control shall occur, the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement, in accordance with the usual practices of the Employer, for all reasonable travel and other business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his or her duties on behalf of the Employer. 5. Termination of Employment of Executive. 5.01 Payment of Severance Benefits Upon Change of Control. In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, Executive shall be entitled to the severance benefits set forth in Section 6, but only if during the term of this Plan: (a) the Executive's employment by the Employer is terminated by the Employer without Cause within one (1) year after the date of the Change in Control; (b) the Executive terminates his or her employment with the Employer for Good Reason within one (1) year after the date of the Change in Control and complies with the procedures set forth in Section 5.02; (c) the Executive's employment by the Employer is terminated by the Employer prior to the Change in Control and such termination arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control (for purposes of this Plan, meaning that at the time of such termination the Company had entered into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in a Change in Control, or any person had publicly announced its intent to take or consider actions that would constitute a Change in Control, and in each case such Change in Control is consummated, or the Board adopts a resolution to the effect that a potential Change in Control for purposes of this Plan has occurred); or (d) the Executive terminates his or her employment with the Employer for Good Reason prior to the Change in Control, the event constituting Good Reason arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control and the Executive complies with the procedures set forth in Section 5.02. 6
5.02 Good Reason. (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any employment agreement between the Executive and the Employer to the contrary, during the term of this Plan the Executive may terminate his or her employment with the Employer for Good Reason as set forth in Section 5.01(b) or (d) and be entitled to the benefits set forth in Section 6, provided that the Executive gives written notice to the Company and the Employer of his or her election to terminate his or her employment for such reason within 180 days after the time he or she becomes aware of the existence of facts or circumstances constituting Good Reason or, if later, within ten (10) days of the time the claim is resolved pursuant to Section 5.02(b). (b) If the Executive believes that he or she is entitled to terminate his or her employment with the Employer for Good Reason, he or she may apply in writing to the Company for confirmation of such entitlement prior to the Executive's actual separation from employment, by following the claims procedure set forth in Section 9. The submission of such a request by the Executive shall not constitute "Cause" for the Company to terminate the Executive's employment and the Executive shall continue to receive all compensation and benefits he or she was receiving at the time of such submission throughout the resolution of the matter pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 9. If the Executive's request for a termination of employment for Good Reason is denied under both the request and appeal procedures set forth in Sections 9.02 and 9.03, then the parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the claim within ninety (90) days after the claim is submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 9.04. 5.03 Permanent Disability. In the event of a Permanent Disability of the Executive, the Executive shall be entitled to no further benefits under this Plan, provided that the Employer shall have provided the Executive a Notice of Termination and the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of the Executive's duties within thirty (30) days of such Notice of Termination. 5.04 Cause. The Employer may terminate the employment of the Executive for Cause. The Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a Notice of Termination and a certified copy of a resolution of the Board adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board (other than the Executive if he or she is a member of the Board at such time) at a meeting called and held for that purpose and at which the Executive was given an opportunity to be heard, finding that the Executive was guilty of conduct constituting Cause based on reasonable evidence, specifying the particulars thereof in detail. For purposes of this Section 5.04, no act or failure to act on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by him or her not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company and the Employer. 5.05 Notice of Termination. Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Employer or by the Executive (other than termination based on the Executive's death) following a Change in Control shall be communicated by the terminating party in a Notice of Termination to the other party hereto. 7
6. Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination of Employment. 6.01 Severance Benefits. If the Executive shall be terminated from employment with the Employer or shall terminate his or her employment with the Employer as described in Section 5.01, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive the following: (a) In lieu of any further payments to the Executive except as expressly contemplated hereunder, the Employer shall pay as severance pay to the Executive an amount equal to two times (in the case of a Tier 1 Executive) or one times (in the case of a Tier 2 Executive) the Executive's annual base compensation plus target bonus as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or as in effect on the date of the Notice of Termination, whichever is higher. Such cash payment shall be payable in a single sum, within ten (10) business days following the Executive's Date of Termination. (b) Any non-vested stock options granted to the Executive by the Company shall become 100% vested and may be exercised by the Executive for the longer of (i) ninety (90) days after the Date of Termination or (ii) the period specified in the plan or agreement governing such options. (c) For a period of twenty-four months (in the case of a Tier 1 Executive) or twelve months (in the case of a Tier 2 Executive) following the Executive's Date of Termination (the "payment period"), the Executive shall be entitled to the continuation of the same or equivalent life, health, hospitalization, dental and disability insurance coverage and other employee insurance or welfare benefits (including equivalent coverage for his or her spouse and dependent children) and car allowances as he or she was receiving immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event that Executive is ineligible under the terms of such insurance to continue to be so covered, the Employer shall provide Executive with a lump sum payment equal to the cost of obtaining such coverage for the payment period. If the Executive, prior to a Change in Control, was receiving any cash-in-lieu payments designed to enable the Executive to obtain insurance coverage of his or her choosing, the Employer shall, in addition to any other benefits to be provided under this Section 6.01(d), provide Executive with a lump-sum payment equal to the amount of such in-lieu payments that the Executive would have been entitled to receive over the payment period. The benefits to be provided under this Section 6.01(d) shall be reduced to the extent of the receipt of substantially equivalent coverage by the Executive from any successor employer. (d) All awards under the Company's Executive Retention Plan adopted in July, 1998 or any similar plan shall accelerate and be payable fifteen (15) days after the Date of Termination. (e) If any payments received by a Tier 1 Executive pursuant to this Plan will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor or similar provision of the Code or any comparable provision of state law (the "Excise Tax"), the Employer shall pay to the Tier 1 Executive additional compensation such that the net amount received by the Tier 1 Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax (and taking into account any federal, state and local income taxes payable by the Tier 1 Executive as a result of the receipt of such gross-up compensation), shall be equal to the total payments he or she would have received had no such 8
Excise Tax (or any interest or penalties thereon arising primarily from the acts or omissions of the Employer) been paid or incurred. The Employer shall pay such additional compensation at the time when the Employer withholds such Excise Tax from any payments to the Tier 1 Executive. The calculation of the tax gross-up payment shall be approved by the Company's independent certified public accounting firm and the Tier 1 Executive's designated financial advisor. (f) In the event that the amount of payments or other benefits payable to a Tier 2 Executive under this Plan, together with any payments or benefits payable under any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement maintained by the Employer or one of its affiliates, would constitute an 'excess parachute payment' (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), the payments under this Plan shall be reduced (by the minimum possible amounts) until no amount payable to the Tier 2 Executive under this Plan constitutes an 'excess parachute payment' (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code); provided, however, that no such reduction shall be made if the net after-tax payment (after taking into account Federal, state, local or other income and excise taxes) to which the Tier 2 Executive would otherwise be entitled without such reduction would be greater than the net after-tax payment (after taking into account Federal, state, local or other income and excise taxes) to the Tier 2 Executive resulting from the receipt of such payments with such reduction. If, as a result of subsequent events or conditions (including a subsequent payment or absence of a subsequent payment under this Plan or other plans, programs, arrangements or agreements maintained by the Employer or one of its affiliates), it is determined that payments hereunder have been reduced by more than the minimum amount required under this Section 6.01(f), then an additional payment shall be promptly made to the Tier 2 Executive in an amount equal to the excess reduction. All determinations required to be made under this Section 6.01(f), including whether a payment would result in an 'excess parachute payment' and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made and approved by the Company's independent certified public accounting firm and the Tier 2 Executive's designated financial advisor. 6.02 Accrued Benefits. Upon termination of the employment of Executive for any reason, any accumulated but unused vacation shall be paid through the Date of Termination. Upon termination of the employment of Executive as set forth in Section 5.01, any accrued but unpaid bonus shall be paid through the Date of Termination. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder, including without limitation any bonus, in respect of any calendar year during which the Executive is employed by the Employer for less than the entire such year shall be prorated in accordance with the number of days in such calendar year during which he or she is so employed. 7. No Mitigation. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payments provided for by this Plan by seeking employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any cash payments or benefits provided under this Plan be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by the Executive after his or her Date of Termination (except as provided in the last sentence of Section 6.01(d) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is entitled, by operation of any applicable law, to unemployment compensation benefits or benefits under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988 (known as the "WARN" Act) in connection with the termination of his or her employment in addition to amounts required to be paid to him or her under this Plan, then to the extent permitted by applicable statutory law 9
governing severance payments or notice of termination of employment, the Company shall be entitled to offset the amounts payable hereunder by the amounts of any such statutorily mandated payments. 8. Limitation on Rights. 8.01 No Employment Contract. This Plan shall not be deemed to create a contract of employment between the Employer and the Executive and shall create no right in the Executive to continue in the Employer's employment for any specific period of time, or to create any other rights in the Executive or obligations on the part of the Company or its subsidiaries, except as set forth herein. Except as set forth herein, this Plan shall not restrict the right of the Employer to terminate the employment of Executive, or restrict the right of the Executive to terminate his or her employment. 8.02 No Other Exclusions. This Plan shall not be construed to exclude the Executive from participation in any other compensation or benefit programs in which he or she is specifically eligible to participate either prior to or following the Effective Date of this Plan, or any such programs that generally are available to other executive personnel of the Company, nor shall it affect the kind and amount of other compensation to which the Executive is entitled. 9. Administrator and Claims Procedure. 9.01 Administrator. Except as set forth herein, the administrator (the "Administrator") for purposes of this Plan shall be the Company. The Company shall have the right to designate one or more of the Company's or the Employer's employees as the Administrator at any time. The Company shall give the Executive written notice of any change in the Administrator, or in the address or telephone number of the same. 9.02 Claims Procedure. The Executive, or other person claiming through the Executive, must file a written claim for benefits with the Administrator as a prerequisite to the payment of benefits under this Plan. The Administrator shall make all determinations as to the right of any person to receive benefits under Sections 9.02 and 9.03. The decision by the Administrator of a claim for benefits by the Executive, his or her heirs or personal representative (the "claimant") shall be stated in writing by the Administrator and delivered or mailed to the claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial thirty-day period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of thirty (30) days from the end of the initial period. Any notice of denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, specific reference to pertinent provisions of this Plan upon which the denial is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her claim, with an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and a description of claim review procedures, written to the best of the Administrator's ability in a manner that may be understood without legal or actuarial counsel. 10
9.03 Appeals. A claimant whose claim for benefits has been wholly or partially denied by the Administrator may request, within sixty (60) days following the date of such denial, in a writing addressed to the Administrator, a review of such denial. The claimant shall be entitled to submit written comments, documents, records and other information he or she shall consider relevant to a determination of his or her claim, and he or she may include a request for a hearing in person before the Administrator. Prior to submitting his or her request, the claimant shall be entitled to review such documents, records, and other information as the Administrator shall reasonably agree are pertinent to his or her claim. The claimant may, at all stages of the review, be represented by counsel, legal or otherwise, of his or her choice, provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the claimant, unless the claimant is successful, in which case, such costs shall be borne by the Company. The review of the claim shall take into account all information submitted by claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted in the initial benefit determination. All requests for review shall be promptly resolved. The Administrator's decision with respect to any such review shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the claimant not later than sixty (60) days following receipt by the Administrator of the claimant's request unless special circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require an extension of time for processing, in which case the Administrator's decision shall be so mailed not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt of the claimant's request. The time and place of any hearing shall be as mutually agreed by the parties. If the claimant is dissatisfied with the Administrator's decision on review, the claimant may then either, at his or her option, invoke the arbitration procedures described in Section 9.04 or pursue a remedy in a judicial forum. No legal action may be commenced prior to the completion of the claims and appeals procedures described in the foregoing provisions of Section 9.02 and 9.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no legal action may be commenced after ninety (90) days after the date upon which the Administrator's written decision on appeal was sent to claimant. 9.04 Arbitration. A claimant who has followed the procedures in Sections 9.02 and 9.03, but who has not obtained full relief on his or her claim for benefits, may, within sixty (60) days following his or her receipt of the Administrator's written decision on review pursuant to Section 9.03, apply in writing to the Administrator for expedited and binding arbitration of his or her claim before an arbitrator in Orange County, California in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, as then in effect, or pursuant to such other form of alternative dispute resolution as the parties may agree (collectively, the "arbitration"). Subject to Section 10, the Company or the Employer shall pay filing fees and other costs required to initiate the arbitration. The arbitrator's sole authority shall be to interpret and apply the provisions of this Plan; and except as set forth herein he or she shall not change, add to, or subtract from, any of its provisions. The arbitrator shall have the power to compel attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any court having jurisdiction may enter a judgment based upon such arbitration. The arbitrator shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Company and the claimant; provided that if the Company and the claimant cannot agree, the arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the applicable commercial arbitration rules. The arbitrator shall be a professional person with a reputation in the community for expertise in employee benefit matters and who is unrelated to the claimant, the Company or its subsidiaries or any employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the claimant and the Company. 11
10. Legal Fees and Expenses. If any dispute arises between the parties with respect to the interpretation or performance of this Plan, the prevailing party in any arbitration or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party its attorneys fees, arbitration or court costs and other expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding. Amounts, if any, paid to the Executive under this Section 10 shall be in addition to all other amounts due to the Executive pursuant to this Plan. 11. ERISA. This Plan is an unfunded compensation arrangement for a member of a select group of the Company's management or that of its subsidiaries and any exemptions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, as applicable to such an arrangement shall be applicable to this Plan. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.01 Administration. This Plan may be administered by the Board or the Committee. When this Plan refers to any action by the Board, the Committee may take such action with the same effect as if it had been taken by the Board. 12.02 Amendments. This Plan may be changed, amended or modified by resolution of the Board or the Committee. 12.03 Assignment and Binding Effect. (a) Neither this Plan nor the rights or obligations hereunder shall be assignable by the Executive or the Company except that this Plan shall be assignable to, binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company, and any successor shall be deemed substituted for the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof'. (b) The Company will require any successor (whether by purchase of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform all of the obligations of the Company under this Plan (including the obligation to cause any subsequent successor to also assume the obligations of this Plan) unless such assumption occurs by operation of law. Nothing in this Section 12.03 is intended, however, to require that a person or group referred to in Section 2.03(a) as being the beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Company must assume the obligations under this Plan as a result of such stock ownership. 12.04 No Waiver. No waiver of any term, provision or condition of this Plan, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, provision or condition or as a waiver of any other term, provision or condition of this Plan. 12.05 Rules of Construction. (a) This Plan has been executed in, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of, the State of California. Captions contained in this Plan are for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered or referred to in resolving questions of interpretation with respect to this Plan. 12
(b) If any provision of this Plan is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Plan will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision will be fully severable, (ii) this Plan will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of this Plan will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Plan a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 12.06 Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this Plan shall be in writing, delivered by hand, or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized courier service (regularly providing proof of delivery), addressed to the Board and the Company and where applicable, the Administrator, at the Company's then principal office, or to the Executive at the address set forth in the records of the Employer, as the case may be, or to such other address or addresses the Company or the Executive may from time to time specify in writing.

LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Apr. 27, 2006  Western Digital Corp.

"Providing customers with high quality, cost-effective hard drives at capacity points they require  when they need them  is of tremendous value in all the markets that we serve: notebook, consumer electronics, enterprise, branded products and desktop.

If such resignation is conditioned upon Board acceptance, the Governance Comm ittee of the Board of Directors will evaluate the resignation in light of the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the recommendation of the Governance Committee and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors or Governance Committee. However, if no directors receive the requisite majority vote in an uncontested election, the incumbent Board will nominate a new slate of directors and will hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing new directors within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote at the prior meeting. In this circumstance, the Board of Directors will continue to serve unti l new directors are elected and qualified. The Bylaws, as amended, are effective as of May 10, 2006 and are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.3. In addition, a copy of the press release announcing the Board of Director's adoption of a majority voting standard for director elections is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board or (C) by any stockholder of this Corporation who was a stockholder of record of this Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a proposal or director nomination to be considered at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2005 Annual Meeting"), stockholders must give written notice of any proposal or nomination of a director to the Secretary of this Corporation at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 120 days prior to the scheduled date of the 2005 Annual Meeting, regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of the 2005 Annual Meeting to a later date. The 2005 Annual Meeting is currently scheduled for November 17, 2005. Stockholder proposals or nominations for director that do not meet the notice requirements set forth above will not be acted upon at the 2005 Annual Meeting.
(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 2.11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of this Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by this Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (1) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (2) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on this Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of this Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of this Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.11 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified this Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by this Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. This Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of this Corporation.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by this Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.11 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by this Corporation.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of this Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. In the event this Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in this Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of this Section 2.11) and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.11, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by this Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(ii) For purposes of this Section 2.11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by this Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.11.

The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of this Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered.

2.12
Conduct of Meetings.
Subject to the requirements of the General Corporation Law, the property, business and affairs of this Corporation shall be managed by the Board.
3.01
General Powers
.
The Board shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. Directors need not be stockholders. Each of the directors of this Corporation shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws.
3.02
Number and Term of Office
.
The directors shall be elected annually by the stockholders of this Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.05 below, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at any annual or special meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, up to the number of directors to be elected, shall be the directors. For purposes of this Section 3.03, a "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. If an incumbent director is not reelected but would otherwise remain in office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board, which may be conditioned upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board. If a resignation is so conditioned, the Governance Committee of the Board, or such other committee designated by the Board pursuant to Section 3.14 below, will evaluate any such resignation in light of the best interests of this Corporation and its stockholders and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject such resignation or whether other action should be taken with respect thereto. In making its recommendation, such committee may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to this Corporation, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause this Corporation to fail to satisfy or otherwise comply with any applicable rule or regulation (including NYSE listing requirements and federal securities laws). The Board will act on the recommendation of such committee and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board or Board committee.
3.03
Election of Directors
.
If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the election of directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, the incumbent Board will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote at the prior meeting. In this circumstance, the incumbent Board will continue to serve until new directors are duly elected and qualified.
Any director of this Corporation may resign at any time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board or to the Secretary of this Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or, if the time be not specified, it shall take effect immediately upon its receipt by the Board or the Secretary; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
3.04
Resignations
.
Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancy in the Board, whether because of death, resignation, disqualification, an increase in the number of directors, or any other cause, may be filled by vote of the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders. Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by the General Corporation Law.
3.05
Vacancies
.
The Board may hold any of its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board may from time to time by resolution designate or as shall be designated by the person or persons calling the meeting or in the notice or a waiver of notice of any such meeting. Directors may participate in any regular or special meeting of the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment pursuant to which all persons participating in the meeting of the Board can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
3.06
Place of Meeting, Etc
.
The Board shall meet as soon as practicable after each annual election of directors and notice of such first meeting shall not be required, provided a quorum shall be present; or such meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board, or as shall be specified in a waiver given by each person entitled to notice.
3.07
First Meeting
.
Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and places as the Board shall from time to time by resolution determine. If any day fixed for a regular meeting shall be a legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday.
3.08
Regular Meetings
.
Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or any two directors.

3.09
Special Meetings

3.11
Action by Consent

Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, any director may be removed at any time, either with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the stockholders then entitled to vote at an election of directors having a majority of the voting power of this Corporation given at an annual meeting or a special meeting of the stockholders called for such purpose.
3.12
Removal of Directors
.
The directors shall receive only such compensation for their services as directors as may be allowed by resolution of the Board. The Board may also provide that this Corporation shall reimburse each such director for any expense incurred by such director on account of his or her attendance at any meetings of the Board or committees of the Board. Neither the payment of such compensation nor the reimbursement of such expenses shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this Corporation or its subsidiaries in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

The option (the "Option") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement (the "Notice") was issued under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Stock Options - Executives (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The holder of the Option is referred to herein as the "Participant." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of these Standard Terms, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan the grant date of the Option.
after
The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan.
The Notice indicates whether the Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option (an "ISO") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or is a nonqualified stock option (an option that is not an ISO). ISOs are subject to additional requirements under the Code as generally described in Section 5.1 of the Plan. If the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs (whether granted under the Option or otherwise) first become exercisable by the Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, as measured on the applicable option grant dates and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the limitations of Section 5.1.2 of the Plan shall apply and to such extent the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option.
4. Vesting
The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in the Notice. The first vesting installment of the Option shall be a fixed installment covering the number of shares, and vesting on the fixed vesting date, set forth in the first line of the Notice under "Vesting." In each case, the Option is subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, to the extent that the Option is outstanding and otherwise unvested immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Option shall vest and become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Change in Control Event. This acceleration provision shall not in any way limit the Corporation's ability to terminate the Option in connection with a Change in Control Event as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan; provided that, in any such circumstances, the Optionee is given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise the outstanding portion of the Option in accordance with its terms (subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting) before the termination of the Option in such circumstances (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of accelerated vesting and the impending termination be required and any acceleration may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event).
The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated.
The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 6 below or under the Plan.
The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 6 below, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option.
The Option shall be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her permitted successor in interest) following the Participant's termination of employment only to the extent provided below in this Section 6. Except as provided in Section 6(f) below, the last day that the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to a period of non-employment by any such entity is referred to as the Participant's "Severance Date." In each case described below, the Option shall be subject to earlier termination as contemplated by Section 5.
(a) . In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason (other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause (as defined below), due to the Participant's death or Retirement (as defined below), or at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled (as defined below)), the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date and, to the extent that the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three months following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-month period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-month period.
Termination of Employment Generally
(b) . In the event that the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled and is not eligible to Retire, the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date. In such circumstances, or in the event that the Participant incurs such a Total Disability within not more than three months of the Participant's Severance Date if the termination of the Participant's employment was for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option may, to the extent the Option was exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, be exercised by the Participant (or, if the Participant is then incapacitated, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs, or legatees) at any time during the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period. For purposes of the Option, "Total Disability" (which term shall include "Totally Disabled") means a "permanent and total disability" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
Total Disability
(c) . If the Participant dies while he or she is an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable, at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period.
Death
(d) . If the Participant Retires from the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant (or if the Participant is then deceased, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable) at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Retired Participant provides services to a competitor of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, consultant, director, officer, representative, independent contractor or otherwise, or otherwise competes with the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (in each case as determined by the Administrator its sole discretion), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall immediately terminate. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Participant as a result of any exercise of the Option during the six-month period prior to the date such Retired Participant commenced providing such services to a competitor. For this purpose, the Participant shall be deemed to have "Retired" (which term shall include "Retirement," "Retire" and "Retires") if the Participant retires from employment with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than Cause after satisfying all of the following at the time of such retirement: (i) the Participant is at least 65 years of age, (ii) the Participant's age plus total years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) totals at least 75, and (iii) the Participant has five (5) or more years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) ending on the date of such retirement. For purposes of calculating "age plus total years of continuous service" under clause (ii) above, fractional years shall be disregarded but may be cumulated (so that, by way of example only, a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 6 months of continuous service would satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), while a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 5 months of continuous service would not satisfy the requirements of clause (ii)). For purposes of calculating the Participant's "years of continuous service" under clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, in no event shall the Participant accrue more than one year of service with respect to any period of twelve consecutive months (that is, concurrent employment by both the Corporation and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by multiple Subsidiaries, for a month shall not be counted as more than one month of service).
Retirement
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, if the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option (whether or not all or any portion of such Option is then vested and exercisable) shall immediately terminate on the Participant's Severance Date.
Termination for Cause
For purposes of this Section 6 and as to any termination of employment or services that occurs prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by the Administrator or its delegate or delegates in its or their sole discretion:
(i) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved;
nolo contendre
(ii) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions;
(iii) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer;
(iv) negligence, insubordination, violation by the Participant of any duty (loyalty or otherwise) owed to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other misconduct on the part of the Participant;
(v) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Administrator's (or its delegate's or delegates') reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(vi) sexual harassment by the Participant that has been reasonably substantiated and investigated;
(vii) involvement in activities representing conflicts of interest with the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(viii) improper disclosure of confidential information;
(ix) conduct endangering, or likely to endanger, the health or safety of another employee;
(x) falsifying or misrepresenting information on the records of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(xi) the Participant's physical destruction or theft of substantial property or assets of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(xii) breach of any policy of, or agreement with, the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates applicable to the Participant or to which the Participant is otherwise bound.
For purposes of this Section 6 and as to any termination of employment or services that occurs after the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board:
(A) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved;
nolo contendre
(B) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions which results directly or indirectly in any demonstrable material financial or economic harm to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(C) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer, provided that the Participant shall have first received written notice from the employer stating with specificity the nature of such failure or refusal and affording the Participant at least five (5) days to correct the act or omission complained of;
(D) gross negligence, insubordination, material violation by the Participant of any duty of loyalty to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other material misconduct on the part of the Participant, provided that the Participant shall have first received written notice from the Corporation stating with specificity the nature of such action or violation and affording the Participant at least five (5) days to correct such action or violation;
(E) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Board's reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;

(f) . If the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries terminates (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, the Participant continues to render services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, director or consultant, such Participant's Severance Date for purposes of the Option shall not be the date such Participant's employment terminates, but instead shall be the last day that the Participant either is employed by or actually renders services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. As provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of the Option of whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated.
Continuation of Services
(g) . Notwithstanding any post-termination exercise period provided for herein or in the Plan, the Option will qualify as an ISO only if it is exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs under, and meets all of the other requirements of, the Code. If the Option is not exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs or does not meet such other requirements, the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option.
Exercise Period for ISOs
The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of:
The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator.
The Option will qualify as an ISO only if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Code.
The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan.
Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation.
Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof.
Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.
Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Option or the Participant's employment, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure  1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Option Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Option, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 12).
This Option Agreement, including these Standard Terms, shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law.
14. Severability
If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Option Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Option Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder.
15. Entire Agreement
This Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.
16. Section Headings
The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.

The option (the "Option") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement (the "Notice") was issued under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions for Stock Options (these "Standard Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Standard Terms, the Plan or these Standard Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Standard Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The holder of the Option is referred to herein as the "Participant." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of these Standard Terms, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan the grant date of the Option.
after
The Notice and these Standard Terms, together, constitute the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan.
The Notice indicates whether the Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option (an "ISO") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or is a nonqualified stock option (an option that is not an ISO). ISOs are subject to additional requirements under the Code as generally described in Section 5.1 of the Plan. If the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs (whether granted under the Option or otherwise) first become exercisable by the Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, as measured on the applicable option grant dates and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the limitations of Section 5.1.2 of the Plan shall apply and to such extent the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option.
4. Vesting
The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in the Notice. The first vesting installment of the Option shall be a fixed installment covering the number of shares, and vesting on the fixed vesting date, set forth in the first line of the Notice under "Vesting." In each case, the Option is subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5.
The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated.
The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 6 below or under the Plan.
The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 6 below, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option.
The Option shall be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her permitted successor in interest) following the Participant's termination of employment only to the extent provided below in this Section 6. Except as provided in Section 6(f) below, the last day that the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to a period of non-employment by any such entity is referred to as the Participant's "Severance Date." In each case described below, the Option shall be subject to earlier termination as contemplated by Section 5.
(a) . In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason (other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause (as defined below), due to the Participant's death or Retirement (as defined below), or at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled (as defined below)), the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date and, to the extent that the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three months following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-month period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-month period.
Termination of Employment Generally
(b) . In the event that the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled and is not eligible to Retire, the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date. In such circumstances, or in the event that the Participant incurs such a Total Disability within not more than three months of the Participant's Severance Date if the termination of the Participant's employment was for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option may, to the extent the Option was exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, be exercised by the Participant (or, if the Participant is then incapacitated, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs, or legatees) at any time during the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period. For purposes of the Option, "Total Disability" (which term shall include "Totally Disabled") means a "permanent and total disability" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
Total Disability
(c) . If the Participant dies while he or she is an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable, at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period.
Death
(d) . If the Participant Retires from the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant (or if the Participant is then deceased, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable) at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Retired Participant provides services to a competitor of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, consultant, director, officer, representative, independent contractor or otherwise, or otherwise competes with the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (in each case as determined by the Administrator its sole discretion), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall immediately terminate. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Participant as a result of any exercise of the Option during the six-month period prior to the date such Retired Participant commenced providing such services to a competitor. For this purpose, the Participant shall be deemed to have "Retired" (which term shall include "Retirement," "Retire" and "Retires") if the Participant retires from employment with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than Cause after satisfying all of the following at the time of such retirement: (i) the Participant is at least 65 years of age, (ii) the Participant's age plus total years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) totals at least 75, and (iii) the Participant has five (5) or more years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) ending on the date of such retirement. For purposes of calculating "age plus total years of continuous service" under clause (ii) above, fractional years shall be disregarded but may be cumulated (so that, by way of example only, a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 6 months of continuous service would satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), while a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 5 months of continuous service would not satisfy the requirements of clause (ii)). For purposes of calculating the Participant's "years of continuous service" under clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, in no event shall the Participant accrue more than one year of service with respect to any period of twelve consecutive months (that is, concurrent employment by both the Corporation and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by multiple Subsidiaries, for a month shall not be counted as more than one month of service).
Retirement
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, if the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option (whether or not all or any portion of such Option is then vested and exercisable) shall immediately terminate on the Participant's Severance Date. For these purposes, the term "Cause" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any of the following with respect to the Participant, as determined by the Administrator or its delegate or delegates in its or their sole discretion:
Termination for Cause
(i) the Participant's conviction by, or entry of a plea of guilty or in, a court of competent and final jurisdiction for any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony punishable by imprisonment in the jurisdiction involved;
nolo contendre
(ii) whether prior or subsequent to the date hereof, the Participant's willful engaging in dishonest or fraudulent actions or omissions;
(iii) the Participant's failure or refusal to perform his or her duties as reasonably required by his or her employer;
(iv) negligence, insubordination, violation by the Participant of any duty (loyalty or otherwise) owed to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other misconduct on the part of the Participant;
(v) the repeated non-prescription use of any controlled substance, or the repeated use of alcohol or any other non-controlled substance which in the Administrator's (or its delegate's or delegates') reasonable determination interferes with the Participant's service as an officer or employee of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(vi) sexual harassment by the Participant that has been reasonably substantiated and investigated;
(vii) involvement in activities representing conflicts of interest with the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(viii) improper disclosure of confidential information;
(ix) conduct endangering, or likely to endanger, the health or safety of another employee;
(x) falsifying or misrepresenting information on the records of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(xi) the Participant's physical destruction or theft of substantial property or assets of the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates;
(xii) breach of any policy of, or agreement with, the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates applicable to the Participant or to which the Participant is otherwise bound.
(f) . If the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries terminates (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, the Participant continues to render services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, director or consultant, such Participant's Severance Date for purposes of the Option shall not be the date such Participant's employment terminates, but instead shall be the last day that the Participant either is employed by or actually renders services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. As provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of the Option of whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated.
Continuation of Services
(g) . Notwithstanding any post-termination exercise period provided for herein or in the Plan, the Option will qualify as an ISO only if it is exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs under, and meets all of the other requirements of, the Code. If the Option is not exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs or does not meet such other requirements, the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option.
Exercise Period for ISOs
The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of:
The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator.
The Option will qualify as an ISO only if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Code.
The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan.
Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation.
Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof.
Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.
Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Option or the Participant's employment, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure  1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Option Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Option, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 12).
This Option Agreement, including these Standard Terms, shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law.
14. Severability
If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Option Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Option Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder.
This Option Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.
16. Section Headings
The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  May 16, 2006  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today announced that its board of directors has amended the company's bylaws to adopt a majority voting standard for the election of directors. Under the new majority voting standard, which replaces plurality voting for uncontested elections, a director nominee will be elected to the company's board only if the director receives a majority of the total votes cast with respect to the director. In contested elections, directors will continue to be elected by a plurality vote.
The board of directors has also adopted a director resignation policy in the company's bylaws to address the "holdover rule" that applies in the state of Delaware, where the company is incorporated. Under Delaware law, an incumbent director who is not re-elected to the board will continue to serve as a holdover director until the director's successor is elected and qualified or until the director's earlier resignation or removal. The director resignation policy adopted by the board of directors will require an incumbent director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast to tender his or her resignation to the board. If the resignation is conditioned on board acceptance, the governance committee will evaluate the resignation and will make a recommendation to the board on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The board will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days of the certification of election results.
Additional information regarding the company's corporate governance is available at http://www.wdc.com/en/company/governance.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In meetings with investors and analysts and at an investment conference this week, Company executives will provide investors with updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  Demand in the desktop and notebook hard drive markets in the June quarter is seasonally soft.  Demand in the PVR/DVR market is helping to partially mitigate the quarters seasonality.  Pricing in the quarter is also exhibiting anticipated seasonal trends, albeit at the higher end of historical declines.  Weeks of inventory in the distribution channel for the industry and for the Company are being well managed, within the long-stated acceptable range of 4 to 6 weeks.  Historically, June quarter shipment patterns are more back-end loaded than other quarters. As a result, business in the remainder of the quarter will determine the Companys June quarter financial performance.  The Companys new technology programs continue to progress on plan.  Supply of media is anticipated to remain tightglass more so than aluminum-- through at least the balance of this calendar year.  The Company believes the long term fundamentals and drivers for growth for the hard drive industry and for WD, continue to be in excellent shape.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning the Companys expectations regarding demand in the desktop and notebook hard drive markets, pricing, inventory and the effects of seasonality in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the progress of the Companys new technology programs, the Company's expectations regarding the supply of media and its beliefs regarding the industry's and the Company's long term fundamentals and drivers for growth. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in availability and cost of specialized product components, including media ; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and the successful expansion into new hard disk drive markets, including the 2.5-inch and sub 2.5-inch markets; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes; business conditions and growth in the desktop, 2.5-inch notebook, consumer electronics, handheld, SATA and enterprise markets; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Companys most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.

At a meeting on June 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board established the performance goals for the cash bonus awards under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP Plan") for the first half of fiscal year 2007. The Compensation Committee determined that funding of the ICP Plan for this period will be based upon accomplishment of specific revenue targets and earnings per share targets, in various combinations. Under the ICP Plan, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees may be awarded cash bonus awards based on the Companys achievement of these predetermined performance goals. For executive officers, a target bonus amount has been established as a percentage of base salary ranging from 65% to 100% of base salary. Depending upon the Companys achievement of these predetermined performance goals, the ICP Plan may fund based on a percentage of the target bonus amount (ranging from 0% to 200% of the target). However, individual participation in the ICP Plan is based on individual performance, and actual awards may vary upward or downward.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jul. 27, 2006  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $1.1 billion on shipments of approximately 19.2 million hard drives, and net income of $119.9 million, or $.53 per share for its fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006. Net income included approximately $35 million in favorable adjustments. Revenue increased 15 percent over the fourth quarter of the prior year, and net income, including the favorable adjustments, increased 191 percent, versus revenue of $940 million and net income of $41.2 million, respectively. Net income in the prior year fourth quarter was negatively affected by a $19 million expense for settlement of a lawsuit.
     The favorable adjustments in net income in the fourth quarter included a $13 million benefit to gross margin related to the resolution of certain items that impacted amounts previously recorded as costs, and a $22 million benefit to income taxes related to an adjustment to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.

     Western Digital also announced in a separate press release today that it has appointed a Special Committee of its Board of Directors that is conducting a company-initiated, voluntary review of its historical stock option grants. The Special Committee has hired independent counsel and is reviewing option grants from fiscal year 1998 to the present. While the Special Committee has not completed its review, a preliminary determination has been made that measurement dates for accounting purposes may differ from recorded dates used for certain grants made from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2003. The company does not at present anticipate a material adjustment to the operating results included in this release. However, depending on the results of the Special Committee's review, a material adjustment to the company's financial statements could be required. The company has informed the Securities and Exchange Commission that its historical stock option grants are being reviewed. The company will provide a public statement once its review is complete.
     WD also separately announced today that it is in volume production of 2.5-inch mobile hard drives with 80 gigabyte-per-platter perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology and of 3.5-inch desktop hard drives utilizing 160 gigabyte-per-platter technology. Both product families utilize heads designed and manufactured by WD.
     "Our results in the June quarter demonstrate WD's ability to post consistently strong financial performance and they represent a noteworthy achievement during the industry's slower season," said Arif Shakeel, chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We performed well in the high volume desktop market and showed significant progress in our two major growth markets3.5-inch drives for consumer electronics (CE) and 2.5-inch drives for notebook PCs.
     "Several years ago, we established revenue diversification as a key strategic objective in order to leverage our resources into an expanding array of hard drive applications and fast-
 
WD Caps Strong Year with Q4 Revenue of $1.1 Billion and Net Income of $.53 per Share, including $35 Million in Favorable Adjustments Page 3
growing markets," Shakeel said. "We continued to make excellent progress in addressing these opportunities in the fourth quarter: 34 percent of revenue came from new markets for WD such as CE and mobile drives, while 66 percent came from the desktop PC market. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 23 percent new market revenue and 77 percent desktop PC revenue."
     Demonstrating this trend, shipments of 3.5-inch hard drives for CE devices such as digital and personal video recorders expanded to 2.2 million units in the June quarter while 2.5-inch mobile hard drive shipments grew to 1.6 million, with both categories showing strong year-over-year and sequential growth.
     Commenting on the company's volume production of 2.5-inch mobile hard drives with 80 gigabyte-per-platter PMR technology and of 3.5-inch desktop hard drives utilizing 160 gigabyte per-platter technology, Shakeel said: "These technology achievements represent a continued return on investment from our substantial technology spending over the last four years. We are deploying both technologies at a time when we can maximize the critical balance of cost, reliability, quality, availability, and our customers' needs."
     The company's results for its full year ended June 30, 2006, reflected strong year-over-year performance, with revenue of $4.3 billion, net income of $396 million, and earnings per share of $1.77. Net income for the full year included the $22 million adjustment related to deferred income taxes. These results represent increases in revenue of 19 percent and in net income of 100 percent, including the favorable adjustment, compared with fiscal 2005. For the prior year, net income was $198 million, or $.91 per share.
 
WD Caps Strong Year with Q4 Revenue of $1.1 Billion and Net Income of $.53 per Share, including $35 Million in Favorable Adjustments Page 4
     From a balance sheet perspective, WD generated over $400 million in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2006, and ended the year with $699 million of cash and short-term investments, an increase of 17 percent from the prior fiscal year.
     "Our fiscal-year performance reflects a sustained track record by WD of executing in all aspects of our operations and of delivering outstanding financial results throughout all seasons in the dynamic hard drive industry," said Shakeel. "We remain focused on executing to our business model as we address the multiple growth market opportunities for high-volume suppliers in our industry."

Item 8.01 Other Events.
      Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced today that a Special Committee of its Board of Directors, comprised solely of independent directors, has reported the results of its findings after the completion of a three month, company-initiated, voluntary review of its historical stock option grants. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
      The Special Committee, together with independent counsel and forensic accountants, reviewed all option grants of the Company during the period from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2006. The Special Committee's advisors also reviewed more than 220,000 electronic documents and interviewed 35 current and former employees and directors.
      The Special Committee identified, and the Company concluded, that the appropriate measurement date for 28 option grants made on 27 separate grant dates during the period from fiscal 1998 through fiscal 2003 differed from the originally stated grant dates for such awards. Because the prices at the originally stated grant dates were, for 19 of such grants, lower than the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants, the Company determined it should have recognized stock-based compensation expense and additional tax expense in its historical financial statements for these 19 grants. For the remaining 9 grants, since the prices at the originally stated grant dates were at or above the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants, the Company determined that no accounting adjustment should be made for these grants.
Special Committee Findings
      Key findings from the Special Committee's investigation include:
Table of Contents
Remedial Actions and Reporting
      The Special Committee concluded that while process improvements had been made in the Company's grant making process since 2002, additional improvements in controls and procedures over stock option grants were needed and the Special Committee made recommendations to the Board for such improvements. The Board adopted all of these recommendations and these changes are being made. In response to the Special Committee's findings and recommendations, the Board also made a change in the composition of its Compensation and Governance Committees and to oversight of the administration of the stock option granting process. With respect to the change in the composition of the Board committees, Mr. Peter D.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On October 31, 2006, Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital") entered into (1) an employment agreement with John Coyne (the "Coyne Employment Agreement") pursuant to which Mr. Coyne will become the Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital, effective January 2, 2007, and (ii) an amendment (the "Amendment") to the employment agreement with Arif Shakeel (the "Shakeel Employment Agreement") pursuant to which Mr. Shakeel will relinquish the role of Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital effective January 2, 2007 but will continue to be employed by Western Digital as Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer through June 29, 2007. A press release making this announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
John Coyne Employment Agreement
     Pursuant to the Coyne Employment Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference, Mr. Coyne will continue to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer until January 1, 2007. Effective January 2, 2007, Mr. Coyne will become President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital. The Coyne Employment Agreement terminates on January 1, 2012, subject to earlier termination in certain circumstances.
     The Coyne Employment Agreement provides for Mr. Coyne to receive base salary at the annual rate of $650,000 until January 1, 2007, at which time the annual rate of Mr. Coyne's base salary will increase to $800,000. Mr. Coyne's target annual bonus will be 100% of his base salary, and he will be entitled to participate in Western Digital's other benefit plans on terms consistent with those generally applicable to Western Digital's other senior executives.
     Pursuant to the Coyne Employment Agreement, Mr. Coyne has been granted two performance cash awards, each that provide for a cash bonus opportunity with a target amount of $1,000,000. One cash award corresponds to the performance period July 1, 2006 through June 29, 2007 and the other cash award corresponds to the performance period July 1, 2006 through June 27, 2008. The performance cash awards are each subject to the Notice of Grant of Long-Term Cash Award and Long-Term Cash Award Agreement  Executives in substantially the form previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the corresponding performance objectives for each award will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its good faith discretion. The Coyne Employment Agreement also provides that annually during Mr. Coyne's employment as President and Chief Executive Officer commencing after the first day of fiscal year 2008, Mr. Coyne will be eligible for and will receive a performance cash award with a target amount of no less than $2,000,000. Each such performance cash award shall be based upon a 24-month performance cycle. The corresponding performance objectives for each such award will be determined each year by mutual agreement of Mr. Coyne and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors following good faith discussions and consideration of Western Digital's strategic and operational initiatives or, if no such agreement is made, by the Compensation Committee in its good faith discretion. In addition, each such performance cash award will be subject to the Notice of Grant of Long-Term Cash Award and Long-Term Cash Award Agreement  Executives in substantially the form previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Pursuant to the Coyne Employment Agreement, effective as of January 31, 2007 and subject to Mr. Coyne's employment as President and Chief Executive Officer as of such date, Mr. Coyne will be granted 1,100,000 restricted stock units under Western Digital's amended and restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan, evidenced by a Notice of Grant of Stock Units and Stock Unit Award Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Mr. Coyne's continued employment by Western Digital, the stock units will become vested as follows: (i) 110,000 stock units will vest on January 1, 2008, (ii) 110,000 stock units will vest on January 1, 2009, (iii) 330,000 stock units will vest on January 1, 2010, (iv) 110,000 stock units will vest on January 1, 2011 and (v) 440,000 stock units will vest on January 1, 2012. The Coyne Employment Agreement also provides that, on January 31, 2007, Western Digital will grant Mr. Coyne a nonqualified stock option to purchase 120,000 shares of Western Digital common stock (subject to proportionate and equitable adjustments for stock splits and similar changes in capitalization). The exercise price per share of the option will equal the fair market value of a share of Western Digital's common stock on the date of grant of the option. The
Table of Contents
option will be granted under Western Digital's amended and restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan and will be evidenced by a Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding the prior approval of the restricted stock unit award or the stock option award, if Western Digital is in a trading blackout period (pursuant to Western Digital's policies on trading company securities applicable to executive officers generally) on January 31, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, delay the effective date of grant of either or both of the restricted stock unit award or the stock option until after the blackout period ends, in which case such delayed grant shall be made effective by approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors promptly following the end of the blackout period (and the date of grant of the option will be the date of such approval).
     In addition, pursuant to the Coyne Employment Agreement, in each of the four fiscal years commencing with fiscal year 2008, Mr. Coyne will receive a stock option to purchase shares of Western Digital's common stock. The number of shares subject to such stock options will be determined in the good faith discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based on Mr. Coyne's individual performance, Western Digital's performance and market benchmark comparisons of compensation data for chief executive officers against both peer group and general industry survey data.
     If Western Digital terminates Mr. Coyne's employment other than for cause (as defined in the Coyne Employment Agreement) (and not on account of Mr. Coyne's death or total disability) prior to January 1, 2012, Mr. Coyne will be entitled to (i) the Tier I benefits under Western Digital's then-existing Executive Severance Plan or, if applicable, the benefits under Western Digital's Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan (provided that Mr. Coyne satisfies all of the terms and conditions of the applicable plan) and (ii) timely payment of all accrued obligations (as defined in the Coyne Agreement and which includes annual base salary and vacation accrued through the termination date to the extent not previously paid and any compensation previously deferred by Mr. Coyne in accordance with Western Digital's deferred compensation plan).
     In the event that Mr. Coyne remains employed by Western Digital as its President and Chief Executive Officer through January 1, 2012, then upon the termination of Mr. Coyne's employment with Western Digital for any reason (other than a termination for cause), any stock options granted to Mr. Coyne during the term of the Coyne Employment Agreement will become fully vested and Mr. Coyne will have three years from the date of such termination to exercise the options (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity incentive plan under which the options were granted and the agreement(s) evidencing such options). In addition, Mr. Coyne will be eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of any outstanding performance cash award based on the period of Mr. Coyne's employment by the Company during the applicable performance period.
Amendment to Arif Shakeel Employment Agreement
     Pursuant to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference, Mr. Shakeel will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital through January 1, 2007. Mr. Shakeel will relinquish the role of Chief Executive Officer effective January 2, 2007 but will continue to be employed by Western Digital as Special Advisor to the Chief Executive through June 29, 2007, subject to earlier termination in certain circumstances. Mr. Shakeel's duties as Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer will include offering advice and counsel to Mr. Coyne in his new position as Chief Executive Officer with respect to strategic, management and operational matters. Mr. Shakeel will continue to receive base salary at his current annual rate of $800,000 during such term of employment.
     The Amendment provides that, subject to Mr. Shakeel's continued employment through June 29, 2007, 158,333 shares of restricted stock that comprise a portion of the January 20, 2005 restricted stock award to Mr. Shakeel that are scheduled to vest on July 31, 2007 will instead become vested on June 29, 2007, and 659,200 shares of restricted stock that comprise a portion of the August 25, 2005 restricted stock award to Mr. Shakeel that are scheduled to vest on January 1, 2008 will instead become vested on June 29, 2007.
     The Amendment also provides that the stock options previously granted to Mr. Shakeel and outstanding as of October 31, 2006 that are scheduled to vest after June 29, 2007 and before January 1, 2008 terminated effective October 31, 2006.

On January 31, 2007, and in each of the four fiscal years commencing with fiscal year 2008, the Company shall grant to Executive a nonqualified stock option (the "Option(s)") to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "D". The date of the Option grants subsequent to January 2007 shall be at the same time as the Company's annual grant of options to other members of senior management. If the Company is in a blackout period (pursuant to the Company's policies on trading Company securities applicable to the Company's executive officers generally) on the applicable date, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, delay the date of grant of the applicable Option until after such blackout period ends, in which case the Compensation Committee shall approve the grant promptly following the end of such blackout period (and the date of grant of the Option shall be the date of such approval). The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the January 31, 2007 Option will equal 120,000 (such number subject to proportionate and equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, and similar changes in capitalization). The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the subsequent Options will be determined in the good faith discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based on (among such other facts and circumstances the Compensation Committee may determine to be relevant in the circumstances) Executive's individual performance, the Company's performance, and market benchmark comparisons of compensation data for chief executive officers against both peer group and general industry survey data. The exercise 3
price per share of the Option(s) will be equal to the fair market value (determined consistently with the Company's Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan) of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the Option(s). The Option(s) will be evidenced by and subject to such other and further terms and conditions as set forth in a written stock option award agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "D". C. Future Award Eligibility. Executive shall also be eligible to receive additional grants of stock options, restricted stock awards, and/or other long-term incentives, each in the good faith discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based on (among such other facts and circumstances the Compensation Committee may determine to be relevant in the circumstances) Executive's individual performance, the Company's performance, and market benchmark comparisons of compensation data for chief executive officers against both peer group and general industry survey data. D. Special Incentive Vesting and Exercisability. In the event Executive remains employed by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer through January 1, 2012, following the termination of Executive's employment with the Company (regardless of the reason, other than a termination by the Company for Cause (as defined in Section 5)), Executive will (i) be fully vested in any stock options granted to him by the Company during the Employment Period and Executive will have three years from the date of such termination to exercise such stock options (subject to earlier termination on the expiration of the maximum applicable term of such stock options or, as provided in the applicable agreement evidencing such options and the equity incentive plan of the Company under which they are granted, the occurrence of a change in control of the Company and similar events) and (ii) be eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of any outstanding Performance Cash Award equal to the amount that Executive would have been entitled to had he continued to be employed through the applicable payment date, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the performance period that Executive was employed by the Company and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the performance period. Any such payment(s) shall be made at the same time as amounts are paid generally with respect to the applicable performance period. 5. TERMINATION. A. Death. This Agreement and Executive's employment shall terminate automatically on the death of Executive. B. Disability. The Company, at its option, may terminate Executive's employment upon the Disability of Executive. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean physical or mental incapacity that renders Executive unable to perform the normal and customary duties of employment of Executive even with a reasonable accommodation for (A) 120 days in any twelve (12) month period or (B) for a period of ninety (90) successive days. 4
C. Cause. The Company may terminate Executive's employment for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean that the Company, acting in good faith based upon the information then known to the Company, determines that Executive has engaged in or committed: (i) willful misconduct, (ii) fraud, (iii) failure or refusal to perform the duties of Chief Operating Officer and President prior to January 2, 2007, or President and Chief Executive Officer on or after January 2, 2007, as the case may be, or (iv) a conviction of or a plea of nolo contendre to a felony. D. Other than Cause, Death, or Disability. The Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time, with or without cause, upon 30 days' written notice. E. Obligations of the Company Upon Termination. (i) Cause or Disability. If Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or on account of Disability, Executive's employment shall terminate without further obligations to Executive other than for the timely payment of the sum of (i) Executive's annual base salary through the date of termination to the extent not theretofore paid and (ii) any compensation previously deferred by Executive in accordance with the Company's deferred compensation plans (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan) and any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"). If it is subsequently determined that the Company did not have Cause for termination under Section 5.C or Executive was not Disabled as defined in Section 5.B, then the Company's decision to terminate shall be deemed to have been made under Section 5.D, and the amounts payable under Section 5.E(iii) shall be the only amounts Executive may receive for his termination. (ii) Death. If Executive's employment is terminated on account of Executive's Death, Executive's employment shall terminate without further obligations to Executive's heirs other than for the timely payment of Accrued Obligations and the adjusted vesting of Restricted Units set forth in Section 4.A above. (iii) Other than Cause, Death, or Disability. If the Company terminates Executive's employment for other than Cause (and other than due to Executive's death or Disability) effective prior to January 1, 2012, Executive's employment shall terminate without further obligations to Executive other than: (a) The Company's timely payment to Executive of Accrued Obligations; and (b) The Company's provision to Executive of the Tier I benefits under the Company's then-existing Executive Severance Plan or, if applicable, the benefits under the Company's Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan, provided that Executive satisfies all of the terms and conditions of the applicable 5
plan (including in the case of the Executive Severance Plan, but not limited to the condition that Executive execute a general release in a form acceptable to the Company). (iv) Expiration. Upon the expiration of this Agreement, Executive's employment shall terminate without further obligations to Executive other than (i) the timely payment of Accrued Obligations, (ii) any benefits or amounts due under Section 4(D) above, and (iii) eligibility to receive an ICP bonus with respect to the first half of fiscal year 2012 in such amount and at such time as ICP bonuses, if any, are determined on a Company-wide basis. F. Exclusive Remedy. Executive agrees that the payments and benefits contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute the exclusive and sole remedy for any termination of his employment, and Executive covenants not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at law or in equity, with respect to any termination of employment. 6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND INVENTION. Executive has previously executed an Employee Invention and Confidentiality Agreement ("Invention Agreement"), dated March 3, 1997, which is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. In the event of an inconsistency between a provision of this Agreement and a provision of the Invention Agreement, the provision of this Agreement controls. 7. NON-INTERFERENCE. Executive promises and agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter, he will not influence or attempt to influence any customer, supplier, or distributor of the Company to alter or reduce its business relationship with the Company. 8. LITIGATION ASSISTANCE. Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company in any actual or threatened litigation that arises against or brought by the Company at any time during or after the Employment Period, including but not limited to participating in interviews with the Company's counsel to assist the Company in any such litigation. 9. ARBITRATION. Any controversy arising out of or relating to Executive's employment, this Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of its provisions, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange County, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from ADR Services, Inc., and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Civil Procedure Code Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive remedy of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be 6
sought in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the Arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the Arbitrator deems just and equitable. Any award or relief granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement or Executive's employment. 10.

This Agreement shall not be modified by any oral agreement, either express or implied, and all modifications hereof shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. 13. SAVINGS CLAUSE. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable. 14. COMPLETE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (and all other agreements, exhibits, and schedules referred to in this Agreement, including without limitation the Invention Agreement) constitutes and contains the entire agreement and final understanding concerning Executive's employment with the Company and the other subject matters addressed herein between 7
the parties. It is intended by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their agreement.

These stock units were granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan").1 VESTING2: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your stock unit award is subject to the terms and conditions of this Notice, the attached Terms and Conditions for Stock Unit Awards (the "Terms") and the Plan. By accepting the award, you are agreeing to the terms of the award as set forth in those documents. You should read the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and the Terms. The Terms and the Plan are each incorporated into (made a part of) this Notice by this reference. You do not have to accept your award.

[WESTERN DIGITAL LOGO] Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Telephone 949 672-7000 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK UNIT AWARDS Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan 1. STOCK UNITS SUBJECT TO 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN The Stock Unit Award (the "Award") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Units and Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Notice") was awarded under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Each stock unit covered by the Award ("Stock Unit") is a non-voting unit of measurement that is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan). The holder of the Stock Units is referred to herein as the "Participant." Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the number of shares of Common Stock to eventually be delivered to the Participant if Stock Units held by such Participant vest pursuant to Section 4, Section 7 or Section 8 and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind. Stock Units granted to the Participant shall be credited to an unfunded bookkeeping account maintained by the Corporation on behalf of the Participant (a "Stock Unit Account"). The Stock Units are subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Terms and Conditions for Stock Unit Awards (these "Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Terms, the Plan or these Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 2. AWARD AGREEMENT The Notice and these Terms, together, constitute the Award Agreement with respect to the Award pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. DEFERRAL OF STOCK UNITS Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Participant may elect, on a form and in a manner provided by the Corporation, to defer the Stock Units subject to the Award under the Corporation's Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). If the Participant makes such a deferral election, the Stock Units will be paid (to the extent vested) in accordance with the payment provisions of the Deferred Compensation Plan (including without limitation the provisions requiring a six-month payment delay in the event that the Participant is a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code), which are incorporated herein by this reference, and any applicable deferral election made by the Participant under and in accordance with the rules of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Whether or not the Participant elects to defer the Stock Units, any shares of Common Stock issued or delivered with respect to the Stock Units shall be charged against the applicable share limits of the Plan. 4. VESTING Except as otherwise provided in this Award Agreement, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of Stock Units as set forth in the Notice.
An Award may vest and become payable in connection with the occurrence of certain events involving the Corporation as provided for in Section 7 of the Plan. Without limiting the foregoing but subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, to the extent that the Award is outstanding and otherwise unvested immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Award shall vest and become payable as to the outstanding and otherwise unvested Stock Units upon the occurrence of the Change in Control Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Award Agreement or the Plan, if the event giving rise to any accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan is not also a "change in control event" of the Corporation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, then payment with respect to the Award shall not be made until such Stock Units would have become vested and payable without regard to this Section 4 or Section 7 of the Plan. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7 below or under the Plan. 5. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS As of any date that the Corporation pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Corporation shall credit the Participant's Stock Unit Account with an additional number of Stock Units equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Corporation on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the number of Stock Units remaining subject to the Award as of the related dividend payment record date, divided by (iii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of payment of such dividend. If the Participant has not made a deferral election with respect to the Stock Units, then the Stock Units credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate. If the Participant has made a deferral election with respect to the Stock Units, then the Stock Units credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall be credited under, and paid in an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the payment provisions of, the Deferred Compensation Plan and any applicable deferral election made by the Participant under and in accordance with the rules of the Deferred Compensation Plan. 6. TIMING AND MANNER OF PAYMENT OF STOCK UNITS Except as provided in Section 3 or 4 above, on or within fifteen (15) business days following the vesting of any Stock Units granted (or credited pursuant to Section 5) to the Participant (whether pursuant to Section 4 or Section 7 hereof or Section 7 of the Plan), the Corporation shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units that vest on the applicable vesting date (including any Stock Units credited as dividend equivalents pursuant to Section 5 with respect to the Stock Units that vest), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7 of the Plan. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant (or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any shares with respect to the vested Stock Units) delivers to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid pursuant to this Section 6 or that are terminated pursuant to Section 7 hereof or Section 7 of the Plan, and such Stock Units shall be removed from the Participant's Stock Unit Account upon the date of such payment or termination. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, settle any Stock Units credited as dividend equivalents by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of payment (as opposed to payment in the form of shares of Common Stock). 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7 and subject to earlier vesting as provided in Section 4 and Section 8 hereof, if the Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or due to disability), the Participant's Stock Units shall be forfeited to the Corporation to the extent 2
such Stock Units have not become vested upon the date the Participant's employment or services terminate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event the Participant's employment by or services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated (i) on account of the Participant's death or (ii) by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without Cause (as such term is defined in that certain Employment Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Participant and the Corporation (the "Employment Agreement") (and not on account of the Participant's death or Disability (as such term is defined in the Employment Agreement)), a portion of the outstanding and otherwise unvested Stock Units shall automatically become vested as of such date of death or termination, as the case may be, as set forth in the remaining provisions of this Section 7, and shall be paid to the Participant's legal representative as provided in Section 6 above. In the event the date of the Participant's death is at a time when the Participant is employed by or providing services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the number of Stock Units that shall become vested on the date of the Participant's death equals: (a) the total number of Stock Units subject to the Award multiplied by a fraction (not greater than one), the numerator of which is the total number of calendar days during the period commencing on the date hereof through and including the date of the Participant's death (but not less than 182 days), and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days during the period commencing with the date hereof through and including January 1, 2012, less (b) the total number of Stock Units subject to the Award that otherwise vested on or before the date of the Participant's death. In the event the Participant's employment is terminated by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without Cause (and not on account of the Participant's death or Disability), the number of Stock Units that shall become vested on the date of such termination equals the number of Stock Units that are then scheduled to vest (assuming the Participant's employment did not terminate) during the six-month period following the date of such termination. The provisions of this Section 7 are not intended to supersede any rights or benefits to which the Participant may become entitled under the Corporation's Executive Severance Plan or Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan (collectively, the "Severance Plans"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Participant become entitled to any duplication of benefits under the Award Agreement and under the Severance Plans. 8. ADJUSTMENTS The Administrator may accelerate payment and vesting of the Stock Units in such circumstances as it, in its sole discretion, may determine. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Corporation's stock contemplated by Section 7.1 of the Plan, the Administrator will make adjustments if appropriate in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which dividend equivalents are paid pursuant to Section 5. 9. WITHHOLDING TAXES Upon or in connection with the vesting of the Stock Units, the payment of dividend equivalents and/or the distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Stock Units, the Corporation (or the Subsidiary last employing the Participant) shall have the right at its option to (a) require the Participant to pay or provide for payment in cash of the amount of any taxes that the Corporation or the Subsidiary may be required to withhold with respect to such vesting, payment and/or distribution, or (b) deduct from any amount payable to the Participant the amount of any taxes which the Corporation or the Subsidiary may be required to withhold with respect to such vesting, payment and/or distribution. In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Award Agreement, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, direct the Corporation or the Subsidiary to reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of whole shares, valued at their then fair market value (with the "fair market value" of such shares determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan), to satisfy such withholding obligation at the minimum applicable withholding rates. 10. NONTRANSFERABILITY Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated, encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 3
11. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 12. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Notice and these Terms, the Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5 with respect to dividend equivalent rights) and no voting rights with respect to Stock Units awarded to the Participant and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate. 13. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 13. 14. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Award Agreement (including these Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy arising out of or related to the Award, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Award Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Award, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 14). 4
15. GOVERNING LAW This Award Agreement, including these Terms, shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder) and applicable federal law. 16. SEVERABILITY If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 14 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Award Agreement (including these Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Award Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Award Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Award Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder. 17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Award Agreement (including these Terms), the Plan and the Employment Agreement together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof. 18. SECTION HEADINGS The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof. 5

[WESTERN DIGITAL LOGO] Western Digital Corporation 20511 Lake Forest Drive Lake Forest, California 92630 Telephone 949 672-7000 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan 1. OPTION SUBJECT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN. The option (the "Option") referred to in the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Option Agreement (the "Notice") was issued under Western Digital Corporation's (the "Corporation's") Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Option is subject to the terms and provisions of the Notice, these Terms and Conditions for Stock Options (these "Terms"), and the Plan. To the extent any information in the Notice, the prospectus for the Plan, or other information provided by the Corporation conflicts with the Plan and/or these Terms, the Plan or these Terms, as applicable, shall control. To the extent any terms and provisions in these Terms conflict with the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control. The holder of the Option is referred to herein as the "Participant." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of these Terms, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan after the grant date of the Option. 2. OPTION AGREEMENT. The Notice and these Terms, together, constitute the Option Agreement with respect to the Option pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Plan. 3. TYPE OF STOCK OPTION The Notice indicates whether the Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option (an "ISO") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or is a nonqualified stock option (an option that is not an ISO). ISOs are subject to additional requirements under the Code as generally described in Section 5.1 of the Plan. If the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs (whether granted under the Option or otherwise) first become exercisable by the Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, as measured on the applicable option grant dates and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the limitations of Section 5.1.2 of the Plan shall apply and to such extent the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. 4. VESTING The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth in the Notice. The first vesting installment of the Option shall be a fixed installment covering the number of shares, and vesting on the fixed vesting date, set forth in the first line of the Notice under "Vesting." In each case, the Option is subject to earlier termination in accordance with Section 5. 1
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, to the extent that the Option is outstanding and otherwise unvested immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Option shall vest and become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Change in Control Event. This acceleration provision shall not in any way limit the Corporation's ability to terminate the Option in connection with a Change in Control Event as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan; provided that, in any such circumstances, the Optionee is given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise the outstanding portion of the Option in accordance with its terms (subject to Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of the Plan, after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting) before the termination of the Option in such circumstances (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of accelerated vesting and the impending termination be required and any acceleration may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event). The Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested and exercisable. To the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable, the Participant has the right to exercise the Option (to the extent not previously exercised), and such right shall continue, until the expiration or earlier termination of the Option as provided in Section 5. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 6 below or under the Plan. 5. EXPIRATION OF OPTION The Option shall expire and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect thereto upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 6 below, (b) the termination of the Option as provided in Section 7.4 of the Plan, or (c) the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. The Option may not be exercised at any time after a termination or expiration of the Option. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, TOTAL DISABILITY OR DEATH The Option shall be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her permitted successor in interest) following the Participant's termination of employment only to the extent provided below in this Section 6. Except as provided in Section 6(f) below, the last day that the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to a period of non-employment by any such entity is referred to as the Participant's "Severance Date." In each case described below, the Option shall be subject to earlier termination as contemplated by Section 5. (a) Termination of Employment Generally. In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason (other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause (as such term is defined in that certain Employment Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2006, by and between the Participant and the Corporation (the "Employment Agreement")), due to the Participant's death or Retirement (as defined below), or at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled (as defined below)), the Option, to the extent then otherwise scheduled to vest (assuming the Participant's employment by the Corporation did not terminate) in the six-month period following the Participant's termination, shall become vested on the Participant's Severance Date. In addition, in the event of such a termination, the Option shall terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date (after giving effect to the preceding sentence) and, to the extent that the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three months following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-month period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-month period. (b) Total Disability. In the event that the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when the Participant is Totally Disabled and is not eligible to Retire, the Option shall 2
terminate on the Participant's Severance Date to the extent that it is not vested and exercisable on that date. In such circumstances, or in the event that the Participant incurs such a Total Disability within not more than three months of the Participant's Severance Date if the termination of the Participant's employment was for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option may, to the extent the Option was exercisable by the Participant on the Participant's Severance Date, be exercised by the Participant (or, if the Participant is then incapacitated, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs, or legatees) at any time during the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the one-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the one-year period. For purposes of the Option, "Total Disability" (which term shall include "Totally Disabled") means a "permanent and total disability" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code. (c) Death. If the Participant dies while he or she is an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable, at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. (d) Retirement. If the Participant Retires from the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Option (to the extent outstanding and not previously vested and exercisable) shall vest and become exercisable on the Participant's Severance Date and shall continue to be exercisable by the Participant (or if the Participant is then deceased, by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, as applicable) at any time during the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Retired Participant provides services to a competitor of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, consultant, director, officer, representative, independent contractor or otherwise, or otherwise competes with the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries (in each case as determined by the Administrator its sole discretion), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall immediately terminate. In addition, in such event the Corporation shall have the right to recover any profits realized by such Retired Participant as a result of any exercise of the Option during the six-month period prior to the date such Retired Participant commenced providing such services to a competitor. For this purpose, the Participant shall be deemed to have "Retired" (which term shall include "Retirement," "Retire" and "Retires") if the Participant retires from employment with the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than Cause after satisfying all of the following at the time of such retirement: (i) the Participant is at least 65 years of age, (ii) the Participant's age plus total years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) totals at least 75, and (iii) the Participant has five (5) or more years of continuous service with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) ending on the date of such retirement. For purposes of calculating "age plus total years of continuous service" under clause (ii) above, fractional years shall be disregarded but may be cumulated (so that, by way of example only, a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 6 months of continuous service would satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), while a Participant who is age 65 and 6 months with 9 years and 5 months of continuous service would not satisfy the requirements of clause (ii)). For purposes of calculating the Participant's "years of continuous service" under clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, in no event shall the Participant accrue more than one year of service with respect to any period of twelve consecutive months (that is, concurrent employment by both the Corporation and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by multiple Subsidiaries, for a month shall not be counted as more than one month of service). (e) Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, if the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for Cause, the Option (whether or not all or any portion of such Option is then vested and exercisable) shall immediately terminate on the Participant's Severance Date. (f) Special Incentive Vesting and Exercisability. In the event the Participant remains employed by the Corporation as its President and Chief Executive Officer through January 1, 2012, thereafter upon the termination of 3
the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (for any reason other than a termination by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause), the Option (and any other stock options granted to the Participant during the Employment Period (as defined in the Employment Agreement)) shall become fully vested as of the Participant's Severance Date, and it may be exercised by the Participant at any time within three years following the Participant's Severance Date. The Option, to the extent exercisable for the three-year period following the Participant's Severance Date and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the three-year period. (g) Continuation of Services. If the Participant's employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries terminates (regardless of the reason) but, immediately thereafter, the Participant continues to render services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as an employee, director or consultant, such Participant's Severance Date for purposes of the Option shall not be the date such Participant's employment terminates, but instead shall be the last day that the Participant either is employed by or actually renders services to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. As provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of the Option of whether the Participant continues to render services the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated. (h) Exercise Period for ISOs. Notwithstanding any post-termination exercise period provided for herein or in the Plan, the Option will qualify as an ISO only if it is exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs under, and meets all of the other requirements of, the Code. If the Option is not exercised within the applicable exercise periods for ISOs or does not meet such other requirements, the Option will be rendered a nonqualified stock option. (i) No Duplication of Benefits. The provisions of this Section 7 are not intended to supersede any rights or benefits to which the Participant may become entitled under the Corporation's Executive Severance Plan or Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan (collectively, the "Severance Plans"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Participant become entitled to any duplication of benefits under the Option Agreement and under the Severance Plans. 7. EXERCISE OF OPTION The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of: - a written notice stating the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the Option or by the completion of such other administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may require from time to time, - payment in full for the purchase price (the per-share exercise price of the Option multiplied by the number of shares to be purchased) in cash, check or by electronic funds transfer to the Corporation, or (subject to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing requirements and further subject to such rules as the Administrator may adopt as to any non-cash payment) in shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant, valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, provided, however, that any shares initially acquired upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise from the Corporation must have been owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months before the date of such exercise; - any written statements or agreements required by the Administrator pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan; and - satisfaction of the tax withholding provisions of Section 8.5 of the Plan. 4
The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator. The Option will qualify as an ISO only if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Code. 8. NONTRANSFERABILITY The Option and any other rights of the Participant under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Participant, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. For purposes of clarity, the Administrator has not authorized any transfer exceptions as contemplated by Section 5.7.2 of the Plan. 9. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Participant's status, if he or she is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation. 10. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Neither the Participant nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option except as to such shares, if any, as shall have been actually issued to such person and recorded in such person's name following the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof. 11. NOTICES Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11. 12. ARBITRATION Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Option Agreement (including these Terms) and/or the Plan, their enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of their provisions, or any other controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Option or the Participant's employment, including, but not limited to, any state or federal statutory claims, shall be submitted to arbitration in Orange County, California, before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., Orange, California, or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by either party to this Option Agreement in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief 5
granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable state or federal statutes. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with any of the matters referenced in the first sentence above. The parties agree that Corporation shall be responsible for payment of the forum costs of any arbitration hereunder, including the arbitrator's fee. The parties further agree that in any proceeding with respect to such matters, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs (other than forum costs associated with the arbitration) incurred by it or him or her in connection with the resolution of the dispute. By accepting the Option, the Participant consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 12). 13.

SEVERABILITY If the arbitrator selected in accordance with Section 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Option Agreement (including these Terms) or the Plan is in violation of any statute or public policy, then only the portions of this Option Agreement or the Plan, as applicable, which are found to violate such statute or public policy shall be stricken, and all portions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which are not found to violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Furthermore, it is the parties' intent that any order striking any portion of this Option Agreement and/or the Plan should modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties hereunder. 15.

The Plan and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof. 16. SECTION HEADINGS The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof. 6

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Nov. 2, 2006  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $1.3 billion on shipments of approximately 22.7 million units, and net income of $103 million, or $.46 per share for its first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 29, 2006. Included in the unit shipments were approximately 2.2 million 2.5-inch mobile hard drives and approximately 2.5 million 3.5-inch hard drives for utilization in personal and digital video recorders both fast-growing, newer markets for the company.
     In a separate news release today, the company announced that president and chief operating officer John Coyne will become chief executive officer on January 2, 2007 and that current chief executive officer Arif Shakeel will remain with the company through June 29, 2007 as a full-time advisor and will stand for re-election to the board of directors at the next annual meeting. Coyne has joined the board and will also stand for re-election.
     The first quarter results represented strong year-over-year performance, including 33 percent unit growth, 25 percent growth in revenue versus $1.0 billion in the year-ago period and 49 percent
 
WD Announces Q1 Revenue of $1.3 Billion and Net Income of $.46 Per Share Page 2
growth in net income over the $69 million reported last year. A year ago, the company reported earnings of $.31 per share in the fiscal first quarter and shipped 17.1 million units.
     WD indicated that 35 percent of its Q1 revenue was derived from non-desktop PC sources including notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications, and retail sales. Sixty-five percent of the company's first quarter revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs, a market that remains strong. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 25 percent non-desktop PC revenue, 75 percent desktop PC revenue.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company generated $128 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, ending with total cash and short-term investments of $751 million.
     Arif Shakeel, chief executive officer of WD, said, "Several years ago we identified expansion into new markets as a major long-term goal of the company. We have achieved this off the base of a highly-successful desktop hard drive business and an efficient and leveraged business model. Our Q1 results reflect the ongoing success of this diversification effort and a continuation of our consistent financial performance. As we address multiple growth opportunities in the years ahead, we will continue our emphasis on excellence in operations, including a relentless focus on customer satisfaction and the reliability and quality of our products."
     The company's operating results reflected in this release do not include any adjustment relating to the findings of the Special Committee, previously announced on Oct. 23, 2006, with respect to its review of the company's historical stock option grants. Based on the review, it has been preliminarily determined that the company should have recognized approximately $21 million of additional stock-based compensation and tax-related expenses in its historical financial statements. However, the company does not anticipate a material adjustment to the operating results included in this release nor to the results for fiscal 2005 and 2006 included in its July 27, 2006 press release.

(e) At its meeting on November 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for each of the two $1,000,000 performance cash awards (valued at target) awarded to John F. Coyne on October 31, 2006, as previously described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 2, 2006. As previously disclosed in such Form 8-K, the first cash award corresponds to the performance period July 1, 2006 through June 29, 2007 and the second cash award corresponds to the performance period July 1, 2006 through June 27, 2008. For each cash award, the Compensation Committee determined that payment of the award would be conditioned upon the Company's accomplishment of specified performance goals as measured by predetermined financial operating metrics, in various combinations, for the performance period applicable to the award. Depending upon the Company's achievement of these predetermined performance g oals, the first cash award will be paid within a reasonable period of time following the end of the Company's 2007 fiscal year and the second cash award will be paid within a reasonable period of time following the end of the Company's 2008 fiscal year, in each case based on a percentage of the target amount (ranging from 0% to 200%). Each performance cash award is further subject to the terms and conditions of a Notice of Grant of Long-Term Cash Award and Long-Term Cash Award Agreement -- Executives in substantially the form previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also established the performance goals for the cash bonus awards under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the second half of fiscal year 2007. The Compensation Committee determined that funding of the ICP for this period will be based upon the accomplishment of predetermined performance goals as measured by a predetermined financial operating metric. Under the ICP, the Company's executive officers and certain other employees may be awarded cash bonus awards based on the Company's achievement of these predetermined performance goals. For executive officers, a target amount has been established as a percentage of base salary ranging from 75% to 100% of base salary. Depending upon the Company's achievement of these performance goals, the ICP may fund based on a percentage of the target bonus amount (ranging from 0% to 200% of the target). However, individual participation in the ICP is based on individual performance, and actual awards may vary upward or downward. Also, on November 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an increase in the annual base salary of Stephen D. Milligan from $400,000 to $450,000. This increase became effective on November 9, 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jan. 25, 2007  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $1.4 billion on shipments of approximately 24.5 million units, and net income of $128 million, or $.57 per share, for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 29, 2006. These results represented strong year-over-year performance, including 28 percent growth in revenue, 35 percent unit growth and 23 percent growth in net income. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.1 billion, unit shipments of 18.1 million and net income of $104 million, or $.47 per share.
     Forty-two percent of Q2 revenue was derived from newer market sources, while 58 percent came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 26 percent newer markets versus 74 percent desktop PC revenue. The company's newer market revenue includes hard drives for notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications, and WD branded products/retail sales.

     The company shipped 2.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 2.7 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market, compared with 1.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively, a year ago. The branded products/retail performance was another strong factor in the diversification of the business, accounting for approximately $238 million, or 17 percent of quarterly revenue. The success of WD branded products is being driven by strong global acceptance of the 3.5-inch My Book and 2.5-inch WD Passport Portable external storage appliances, both noted for their simple and intuitive design. In the year-ago quarter, the company's branded products/retail business totaled approximately $56 million, or 5 percent of revenue.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company generated $184 million in cash from operations during the December quarter, ending with total cash and short-term investments of $830 million.
     "The second quarter results are linked directly to the significant investments in technology and global infrastructure that WD has made over the last several years, both in traditional computing markets and in the newer consumer electronics markets for hard drives," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer. "We continue to reinvest the strong cash flows from our ongoing business into current and future opportunities for data storage. Combined with our focus on customers, quality, reliability and execution, we believe this approach will enable us to continue delivering steady and outstanding financial performance."
     The investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook will be broadcast live over the Internet today at 2 p.m. PST/5 p.m. EST. The call will be accessible live and on an archived basis via the link below:

At investment community events on February 28, 2007 and March 1, 2007, executives of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") will provide investors with an update regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  As expected, overall demand in the hard drive market in the March quarter is reflecting typical seasonality compared with the stronger December quarter.  Demand in the faster growth hard drive markets and the Company's positioning in those markets are helping to partially offset the March quarter seasonal patterns. Those markets include branded products, consumer electronics, notebook and segments of the enterprise market.  Price declines are within expectations for the quarter.  Weeks of inventory in the distribution channel for the industry and for the Company are within the long-stated manageable range of 4 to 6 weeks.  The month of March wi ll, as is typical, be a key factor in determining the quarter for the industry and for the Company.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning conditions in the hard drive industry, the Company's expectations regarding pricing, inventory levels, and demand for hard drives and the effects of seasonality in the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; changes in the availability and cost of specialized product components, including media; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard drive markets; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes and new technologies; business conditions and growth in the notebook, consumer electronics, enterprise, branded products and desktop markets; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 7, 2007, to which your attention is directed.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At meetings with investors and analysts this week, executives of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") will provide updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry, its plans for future wafer fabrication capacity additions, and shipments of its newest PMR-based 2.5 inch products. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:  As expected, demand and pricing in the hard drive markets thus far in the June quarter are seasonally soft.  Historically, June quarter shipment patterns are more back-end loaded than other quarters. As a result, business in the remainder of the quarter will determine the Companys June quarter financial performance.  Weeks of inventory in the distribution channel for the industry and for the Company are within the long-stated manageable range of 4 to 6 weeks.  The Company has finalized plans for expanding its head wafer fabrication capacity. Specifically, the Company currently expects to spend approximately $200 million in its fiscal year 2008 and approximately $100 million in each of the subsequent two fiscal years, for a total of approximately $400 million for this purpose over the three-year period. The expansion involves additions to the Companys existing head manufacturing facilities. These investments are incremental to the Companys normal capital expenditures levels. Previously, the Company had indicated that the wafer fabrication expansion could require a new facility and the expenditure could total as much as $800 million.  In a separate press release today, the Company announced it is now shipping the new 250 GB WD Scorpio 2.5-inch Serial ATA hard drive for notebook PCs, one of the industrys fastest growing markets. The drives utilize the Companys own perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology to achieve the industrys highest capacity in a small form factor drive and have WD proprietary features that make the drive quiet, use less power and run at cool operating temperatures. The WD Scorpio 250 GB hard drive is a result of the significant investments the Company has made in proprietary head technologies as well as significant system level feature innovation.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning demand, pricing and inventory conditions in the hard drive industry and for the Company for the June quarter, the Company's expectations that business in the remainder of the quarter will determine the Company's June quarter financial performance, and the Company's capital expenditure plans over the next three fiscal years for expansion of its head wafer fabrication capacity. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices (ASPs); actions by competitors; changes in the availability and cost of specialized product components; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; changes in product and customer mix; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard drive markets; difficulties in reducing yield losses from complex manufacturing processes and new technologies; business conditions and growth in the notebook, consumer electronics, enterprise, branded products and desktop markets; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 8, 2007, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On June 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning June 30, 2007 and ending December 28, 2007. Under the ICP, the Company's executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Company's achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning June 30, 2007 and ending December 28, 2007, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% an d 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 100% for the executive officers. At the end of the 6-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Company's performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Company's overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus percentage multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment as described in the next sentence. The actual bonus awarded to an executive off icer under the ICP may be adjusted upward or downward in the discretion of the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive's individual and business group's performance.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
     On June 28, 2007, Western Digital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Komag, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Komag") and State M Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Offeror"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Offeror will commence a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of Komag's outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), at a price per share of $32.25, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the "Offer Price"). Komag is currently a material supplier of media to the Company.
     The Offer will be conditioned upon, among other things, (1) the valid tender of the number of Shares that would represent a majority of the sum of (a) all Shares outstanding as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer plus (b) all Shares underlying any rights to acquire Shares (including Komag stock options but excluding the outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 of Komag) outstanding as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer with an exercise price less than the Offer Price and which are vested as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer or would vest within two months after the scheduled expiration of the Offer and (2) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
     Following the consummation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement provides for the Offeror to merge with and into Komag, pursuant to which Komag will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). In the Merger, all remaining Shares, other than such Shares held by stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, or such higher amount as may be paid for Shares in the Offer. The transaction is expected to be completed in third calendar quarter of 2007. The boards of directors of each of the Company, Komag and the Offeror have unanimously approved the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
     The parties have agreed that if, following the consummation of the Offer, the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Company, owns at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, the Merger will be completed without a meeting of Komag's stockholders, in accordance with Delaware's short-form merger statute. The Merger Agreement grants the Offeror an irrevocable option, exercisable after consummation of the Offer subject to certain conditions and limitations, to purchase a number of Shares from Komag at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that, when added to the shares directly or indirectly owned by the Company, would equal one share more than 90% of the outstanding Shares.
     The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, the Offeror and Komag, including among others, covenants by Komag concerning the conduct of its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. The closing of the Merger is subject to closing conditions, including approval of the Merger by the remaining stockholders of Komag, if required.
Table of Contents
     Also on June 28, 2007, the Company obtained a debt financing commitment for a senior secured term loan of up to $1.25 billion for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including payment of the consideration payable to Komag's stockholders in the Offer and the Merger (including to holders of the Komag's stock options and other equity incentives). Consummation of the Offer and the Merger are not subject to a financing condition.
     The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference. The Merger Agreement, which has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or Komag, contains representations and warranties of each of the Company, Komag and the Offeror. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement, including information contained in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties exchanged in connection with signing the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, investors and security holders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of a specific date and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules. In addition, certain representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the respective parties rather than establishing matters of fact. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's or Komag's public disclosures.
Tender and Voting Agreement
     In order to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the directors and executive officers of Komag entered into a tender and voting agreement with Company and the Offeror (the "Tender and Voting Agreement") concurrent with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Tender and Voting Agreement, such stockholders agreed, among other things, to tender their Shares in the Offer no later than the fifth business day prior to the initial expiration date of the Offer and, if required, to vote their Shares in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing descriptions of the Tender and Voting Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Tender and Voting Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference.
Forward-Looking Statements
     This document contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, costs related to the proposed tender offer and merger, the risk of failing to meet the minimum tender condition or obtain any required stockholder or regulatory approvals or satisfy other conditions to the transaction, the risk that the transaction will not close or that closing will be delayed, the risk that our business will suffer due to uncertainty related to the transaction and other risks related to our business set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007.

Additional Information and Where to Find it
     The solicitation and the offer to buy shares of Komag's common stock will only be made pursuant to an offer to purchase and related materials that the Company intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Once filed, Komag shareholders should read these materials carefully prior to making any decisions with respect to the offer because they contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Once filed, Komag shareholders will be able to obtain the offer to purchase and related materials with respect to the offer free at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, from the Information Agent named in the tender offer materials or from the Company.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     Concurrent with obtaining the debt financing commitment described above, the Company terminated its existing $125.0 million senior credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. and other credit parties identified therein. The credit facility consisted of a revolving credit line (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation) and a term loan.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of June 28, 2007 (this "Agreement"), by and among Western Digital Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), State M Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and Komag, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). WHEREAS Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $32.25 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; WHEREAS the Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub have each unanimously approved the Offer and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into an agreement with Parent in substantially the form attached as Exhibit B hereto pursuant to which such stockholders shall agree, among other things, to tender their shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer (the "Voting and Tender Agreement"). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I The Offer SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the proviso in the first sentence of Section 1.02(b), as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 10 business days) after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent
2 shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer; provided that, if the Company is unable to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same day Parent is prepared to commence the Offer, then such 10-business day period shall be tolled until such time as the Company is prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day immediately following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Subject to applicable Law, Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any time prior to the expiration of the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive the Minimum Tender Condition or the conditions to the Offer set forth in lettered paragraph (b) of Exhibit A or numbered paragraph (i) of Exhibit A, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify any Offer Condition (other than as required by Law, the SEC or its Staff in a manner that is not adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock), (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), extend the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or any manner that would result in any mandatory extension of the Offer (other than an increase in the Offer Price in response to an Acquisition Proposal). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (A) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Tender Condition or any of the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A) is not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)), Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to 10 business days each (or (x) any longer period as may be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company or (y) any shorter period ending on the Termination Date, if applicable) in order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer; and (B) Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to) extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to and in accordance with this
3 Section 1.01(a)). Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing", and the time at which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Time". Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents shall provide for such a reservation of right. (b) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Offer Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall furnish to Parent and Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws, the SEC or its staff or the NYSE. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof). (d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.
4 (e) Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub. SECTION 1.02. Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) The Company file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC on the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company with the Offer Documents. Parent and Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws, the SEC or its staff or the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change (and except for any Schedule 14D-9 filing in which the Company discloses an Adverse Recommendation Change), prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof). (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the
5 names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or control. (d) At any time after the Offer Closing Time, Parent may request the Company to take all necessary actions, and the Company agrees to take such actions, to deregister the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act and/or to delist the Shares from the Nasdaq Global Select Market if (A) such actions are otherwise permitted under applicable Law, and (B) such actions are reasonably expected to permit the Closing to occur sooner than it would otherwise occur. (e) Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) in the Offer Documents. If the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, neither Sub nor Parent may include the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) in the Offer Documents without the Company's prior written consent. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall include the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) in the Schedule 14D-9. SECTION 1.03. Top-Up Option. (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares; provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or other legal impediment shall make the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up
6 Option Shares pursuant thereto illegal, the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Sub may only exercise the Top-Up Option on a single occasion after the expiration of the Offer and in any case only if, as a result of and immediately following the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, Parent will directly or indirectly hold one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares). (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the Company one business day prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in an amount of cash equal to the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares, by wire transfer or cashier's check, and (ii) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a promissory note in the form of Exhibit C with a principal amount equal to the remaining exercise price of the Top-Up Shares. Parent and Sub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock which Sub will acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an Accredited Investor within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are not being acquired with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. ARTICLE II The Merger SECTION 2.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").
7 SECTION 2.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 5:30 a.m., California time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, 610 Newport Center Drive, 17th Floor, Newport Beach, California 92660, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied or waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". SECTION 2.03. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time". SECTION 2.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. SECTION 2.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) Subject to the terms of Section 6.05(a), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit D hereto and, as so amended, the Company Certificate shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. (b) Subject to the terms of Section 6.05(a), the Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. SECTION 2.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. SECTION 2.07. Officers. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.
8 SECTION 2.08. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, following the Offer Closing Time, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including as a result of the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance of the Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto), the parties hereto shall, subject to Article VII hereof, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the satisfaction of such threshold, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. ARTICLE III Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates SECTION 3.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub: (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent- and Sub-Owned Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. (c) Company Subsidiary-Owned Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned, directly or indirectly, by any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Company Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and (ii) except as provided in Section 3.01(e), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
9 (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02(f) and any applicable tax Law. (e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(d), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(d). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. SECTION 3.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, promptly after the Effective Time (and from time to time thereafter, if necessary), Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(d) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.
10 (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective
11 Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

At any time following the date six months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 3.01(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries operations. SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation. (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer, employee,
48 investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative (collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly (and it shall instruct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to instruct, each Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to), (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative thereof) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any person (or any representative thereof) with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith either constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), the Company may, and may authorize and permit any of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its advisors and representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are no less restrictive (in all but de minimis respects) to such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 13, 2007 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement") and that allows for the Company to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02 (including the notification provisions of Section 5.02(b) and (c)), provided that all such information has been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its advisors and representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute, represent or generate 15% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, hold the assets or businesses referred to in clause (i) above.
49 For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer, which did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) for a transaction that, if consummated, would result in such person (or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all of the terms and conditions and other characteristics of such proposal, including (A) the probability of, and time necessary to achieve, consummation of such proposal, and (B) all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer or this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise)) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as such) than the Offer and the Merger, taken together. (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a third party if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
50 8.01(e), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 8.01(e) shall be void and of no force and effect, unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects with all the provisions of this Section 5.02 in connection with such Superior Proposal (including the notification provisions of this Section 5.02(b)) and with all applicable requirements of Section 6.06(b) (including payment of the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal, and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) unless (I) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent (an "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a third party, which notice shall attach the definitive form of written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and (II) Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the five business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a third party, the Company and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers, directors, and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 5.02(a) and 5.02(b), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within one business day after the receipt thereof, notify Parent of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall (as promptly as practicable and in any event within one business day notify Parent of any material change or other material development with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company (or such lesser notice as is provided to such Board of Directors generally) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.
51 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or otherwise making any statements or disclosing any information to its stockholders that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) to make or disclose in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b); provided further that any "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed in compliance with the terms of Section 5.02(b) and shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change in the event that it includes an express reaffirmation of the Board of Directors of the Company's recommendation set forth in Section 4.02. ARTICLE VI Additional Agreements SECTION 6.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting. (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers
52 such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval.

Subject to Section 5.02(b)(i), the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent, Sub and their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates shall hold, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote on adoption of this Agreement under the DGCL and other applicable Law following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable without the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. (c) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the Stockholder Approval and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are required by the DGCL and any other applicable Law to effect the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other representatives and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request
53 (including the work papers of KPMG LLP). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to provide the foregoing access to Parent or to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other representatives or advisors, or to disclose any information Parent or to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other representatives and advisors, in any case pursuant to this Section 6.02 or otherwise, if (i) such access or disclosure would cause a loss, waiver or impairment of the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not result in such loss, waiver or impairment, which reasonable best efforts shall include entering into one or more joint defense or community of interest agreements on customary terms if counsels to the parties reasonably conclude that such agreements are likely to preserve the privilege), or (ii) if the Company determines, after consultation with Parent and considering the advice of the Company's outside counsel, that such access or disclosure would violate any Law or Judgment applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or breach or otherwise violate any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to get consents from the counter-parties to any such Contracts in order to allow the Company to disclose confidential information to Parent and its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other representatives or advisors. SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A and Article VII, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving

In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree with a Governmental Entity without the prior written consent of Parent, to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any material assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any material portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any such action, an "Action of Divestiture"). (b) (i) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing: (A) that any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in numbered paragraph (ii) of Exhibit A to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer;
55 (B) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers become aware that any person (other than a Governmental Entity) has alleged that the consent of such person is required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers become aware that any customer, distributor or reseller is terminating its relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (D) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers become aware of any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the Company's written notice; and (E) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers become aware of any investigations by any Governmental Entity or any actions, suits or proceedings or material claims, in each case (I) commenced against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (II) relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.01(h) or that relate to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. (ii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that this Section 6.03(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense.
56 (d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Offer Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to identify and segregate any confidential information of third parties in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating the return to such third parties or destruction of such confidential information as promptly as practicable after the Offer Closing; provided that the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this undertaking that would cause a disruption in, or inability of, the Company to manufacture its products. SECTION 6.04. Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each In-The-Money Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted into the right to receive, with the same vesting schedule as was applicable to the Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to such In-the-Money Company Stock Option, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.04, the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Company Stock Option (with respect to each such vested or unvested Company Stock Option, the "Option Per Share Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Date, all Company Stock Options which are not "In-the-Money Company Stock Options" as of the Effective Date shall be cancelled. (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company Optionholders of In-the-Money Company Stock Options appropriate notices (the "Company Stock Option Notices") informing them that each In-the-Money Company Stock Option has been converted into the right to receive the Option Per Share Merger Consideration. Promptly after the vesting of an In-the-Money Company Stock Option, Parent shall pay to such Company Optionholder of a vested In-the-Money Company Stock Option the Option Per Share Merger Consideration. Payment shall be made no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the end of the month in which the Company Optionholder's In-the-Money Company Stock Option becomes vested. (c) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Purchase Right outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, with the same vesting schedule and agreement as was applicable to the Company Stock Purchase Right, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.04, the Merger Consideration. (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Purchase Right appropriate notices (the "Company Stock Purchase Right Notices") (i) informing them that each Company Stock Purchase Right has been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) setting forth the schedule as to when such Company Stock Purchase Right vests. Promptly following the vesting of each Company Stock Purchase
57 Right, Parent shall pay to such holder of the Company Stock Purchase Right the Merger Consideration. If all conditions for payment have been satisfied, then payment shall be made no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the end of the month in which the Company Stock Purchase Right becomes vested. (e) Except as (i) otherwise agreed to in writing or (ii) as otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.04 and except to the extent required under the respective terms of the Company Stock Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company Stock Options, the Company Stock Purchase Rights, and related agreements, all restrictions, cancellations, terminations or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Company Stock Options or Company Stock Purchase Rights awarded under the Company Stock Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or the Subsidiaries, to the extent that such restrictions, cancellations, terminations or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Rights after giving effect to the Merger and the conversion as set forth above. (f) For purposes of this Agreement, "In-The-Money Company Stock Options" means all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price lower than the Merger Consideration; and (ii) "Company Optionholders" means the holders of In-The-Money Company Stock Options. (g) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest. (h) The Company shall ensure that each provision in each Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company Common Stock or any Company Stock Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights or any other interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted prior to the Effective Time, and shall ensure, prior to the Effective Time that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights or any other interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. (i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in all events prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the terms of this Section 6.04.
58 SECTION 6.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) Parent and Sub shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and fulfill in all respects all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed on Section 6.05 of the Company Letter shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; provided that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law. (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall Parent be required to pay, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective Time, premiums for insurance under this Section 6.05(c) that in the aggregate exceed 225% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which premium is hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be set forth in Section 6.05(b) of the Company Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 225% amount; provided further that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.05(c) by causing the
59 Surviving Corporation to obtain, at the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, in each case, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 6.05(c). Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy to its existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (which "tail" policy shall contain the same terms and conditions as such existing policy), and in such event, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 6.05(c) for such six-year period; provided that in no event shall the Company pay a premium for such "tail" policy that in the aggregate exceeds 225% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (it being understood that the Company may nevertheless acquire a "tail" policy providing such coverage as may be obtained for such 225% amount). (d) The obligations set forth in this Section 6.05 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any indemnified party under this Section 6.05 (or his or her heirs and his or her representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected indemnified party (or his or her heirs and his or her representatives). The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. SECTION 6.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. (b) In the event that (i) a 50% Proposal is publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known to the Company's stockholders or an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a 50% Proposal is publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known to the Company's stockholders and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any 40% Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company recommends acceptance of any 40% Proposal or any 40% Proposal is consummated, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a cash fee equal to $38,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a
60 termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d), within two business days after such termination, (B) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section 6.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of such events and (C) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e), prior to or concurrently with such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "50% Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal," except that all references therein to "15% or more" shall be deemed references to "50% or more." For purposes of this Agreement, the term "40% Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal," except that all references therein to "15% or more" shall be deemed references to "40% or more." (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.06 do not constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 6.06 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 6.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.06 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. SECTION 6.07. Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, further agree that they shall consult with the other with respect to any other press releases, public statements and other public communications relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which case, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other to the extent reasonably practicable before making any such press release or other public statements or other public communications with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided however that the parties shall not be required to consult with the other with respect to any press release or other public statements or other public communications after the Board of Directors of the Company effects an Adverse Recommendation Change (or pursuant to which the Board of Directors of the Company discloses or announces an Adverse Recommendation Change).
61 SECTION 6.08. Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Sub to fulfill all of Sub's obligations under this Agreement, and in the event that Sub shall fail to fulfill any of its obligations hereunder, Parent shall fulfill such obligations. SECTION 6.09. Directors. Following the Offer Closing, Parent or Sub shall be entitled to designate, from time to time, such number of members of the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (a) the total number of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer) bears to (ii) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that, in the event that Parent's designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company, until the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date hereof who are Independent Directors; provided further, that if there is in office only one Independent Director, the Board of Directors of the Company will take all reasonable action necessary to cause a person designated by the remaining Independent Director to fill such vacancy who shall be an Independent Director or, if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate two persons to fill the vacancies who shall be Independent Directors. The Company shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election or appointment, including (A) increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company and (B) obtaining the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointment to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Rule 4350(d)(2) of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.). The Company shall take all action necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board of Directors of the Company and committees of such Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
62 SECTION 6.10. Convertible Notes. From and after the Offer Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to take all actions reasonably necessary to comply with the terms of the Indenture with respect to the Company Convertible Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of March 28, 2007, by and among the Company and certain initial purchasers of the Company Convertible Notes. SECTION 6.11. Parent and Sub Financing. (a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub in such definitive agreements that are within their control, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (v) consummate the Financing at or prior to Offer Closing; provided that notwithstanding, and as an alternative to, the foregoing, Parent and Sub may in any case obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Sub then the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter ("New Debt Financing Commitments") ; provided further that any such New Debt Financing Commitments shall not (A) expand or adversely change in any material respect the conditions to the Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent and Sub to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. Upon and from and after such event, the term "Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent in effect at the time in question and the New Debt Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources ("Alternative Financing") on terms that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Sub then the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised as to the status of, and any material developments relating to, the Financing. (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and Sub with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing, including, without limitation, (A) using reasonable best efforts to assist in the preparation of confidential information memoranda and rating agency presentations with respect to the Financing or any Alternative Financing, (B) delivering such financial and statistical information and projections relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in

SECTION 6.12. Employee Benefits. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall arrange for each Company Benefit Plan participant who becomes a Parent employee (or an employee of any Parent subsidiary or affiliate) after the Effective Time (the "Transferred Employees") to be eligible for at least substantially the same benefits in the aggregate as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Each Transferred Employee (including without limitation all eligible dependents) shall, to the extent permitted by law and applicable tax qualification requirements, receive credit including for eligibility to participate and vesting under Parent employee benefit plans for years of service with the Company (and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and predecessors) prior to the Effective Time (except where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits). If applicable, Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents in accordance with applicable laws and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent employee benefit plans or programs in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 6.12) shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide any person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Company Benefit Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (iii) limit in any way the Surviving Corporation's ability to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at any time.
64 SECTION 6.13. Company 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary steps to terminate the Company's Incorporated Savings and Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and cease all future contributions to the 401(k) Plan, effective as of a date prior to the Closing Date (other than the repayment by 401(k) Plan participants of any outstanding loan). SECTION 6.14. FIRPTA Certificate.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
67 in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. SECTION 8.05. Approval of Independent Directors. Following the election or appointment of Parent's or Sub's designees pursuant to Section 6.09 and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office shall be required for the Company to consent (a) to amend or terminate this Agreement, (b) to waive any of the Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement, (c) to extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub, or (d) to take any other action of the Company's Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Sub).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jul. 26, 2007  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported its financial results for its fiscal year 2007 and fourth quarter ended June 29, 2007.
     The company's results for the fiscal year reflected strong year-over-year performance, with revenue of $5.5 billion and operating income of $415 million. Net income was $585 million, or $2.59 per share, compared to $395 million, or $1.76 per share for the prior year. The 2007 and 2006 net income amounts included income tax benefits of $147 million and $22 million, respectively, related to adjustments to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     These results represented increases in revenue of 26 percent over the prior year's $4.3 billion, unit shipment growth of 32 percent from 73.3 million to 96.5 million, and growth in cash and short term investments from $699 million to $907 million. On a year-over-year basis, the company expanded its share of revenue from newer markets from 29 percent

to 43 percent. The company's newer market revenue includes hard drives for notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications and WD branded products.
     For the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $1.4 billion on shipments of approximately 24.9 million units, with net income of $233 million, or $1.03 per share. The fourth quarter net income includes a $147 million benefit to income taxes reflecting a favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
     The June quarter results also represented strong year-over-year performance, including growth in revenue and unit shipments of 26 percent and 30 percent, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.1 billion, unit shipments of 19.2 million, and net income of $120 million, or $.53 per share. Net income in the year-ago period included $13 million in favorable adjustments to gross margin related to the resolution of certain items that impacted amounts previously recorded as cost, and a $22 million benefit to income taxes related to an adjustment to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     Forty-six percent of Q4 revenue was derived from newer market sources, while 54 percent came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 34 percent newer markets versus 66 percent desktop PC revenue.
     The company shipped 3.8 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 2.7 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market, compared with 1.6 million and 2.2 million, respectively, a year ago. Branded products revenue of $230 million increased 142 percent from the prior year's $95 million. The company also continued to steadily grow its shipments of enterprise-class Serial ATA drives, the fastest-growing segment of the enterprise drive market.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 26, 2007, Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, including an income tax benefit of $147 million related to an adjustment to the valuation allowance of Western Digital's deferred tax assets.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On August 30, 2007, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. ("WDTI"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Bridge Facility") with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as administrative agent, Citicorp Global Capital Markets and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as arrangers. The Bridge Facility provides for a $1.25 billion unsecured bridge loan. The proceeds of the Bridge Facility are expected to be used for the following purposes:
     As of the date hereof, WDTI has no borrowings outstanding under the Bridge Facility. A portion of the Bridge Facility is expected to be funded on the date of the Tender Offer closing, and WDTI will have the right to make up to two additional drawings under the Bridge Facility prior to the sixth-month anniversary of the Tender Offer closing, provided that the first two drawings under the Bridge Facility are made within 90 days after the Tender Offer closing. The Bridge Facility is scheduled to mature 364 days after the initial borrowing under the Bridge Facility.
     Funding under the Bridge Facility is conditioned upon the satisfaction of conditions customary in similar transactions, including (i) consummation of the Tender Offer; (ii) satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Tender Offer, including a minimum tender offer condition; and (iii) there not occurring a material adverse effect (A) since April 1, 2007 with respect to Komag and (B) since March 30, 2007 with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries.
     The obligations of WDTI under the Bridge Facility are guarantied by the Company. In addition, certain of the Company's subsequently acquired domestic subsidiaries (including Komag after consummation of the Merger) will be required to guaranty the obligations of WDTI under the Bridge Facility.
     Borrowings under the Bridge Facility will bear interest, at WDTI's option (a) at the Base Rate or (b) at the Eurodollar Rate for the applicable interest period plus 0.625%. Base Rate loans bear interest at the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of one percent, (ii) the rate of interest in effect from time to time as published in as the "prime rate," and (iii) a computed rate based on a three-week moving average rate of secondary market morning offering rates in the United States for three-month certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks, each as more full defined in the Bridge Facility. Eurodollar Rate loans bear interest at LIBOR divided by 100% minus the reserve percentage in effect for the applicable interest period under regulations issued from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for determining the maximum reserve requirement with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency liabilities having a term equal to such interest period. WDTI is also obligated to pay other facility fees and arrangement fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type, as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility.
The Wall Street Journal
 
     The Bridge Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Bridge Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI's and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Bridge Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Bridge Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Bridge Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other materials indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults.
     The agents and arrangers (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) under the Bridge Facility have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust and other advisory services to the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, for such services.
     The foregoing description of the Bridge Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bridge Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

          (g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or materially reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
          (h) If the Agent or a Lender determines, in its good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund); that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to the

Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
     Both principal and interest are payable in lawful money of the United States of America to GSCP, as Agent, at the Agent's Account, in same day funds.

     This Promissory Note and the rights and obligations of the Borrower and the Lender hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Parent's acquisition of the Shares was structured as a two-step transaction, with a cash tender offer by Offeror for the Shares (the "Offer") followed by the merger of Offeror with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger").
     The Offer expired at 7:00 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, September 5, 2007. Based on information provided by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the Offer, 28,894,569 Shares were tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer (including Shares tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery), representing approximately 95.2% of the Company's outstanding Shares (or approximately 86.6% of the Company's outstanding Shares, excluding Shares tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery). Together with the Shares indirectly owned by Parent pursuant to the exercise of a top-up option, Parent controls in excess of 90% of the outstanding Shares. The Offeror accepted all of the properly tendered Shares on September 5, 2007, at a price of $32.25 per Share, net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes (the "Offer Price"). The funds used by Offeror to purchase the Shares were from working capital and proceeds received by the Offeror in connection with a debt financing with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
     On September 5, 2007, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Offeror was merged with and into the Company, and each outstanding Share not tendered in the Offer (other than Shares held by the Parent, Offeror, the Company and stockholders who properly perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and changed its name to WD Media, Inc.
2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     As previously reported in Parent's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 30, 2007, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. ("WDTI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Bridge Facility") with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as administrative agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as arrangers.
     On September 5, 2007, WDTI borrowed an aggregate of approximately $750.0 million under the Bridge Facility to fund the Offer Price to be paid for Shares tendered and accepted in the Offer and for payment for the remaining Shares in connection with the Merger.
     The information set forth in Item 2.03 of Parent's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 30, 2007 and a copy of the Bridge Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 thereto, are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. The foregoing summary description of the Bridge Facility is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Bridge Facility.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events
     On September 5, 2007, Parent issued a press release regarding the expiration of the Offer and the completion of the Merger. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
     Parent will cause the Company, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture dated as of March 28, 2007 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture") governing the Company's outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "Notes"), to send to holders of the Notes a Fundamental Change Notice giving the holders of the Notes the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes at a cash price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date. Parent currently expects that the Fundamental Change Purchase Date will be December 5, 2007. This information does not constitute a Fundamental Change Notice, which notice and Fundamental Change Purchase Date will be given in the manner specified in the Indenture.

Our goal of profitable growth is enhanced by now having both head and media operations integrated into our hard drive business."
Coyne added, "WD has a proven track record of integrating a component business into our core HDD operations as evidenced by our assimilation of magnetic heads beginning in 2003. We believe that our new highly skilled media team  with their significant experience in perpendicular magnetic recording media and their focus on operational excellence  will be an excellent fit with the rest of WD's hard drive operations."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
Lake Forest, Calif.  Sept. 10, 2007  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today provided an update to its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which ends Sept. 28, 2007. On a standalone, non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of its recently completed acquisition of Komag, Inc., WD now expects revenue of between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, gross margin of approximately 17.5 percent, operating expenses of approximately $135 million and earnings per share between $0.61 and $0.65.
WD's original outlook for the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact of the Sept. 5, 2007, acquisition of Komag, was presented on July 26, 2007. That outlook projected revenue of between $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion, gross margin of between 15.5 percent and 16 percent, operating expenses of approximately $126 million and earnings per share between $0.43 and $0.47.
Improvements in demand, product mix and pricing thus far in the September quarter are the primary factors driving the improved outlook.
Factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Komag, WD's consolidated GAAP guidance for the September quarter is for revenue of between $1.63 billion and $1.68 billion and gross margin of approximately 17 percent. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $195 million, including a one-time charge for in-process research and development of approximately $50 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be between $0.34 and $0.38.
The company had previously indicated in late June that it expected the Komag acquisition to be accretive to earnings by the first quarter of fiscal 2009, excluding the impact of incremental depreciation and amortization of acquisition-related asset valuation adjustments. WD now expects this crossover point to occur during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, one quarter earlier than previously indicated.
Conference Call Today
A conference call to discuss the acquisition and WD's updated outlook will be held today at 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT. The conference call will be accessible live or on an archived basis via the link below:

The expected gross margin of approximately 17.5 percent is a non-GAAP measure that excludes approximately $10 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisition-related asset valuation adjustments offset by a benefit of approximately $8 million on media operations from Sept. 5 through Sept. 28.
Gross Margin

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
     LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Nov. 1, 2007  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $1.766 billion, comprised of $1.726 billion of hard drive revenue and $40 million revenue from media and substrate sales. Hard drive revenue grew by 37 percent over the prior-year comparative period on shipments of 29.4 million units, an increase of 29 percent in unit volume.
     GAAP net income for the quarter was $69 million, or $.31 per share. This includes net non-recurring tax charges of $60 million related to WD's ongoing hard drive operations and the results of the company's newly acquired media operations from Sept. 5 through Sept. 28, 2007, including acquisition-related, in-process research and development charges of $49 million.
     Excluding the non-recurring tax charges, non-GAAP consolidated net income was $129 million, or $.58 per share. Excluding the tax charges and the impact of the Komag acquisition, non-GAAP HDD revenue was $1.726 billion, unit shipments were 29.4 million and non-GAAP HDD net income was $182 million, or $.81 per share. A year ago, the company reported first quarter

revenue of $1.264 billion, unit shipments of 22.7 million, and net income of $103 million, or $.46 per share.
     In Q1, while achieving strong quarter-over-quarter growth in the high-volume desktop market, the company for the first time derived more than half its quarterly hard drive revenue from non-desktop PC applications. Fifty-three percent of hard drive revenue was from these applications, including notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications and branded product retail sales. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 35 percent non-desktop PC revenue.
     The company's unit shipments for the first quarter included approximately 5.9 million 2.5-inch hard drives for mobile applications and approximately 3.7 million 3.5-inch hard drives for use in digital video recorders. Branded products accounted for 18 percent of Q1 revenue, continuing to demonstrate the value of WD's global brand leadership.
     The company generated $219 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, ending with total cash and short-term investments of $851 million. The company borrowed $750 million on its $1.25 billion bridge financing facility to help fund the Komag acquisition.
     "Our first quarter results reflect the WD team's strong execution in a strong market for hard drives across all applications, regions and channels," said John Coyne, WD's president and chief executive officer. "We continue to reap the benefits of our investments and deployment of leading technologies over the last several years, enabling us to address customer demand for mainstream and higher capacity hard drives in consumer and commercial applications."

     (a) Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question and which shall have been held by and registered in the name of the stockholder on the books of this Corporation on the date fixed pursuant to Section 2.10 of these By-laws as the record for the determination of stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting.
     (b) Shares of its own stock belonging to this Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by this Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes.

Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of this Corporation the pledgor shall have expressly empowered the pledge to vote thereon.

A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
 
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. The attendance at any meeting of a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy which is not irrevocable shall not have the effect of revoking the same, unless the stockholder shall attend the meeting and vote in person or deliver to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. At any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum is present all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to this Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to this Corporation or its securities, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting power of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as required by applicable law.

2.11 Stockholder Proposals and Nominations.
     (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          (i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board or (C) by any stockholder of this Corporation who was a stockholder of record of this Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a proposal or director nomination to be considered at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2005 Annual Meeting"), stockholders must give written notice of any proposal or nomination of a director to the Secretary of this Corporation at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 120 days prior to the scheduled date of the 2005 Annual Meeting, regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of the 2005 Annual Meeting to a later date. The 2005 Annual Meeting is currently scheduled for November 17, 2005. Stockholder proposals or nominations for director that do not meet the notice requirements set forth above will not be acted upon at the 2005 Annual Meeting.
          (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 2.11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of this Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one
 
hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by this Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (1) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (2) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on this Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of this Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of this Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.11 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified this Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by this Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. This Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of this Corporation.
          (iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by this Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this
 
Section 2.11 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by this Corporation.
     (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of this Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. In the event this Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in this Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     (c) General.
          (i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of this Section 2.11) and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.11, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed
 
business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by this Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
          (ii) For purposes of this Section 2.11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by this Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.11. Nothing in this Section 2.11 shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in this Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
     The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of this Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
2.12
Conduct of Meetings.
 
     Subject to the requirements of the General Corporation Law, the property, business and affairs of this Corporation shall be managed by the Board.
3.01
General Powers
.
     The Board shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. Directors need not be stockholders. Each of the directors of this Corporation shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws.
3.02
Number and Term of Office
.
     The directors shall be elected annually by the stockholders of this Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.05 below, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at any annual or special meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, up to the number of directors to be elected, shall be the directors. For purposes of this Section 3.03, a "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. If an incumbent director is not reelected but would otherwise remain in office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board, which may be conditioned upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board. If a resignation is so conditioned, the Governance Committee of the Board, or such other committee designated by the Board pursuant to Section 3.14 below, will evaluate any such resignation in light of the best interests of this Corporation and its stockholders and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject such resignation or whether other action should be taken with respect thereto. In making its recommendation, such committee may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to this Corporation, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause this Corporation to fail to satisfy or otherwise comply with any applicable rule or regulation (including NYSE listing requirements and federal securities laws). The Board will act on the recommendation of such committee and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board or Board committee.
3.03
Election of Directors
.
     If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the election of directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, the incumbent Board will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote at the prior meeting. In this circumstance, the incumbent Board will continue to serve until new directors are duly elected and qualified.
     Any director of this Corporation may resign at any time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board or to the Secretary of this Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or, if the time
3.04
Resignations
.
 
be not specified, it shall take effect immediately upon its receipt by the Board or the Secretary; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
     Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancy in the Board, whether because of death, resignation, disqualification, an increase in the number of directors, or any other cause, may be filled by vote of the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders. Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by the General Corporation Law.
3.05
Vacancies
.
     The Board may hold any of its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board may from time to time by resolution designate or as shall be designated by the person or persons calling the meeting or in the notice or a waiver of notice of any such meeting. Directors may participate in any regular or special meeting of the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment pursuant to which all persons participating in the meeting of the Board can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
3.06
Place of Meeting, Etc
.
     The Board shall meet as soon as practicable after each annual election of directors and notice of such first meeting shall not be required, provided a quorum shall be present; or such meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board, or as shall be specified in a waiver given by each person entitled to notice.
3.07
First Meeting
.
     Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and places as the Board shall from time to time by resolution determine. If any day fixed for a regular meeting shall be a legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday.
3.08
Regular Meetings
.
     Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or any two directors. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least twenty-four (24) hours before the special meeting.
3.09
Special Meetings
.
     Except as otherwise provided in these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, the presence of a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board, and all matters shall be decided at any such meeting, a quorum being present, by the affirmative votes of a majority of the directors present.

Exhibit 99.2
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Komag, Incorporated:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Komag, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement Schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Komag, Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2006 upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
Share-Based Payment.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Komag, Incorporated:
 
We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, that Komag, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Komag, Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement Schedule II. Our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

Company Business:
 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Consolidation:
 
  The Company uses a fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The Company's 2006 and 2005 fiscal years were years. The Company's 2004 fiscal year was a year; accordingly, the additional week in 2004 was included in the Company's first quarter of 2004.
Fiscal Year:
52-53 week

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

  Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for (a) all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date and (b) for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The Company elected to amortize stock-based compensation for awards outstanding and unvested on its adoption of SFAS 123R as well as for awards granted on or after its adoption of SFAS 123R on a straight line basis over the requisite service (vesting) period for the entire award. The vesting period for stock options has generally been four years and the vesting for stock purchase rights generally has been three years.
Stock-Based Compensation:
Share-Based Payment
 
Prior to January 2, 2006 and as permitted under SFAS No. 123, (SFAS 123), the Company elected to follow APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options and stock purchase rights was measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS No. 148, , prior to fiscal 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure of the effect on net income and earnings per share had the fair value method been used, as prescribed by SFAS 123.

  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and the forecast of future taxable income, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
Income Taxes:
 
  Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period for non-owner transactions, and is composed of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are excluded from earnings under current accounting standards. The Company's other comprehensive loss included the unrealized losses, net of income taxes, related to the Company's foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges.
Comprehensive Income:
 
  The Company determines net income per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and stock purchase rights is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of outstanding contingently convertible debt is reflected in diluted net
Computation of Net Income Per Share:
 
 
 
income per share by application of the if-converted method. Interest expense related to the contingently convertible debt is an adjustment to income available to common stockholders for the diluted net income per share calculations.
 
The following table sets forth the computation of net income per share. The table is in thousands, except per share amounts.
 
 
Outstanding common stock options that were not included in the diluted net income per share computation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive were approximately 42,000 in 2006, zero in 2005, and approximately 264,000 in 2004.
 
In January 2004, the Company issued $80.5 million of 2.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the Notes). The Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion price of $26.40, or approximately 3,049,000 shares. These shares have been included in the Company's diluted earnings per share calculations for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.
 
  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for inventory when there are abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials. Under existing generally accepted accounting principles, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and re-handling costs may be "so abnormal" as to require treatment as current period charges rather than recorded as adjustments to the value of the inventory. SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement are

effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted this pronouncement at the beginning of fiscal year 2006. The adoption of SFAS 151 had no material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces APB No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. The reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by SFAS 154. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS 154 in fiscal 2006. The adoption of this standard had no material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
 
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance on recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this Interpretation to have a material impact on its financial statements.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation or determined the impact of adopting SFAS 157.
Fair Value Measurement
 
In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, (SAB 108), which addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when quantifying errors in current-year financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to consider the effect of all carry over and reversing effects of prior-year misstatements when quantifying errors in current-year financial statements. SAB 108 allows companies to record the effects of adopting the guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and there was no financial impact on its financial statements.
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements
 
 
The Company operates in one business segment, which is the development, production, and marketing of high-performance thin-film media (disks) for use in hard disk drives. The Company primarily sells to original equipment manufacturers in the rigid disk drive market. The Company's operations are treated as one operating segment, as the Company reports profit and loss information on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision-maker of the Company.
 
 
 
 
Summary information for the Company's operations by geographic location is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
External sales by geographic location, which is determined by the customers' sold-to address, are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 
Most of the Company's sales are derived from a relatively small number of customers, which results in a concentration of credit risk regarding trade receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, and generally requires no collateral for sales to these customers. Based on management's evaluation of potential credit losses and the relative strength of the disk drive industry, the Company believes that an allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2006 is not required.
 
 
 
Seagate accounted for $57.9 million of the Company's accounts receivable at December 31, 2006, and 36% of its net sales for 2006 (Seagate acquired Maxtor in May of 2006 and therefore we have reflected sales to Maxtor in the Seagate numbers for all of 2006). Western Digital accounted for $46.1 million of the Company's accounts receivable at December 31, 2006, and 37% of its net sales for 2006. Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST) accounted for $28.5 million of the Company's accounts receivable at December 31, 2006, and 23% of its net sales for 2006.
 
The Company's customers are concentrated in the disk drive industry. Accordingly, the Company's future success depends on the buying patterns of these customers and the continued demand by these customers for the Company's products. Additionally, the disk drive market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in end user requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The Company's continued success will depend upon its ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce, on a timely basis, new products and features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. Furthermore, as a result of its international sales, the Company's operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad, including but not limited to, fluctuations in the value of currency, longer payment cycles, and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.
 
Because of the Company's small customer base, the loss of any one significant customer would have a material impact on the Company's business operations. During the second quarter of 2006, Seagate acquired Maxtor Corporation (Maxtor). Sales to Seagate for all of 2006 include sales to Maxtor. The Company expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of our sales from these customers, and from a small number of other customers. We entered into supply agreements, including certain amendments to these agreements, with Western Digital, Maxtor and Seagate in 2005, and with HGST in the first quarter of 2006. The supply agreement with Maxtor was assigned to Seagate as a result of Seagate's acquisition of Maxtor in May 2006. Under the supply agreements, the Company supplies certain media volumes subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements. The customers are required to pay certain advances to the Company covering future purchases of media from the Company. The customer advances, which totaled $127.2 million and $102.9 million as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively, are to be repaid to the customers via a credit of a specified dollar amount per disk on future sales.
 
Significant customers accounted for the following percentages of net sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004:
 
 
 
 
The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for some of the materials and equipment used in its manufacturing processes, including aluminum blanks, aluminum substrates, nickel plating solutions, polishing and texturing supplies, and sputtering target materials. Kobe Steel, Ltd. is the Company's primary supplier of aluminum blanks, which is a fundamental component in producing disks. The Company also relies on Heraeus Incorporated and Williams Advanced Materials, Incorporated for its sputtering target requirements, and on OMG Fidelity, Incorporated for supplies of nickel plating solutions.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company maintains a savings and deferred profit sharing plan. Employees in the United States who meet certain criteria are eligible to participate. In addition to voluntary employee contributions to the plan, the Company matches a portion of each employee's contributions to the plan, up to a maximum amount. The Company contributed a total of $1.4 million to the plan in 2006, $2.2 million in 2005, and $0.8 million in 2004. Plan expenses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Prior to 2006, the Company had established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reassessed the valuation allowance previously established and determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized in 2007. As a result, the Company released a portion of the
 
 
 
allowance resulting in an income tax benefit of $7.0 million and a credit to equity of $0.8 million in 2006. The Company will continue to assess the potential realization of the remaining deferred tax assets, and will adjust the valuation allowance in future periods, as appropriate. The recorded valuation allowance against deferred tax assets decreased by $7.7 million in 2006, increased by $4.9 million in 2005, and increased by $3.4 million in 2004. Approximately $7.3 million of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2006 was attributable to the federal and state income tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid in capital when, and if, realized.
 
Pursuant to Statement SFAS No. 123R, excess tax benefits associated with the stock awards are not recognized until the associated tax deduction reduces cash taxes payable. As such, the Company has been tracking the deductions attributable to these excess benefits separately. The additional tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to the stock awards was $5.5 million in 2006. These excess benefits will not be recognized as a credit to additional paid in capital until such deduction reduces tax payable.
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company has unrecognized deferred tax assets generated prior to the Company's reorganization in 2002 of approximately $94.5 million. Upon realization of those deferred tax assets, the Company first reduces intangible assets associated with the reorganization to zero and then credits additional paid-in capital. In 2006, the Company utilized $2.9 million of pre-emergence deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable. In 2005 and 2004, the Company utilized $4.9 million and $1.0 million pre-emergence deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable, respectively. These deferred tax assets were previously fully reserved by a valuation allowance. The benefit of realizing these deferred tax assets was credited to additional paid-in capital in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $208.5 million and $78.5 million, which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income through 2026 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the Company had various federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $46.0 millionof which $13.9 million are available to offset future taxable income through 2026, and the remaining $32.1 million are available indefinitely.
,
 
The utilization of the Company's net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to certain annual limitations due to the ownership change, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation on these NOL's and credits are $8.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for losses and credits generated before June 30, 2002.
 
The Company's Malaysian manufacturing facilities operate under various tax holidays. The net impact of these tax holidays increased the Company's net income by $47.7 million ($1.59 per basic share and $1.42 per diluted share) in 2006, $41.1 million ($1.42 per basic share and $1.24 per diluted share) in 2005, and $25.1 million ($0.92 per basic share and $0.81 per diluted share) in 2004. In July 2005, the Malaysian government agreed to reset the expiration dates of the existing tax holidays to December 2006 and approved a new, tax holiday covering all of the Company's Malaysian operations. The new tax holiday commences in January 2007 and expires in December 2016.
10-year
 
A substantial majority of the Company's income is generated by its foreign subsidiaries covered by tax holidays. No federal and state income taxes have been provided on the net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries, which, as of December 31, 2006, amounted to $291.3 million. The net undistributed earnings are intended to finance local operating requirements and to satisfy the intercompany payables to the parent company and are therefore considered permanently reinvested.
 
 
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair values as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, due to the relatively short period to maturity of these instruments.
 
 
 
 
As of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, the fair value of the Company's Convertible Subordinated Notes was $115.9 million and $109.9 million, respectively. These values were based on the quoted price of the Notes (which are traded in the open market) as of the last business day of the Company's 2006 and 2005 fiscal years.
 
 
The following table (in thousands) summarizes accrued expenses and other liabilities for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:
 
 
 
The Company entered into supply agreements, including certain amendments to these agreements, with three major customers in 2005, and another major customer in the first quarter of 2006. Under the supply agreements, the Company supplies certain media volumes subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements. The customers are required to pay certain advances covering future purchases of media from the Company. The customer advances, which totaled $127.2 million and $102.9 million as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively, are to be repaid to the customers via a credit of a specified dollar amount per disk on future sales. During 2006 and 2005, customer advance credits applied to purchases of media were $119.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and additional customer advance payments were $143.8 million and $104.3 million, respectively. The agreements generally provide for repayment at the end of the term of the agreement if not fully paid by credits applied to purchases. The terms of the current arrangements expire on various dates through December 2009.
 
 
In January 2004, the Company completed an offering of $80.5 million of 2.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the Notes). The Notes mature on February 1, 2024, bear interest at 2.0%, and require semiannual interest payments beginning on August 1, 2004. The Notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances, into shares of the Company's common stock based on an initial effective conversion price of $26.40. Holders of the Notes may convert the Notes into shares of the Company's common stock prior to maturity if: 1) the sale price of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds $31.68 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period within any fiscal quarter of the Company; 2) the trading price of the Notes falls below a specified threshold prior to February 19, 2019; 3) the Notes have been called for redemption; or 4) specified corporate transactions (as described in the offering prospectus for the Notes) occur. The conditions for conversion have been met, and the debt is currently convertible. The Company may redeem the Notes on or after February 6, 2007, at specified declining redemption premiums. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes on February 1, 2011, 2014, or 2019, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
There are no financial covenants, guarantees, or collateral associated with the Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company incurred $3.1 million of loan fees. The loan fees, which are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the Notes. On December 31, 2006, unamortized loan fees were $2.6 million.
20-year
 
The Company has arranged bank guarantees of Malaysian ringgit 29.5 million (approximately $8.4 million) which are required by Malaysian utility companies and other Malaysian vendors. There is no expiration date on the bank guarantees. No interest will be charged on the bank guarantees, but there is a commission charge ranging
 
 
 
between 0.05% and 0.10% on the amount of bank guarantee utilized. As of December 31, 2006, there were no liabilities outstanding related to the bank guarantees.
 
 
The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities under SFAS 133. The assets or liabilities associated with its derivative instruments and hedging activities are recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a foreign exchange forward contract to purchase approximately $0.7 million of Japanese Yen for cash flow payments denominated in Japanese Yen for future equipment purchases. The contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge in accordance with SFAS 133. The fair value of the Company's forward contract was recorded as a $23 thousand other current liability as of December 31, 2006. Fair value is determined by a dealer quote. The effectiveness of the contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges is assessed quarterly through an evaluation of critical terms and other criteria required by SFAS 133. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or (loss), net of any tax effects, in stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassified into depreciation expense over the useful life of the purchased equipment. In 2006, the hedges were perfectly effective and no ineffectiveness in hedges occurred.
 
The Company's foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of less than 12 months. The Company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2006, forward contracts used for purchases of raw materials are not accounted for at fair value under the normal purchases exception provided in SFAS 133.
 
 
Common Stock
 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company is authorized to issue 120.0 million shares of common stock. The following shares of common stock are reserved for future issuance (in thousands):
 
 
Amended and Restated 2002 Qualified Stock Plan
 
The 2002 Qualified Stock Plan (the 2002 Stock Plan) provides for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company's employees, and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units to the Company's employees, directors, and consultants. The term for stock options granted may not exceed 10 years. In May 2005, shareholders voted to terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and transfer the remaining 317,054 unissued shares that were previously reserved under the ESPP to the 2002 Stock Plan. In May 2006, the Company increased the number of shares reserved for issuance by 5,000,000 shares from 4,242,054 shares to 9,242,054 shares.
 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had authorized a total of 9,242,054 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a net balance of 5,390,492 shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan. Of the 5,390,492 shares reserved for future issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan, 12,500 are for stock purchase rights deferred under the Deferred
 
 
 
Compensation Plan, 485,262 are for the exercise of outstanding stock options, and 4,892,730 are for future grants of stock options and stock purchase rights.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for (a) all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date and (b) for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The Company elected to amortize stock-based compensation for awards outstanding and unvested on its adoption of SFAS 123R as well as for awards granted on or after its adoption of SFAS 123R on a straight line basis over the requisite service (vesting) period for the entire award. The vesting period for stock options has generally been four years and the vesting period for stock purchase rights generally has been three years.
 
Stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options and stock purchase rights amounted to $3.1 million and zero for 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $15.0 million and $3.2 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on January 2, 2006, the Company's income before income taxes and net income for 2006 were approximately $3.4 million and $3.3 million lower, than if it had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted net income per share for 2006 were approximately $0.10 and $0.08 lower, respectively, due to the adoption of SFAS 123R.
 
As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $27.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based compensation arrangements. The cost is expected to be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the stock-based awards through the third quarter of 2010. The weighted average remaining vesting period is approximately two years.
 
Summary of Assumptions and Activity
 
In 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $3.1 million and zero, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to stock options. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of option grants in 2006: risk-free interest rate of 4.80%; expected volatility of the market price of the Company's common stock of 54.3%; no dividend yield, and a weighted-average expected life of 4.0 years. The fair value of options granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $18.10, $11.57 and $7.02 per share, respectively. Options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock were granted in 2006.
 
Compensation expense related to stock options is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of 48 months. As of December 31, 2006, the unamortized fair value of unvested stock options was $3.0 million and will be amortized on a straight line basis over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately 2.3 years.
 
 
 
 
A summary of stock option transactions is as follows:
 
 
 
 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $14.7 million, $8.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 the cash received from exercise of options was $5.6 million, $5.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Upon the exercise of options, the Company issues new common stock from its authorized shares.
 
The following table sets forth a summary of the Company's stock purchase rights for 2006:
 
 
In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $15.0 million, $3.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to stock purchase rights. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 123R related to applying an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested stock purchase rights outstanding on the date of adoption was a $0.2 million credit, which was credited to operating costs and expenses. The Company determines the fair value of stock purchase rights based on the Nasdaq closing stock price on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock purchase rights is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of 36 months (one-third vests annually upon the anniversary date of the grant date). As of December 31, 2006, the unamortized fair value of
 
 
 
unvested restricted stock awards was $24.1 million and will be amortized on a straight line basis over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately 1.8 years.
 
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company announced the anticipated retirement of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), which became effective on October 1, 2006. Certain agreements were entered into with the CEO as a result of the anticipated retirement. These agreements were filed as exhibits to the filed for the year ended January 1, 2006. Under the agreements, the vesting of certain stock options and stock purchase rights were accelerated to provide additional compensation in connection with the CEO's retirement and for his assistance during a planned transition period. The Company recorded an additional $5.1 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the modification of the CEO's stock options and stock purchase rights for 2006, respectively. Effective October 1, 2006, Timothy Harris, the Company's then-Chief Operating Officer, became the Company's new CEO. The Company's then-CEO retired effective as of such date, and continued to provide transitional consulting services to the Company for three months.

Pro forma information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS 123R
 
Prior to January 2, 2006 and as permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company elected to follow APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options and stock purchase rights was measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS No. 148, , prior to fiscal 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure of the effect on net income and earnings per share had the fair value method been used, as prescribed by SFAS 123.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an Amendment of SFAS 123
 
The following table reflects the effect on the Company's net income and income per share had the fair value method been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in 2005 and 2004. The table is in thousands, except per share amounts.
 
 
For pro forma disclosure purposes, the Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option and stock purchase right grant on the date of grant.
 
 
 
 
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of option grants in fiscal 2005 and 2004:
 
 
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of employee purchase rights under the Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 2005, and 2004:
 
 
Because the Company does not pay out dividends, no dividend yield was included in the fair value calculation.
 
Deferred Compensation Plan
 
Employees at or above the director level are eligible to participate in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides for the deferral of stock purchase rights. Eligible employees may elect to defer any stock purchase rights they are eligible to receive during any calendar year the plan remains in effect. All deferrals must equal 100% of the shares to be awarded at the fair market value, calculated on the date of grant, of the stock purchase rights that would have otherwise been received. Distributions shall be paid in the form of shares of the Company's common stock at such time as may be elected by each participant.
 
As of December 31, 2006, the issuance of 12,500 shares have been deferred in accordance with the Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
Warrants
 
In June 2002, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The warrants were exercisable until June 30, 2005 and had an exercise price of $9.00. In 2003 through 2005, approximately 992,000 warrants were exercised, and approximately 300,000 were surrendered in lieu of paying cash upon the exercise of certain warrants. The remaining approximate 8,000 warrants which expired as of June 30, 2005 were cancelled.
 
 
The Company leases a research and administrative facility under an operating lease that expires in 2014. The lease includes two renewal options of five years each.
 
 
 
 
As of December 31, 2006, the future minimum commitments for the non-cancelable operating facility lease, and non-cancelable equipment leases, are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Rental expense for all operating leases was $3.4 million in 2006, $3.5 million in 2005, and $3.9 million in 2004.
 
During 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $0.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of deferred rent related to the Company's renewal of its leased headquarters facility in San Jose, California. As of December 31, 2006, the deferred rent balance was $3.1 million.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stock Purchase Rights and Stock Options
 
On February 15, 2007, the Company's Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors approved the grant of a total of 380,854 stock purchase rights with an exercise price of $0.01 to employees. Of this total, 313,881 was to non-officers and 66,973 was to officers. The vesting for the stock purchase rights granted is one-third at the end of each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the employee continuing to be a service provider. In addition, 180,819 stock options were granted to officers with an exercise price of $32.10. The vesting for the stock options granted is one-third at the end of the first anniversary of the date of grant and  each month thereafter.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ITEM 1. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
 
 
 
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Komag, Incorporated (the Company), a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States of America (US) generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US generally accepted accounting principles. While the financial information furnished is unaudited, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position, operating results, and cash flows for the periods presented, have been included. Operating results for the six months ended July 1, 2007, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 30, 2007. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements:
     The Company uses a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The Company's 2007 fiscal year will include 52 weeks. The three-month and six-month reporting periods included in this report include 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively.
Fiscal Year:
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, and consist of the following (in thousands):
Inventories:
     : In the second quarter of 2007, the Company commenced hedging a portion of its forecasted ringgit based expenses to help mitigate short term exposure to fluctuations of the currency by entering foreign exchange forward rate contracts. We account for our derivative and hedging activities under SFAS No. 133,
Derivative Financial Instruments
Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities
 
(SFAS 133). The assets or liabilities associated with our derivative instruments and hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current liabilities, respectively, in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
     A majority of our sales, expense, and capital purchasing activities is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a large portion of our payroll, certain manufacturing and operating expenses, and inventory and capital purchases is transacted in the Malaysian ringgit (ringgit), subjecting us to foreign currency risk. We enter foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted expenses denominated in ringgit. In addition, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with ringgit denominated liabilities.
     : All hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts, excluding time value, is assessed monthly using regression analysis. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. The gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into operating expenses in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The effective portion of gains or losses on hedges recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of each quarter will be reclassified to earnings within 12 months. The ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reported immediately in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in cost of goods sold.
Cash Flow Hedging Activities
     During the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded less than $0.1 million of net unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments to accumulated other comprehensive income. There were no reclassifications to operating expenses during the second quarter of 2007. The ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value was not material. The loss representing time value excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness was less than $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2007, which is included in cost of goods sold in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of July 1, 2007, we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase approximately $87.4 million in ringgit. As of July 1, 2007, these foreign currency forward contracts outstanding had a fair value of $0.6 million, included in other current liabilities and a fair value of $0.5 million, included in other current assets.
     Some of the Company's foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133. Accordingly, any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are reported immediately in cost of goods sold. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign-currency-denominated liabilities, which are also reported in cost of goods sold, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Non-designated Hedging Activities:
     Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss)
Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per Share:
 
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and unvested common stock is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of outstanding contingently convertible debt is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the if-converted method. Interest expense related to the contingently convertible debt is an adjustment to income available to common stockholders for the diluted net income per share calculation.
     The computation of diluted net loss per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2007 excludes the interest adjustment related to the contingently convertible debt of $1.6M and common stock equivalents of 4.8 million shares of common stock since their inclusion would be antidilutive.
     The following table sets forth the computation of net income (loss) per share. The table is in thousands, except per share amounts.
     In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance on recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted this pronouncement beginning in fiscal year 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 had no material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, (SFAS 157)SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation or determined the impact of adopting SFAS 157.
Fair Value Measurement
.
 
     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses be reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation or determined the impact of adopting SFAS 159.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Note 2. Common Stock
     The Company repurchased and retired 0.5 million and 4.3 million shares of Company common stock at an average share price of $27.71 and $32.18, for a total cost of $13.8 million and $138.8 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2007, respectively. These share repurchases are part of a March 2007 share repurchase authorization by the board of directors for an amount up to $200 million. The Company does not expect to repurchase additional shares under this authorization as the Merger Agreement prohibits such stock repurchases (see Note 8 on Proposed Acquisition). The Company immediately retired the shares repurchased, which decreased common stock by $5,000 and $43,000 for the par value of the common stock retired, additional paid-in capital by $5.4 million and $40.3 million and retained earnings by $8.4 million and $98.5 million, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2007, respectively. In addition, the Company has made periodic repurchases of common stock in connection with an employee stock plan.
Note 3. Concentration of Customer, Supplier, and Geographic Risk
     The following table reflects the percentage of the Company's net sales by major customer (2):
 
     The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for some of the materials and equipment used in its manufacturing processes, including aluminum blanks, aluminum substrates, nickel plating solutions, polishing and texturing supplies, and sputtering target materials. Kobe Steel, Ltd. is the Company's primary supplier of aluminum blanks, which is a fundamental component in producing disks. The Company also relies on Heraeus Incorporated and Williams Advanced Materials, Incorporated for its sputtering target requirements, and on OMG Fidelity, Incorporated for supplies of nickel plating solutions.
 
     A majority of the Company's long-lived assets is located at its Malaysian manufacturing facilities. These assets totaled $497.9 million as of July 1, 2007, and $506.2 million as of December 31, 2006. The majority of the Company's sales is delivered to manufacturing facilities located in Asia.
Note 4. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
     The following table (in thousands) summarizes accrued expenses and other liabilities balances at July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2006:
Note 5. Customer Advances
     The Company has supply agreements with each of its major customers. Under the supply agreements, the Company supplies certain media volumes subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements. The customers provided cash advances covering future purchases of media from the Company. The customer advances, which totaled $79.0 million and $127.2 million as of July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, are to be repaid to the customers based on a specified dollar amount per disk purchased. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2007, customer advances repaid to customers were $22.1 million and $48.3 million, respectively. The agreements generally provide for repayment at the end of the term of the agreement if not fully paid in connection with purchases. The terms of the current arrangements expire on various dates through December 2009.
Note 6. Debt
Conversion of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024
     On March 28, 2007, the Company called for redemption on April 17, 2007, all $80.5 million of then outstanding principal amount of its 2.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the Notes). All of the Notes were converted into 3.0 million shares of the Company's common stock in April 2007. In accordance with the terms of the Notes, each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes was converted into 37.8788 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the redemption, accrued interest of $0.3 million, unamortized loan issuance fees of $2.6 million and the outstanding debt balance of $80.5 million were re-classified to additional paid in capital with the exception of $30 thousand for the par value of the common stock issued, which was re-classified to common stock. The Company did not incur any gains or losses as a result of the conversion.
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014
     On March 28, 2007, the Company completed an offering of $250 million of 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the New Notes). The New Notes mature on April 1, 2014, bear interest at a rate of 2.125% per
 
annum, and require semiannual interest payments beginning on October 1, 2007. The New Notes may be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company's common stock based upon a base conversion rate of 17.2414 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. The conversion rate is equivalent to a base conversion price of approximately $58.00 per share and is subject to adjustment in certain dilution events. If at the time of conversion, the Company's common stock price exceeds the base conversion price, holders will receive up to an additional 13.2836 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, as determined pursuant to a specified formula.
     Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of the Company (which would generally include a change of control (including of our board of directors), liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the failure of our shares to be listed on a national securities exchange or other trading market), holders may require the Company to repurchase some or all of their notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Also, if a fundamental change occurs, the Company may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any notes converted in connection with such fundamental change by a specified number of shares of our common stock. On June 28, 2007, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Western Digital Corporation (Western Digital) and State M Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Digital, pursuant to which State M Corporation commenced a cash tender offer on July 11, 2007 for all outstanding shares of our common stock. If the tender offer is successfully completed, it will constitute a fundamental change. The Company does not expect that the consummation of the current tender offer would result in an increase in the conversion rate, however, the Company cannot assure you that such an increase will not be triggered since the determination is made under the indenture for the New Notes based on the average of the closing price of the Company's common stock over a five consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the fundamental change.
     There are no financial covenants or guarantees and there is no collateral associated with the New Notes. In connection with the issuance of the New Notes, the Company incurred approximately $6.8 million of loan issuance fees. The loan issuance fees, which are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the 7-year maturity of the New Notes. On July 1, 2007, unamortized loan fees were $6.6 million.
Note 7. Income Taxes
     The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48on January 1, 2007. Total unrecognized income tax benefits at the date of adoption were $0.7 million and remained unchanged from the amount of the Company's pre-implementation income tax contingency reserves. The unrecognized income tax benefits, if realized, will not affect the annual effective tax rate but will be credited to additional paid in capital.
, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48),
     Unrecognized tax benefits are expected to decrease by $0.2 million within the next 12 months due to the anticipated lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.
     Interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits will be accrued in interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. The Company has not accrued interest or penalties as of
 
the date of adoption because they are not applicable.
     The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., California, the Netherlands and Malaysia. The tax years 2000 to 2006 remain open to examination in each of these major taxing jurisdictions.
Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies
     The Company provides indemnification to customers under customer contracts for potential intellectual property infringement claims involving the Company's products. The company has received such a claim for reimbursement of legal defense costs from its customers in connection with a claim of intellectual property infringement. The Company can not currently estimate the amount of potential liability related to such claim. As of July 1, 2007, the expense incurred by the Company under customer indemnity provisions has not been material.
Note 9. Proposed Acquisition
     On June 28, 2007, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Western Digital Corporation and State M Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Digital, pursuant to which State M Corporation commenced a cash tender offer on July 11, 2007 for all outstanding shares of our common stock at a price per share of $32.25. Unless extended pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the tender offer was originally scheduled to expire on August 7, 2007, but was extended by Western Digital Corporation until September 5, 2007. In the event the tender offer is successfully completed, State M Corporation will merge with and into Komag and Komag will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Digital Corporation, and each share of Komag common stock not purchased in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive $32.25 in cash. The tender offer and merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals. We currently expect that the merger will be completed in the third quarter of 2007. The merger agreement provides for the payment by the Company of a termination fee of $38 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances in connection with a competing third-party acquisition proposal and certain other circumstances. The boards of directors of each of the Company, Western Digital and State M Corporation have unanimously approved the tender offer and the merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement. Western Digital is a significant customer of the Company (see Note 3).

 
EXHIBIT 99.5
     Western Digital Corporation ("WDC") acquired all of the outstanding common shares and stock purchase rights of Komag, Incorporated ("Komag") in a cash transaction announced on June 28, 2007 and consummated on September 5, 2007. The transaction was structured as a cash tender offer by State M Corporation ("State M"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WDC, for all outstanding shares of Komag's common stock, followed by a merger of State M and Komag whereby Komag became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WDC and changed its name to WD Media, Inc.

WDC's management has estimated the fair value of the intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration issued and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
     WDC and Komag have different fiscal year ends which end on the Friday closest to June 30 and the Sunday closest to December 31, respectively. As such, Komag's historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to those of WDC. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to Komag's historical financial statements to conform to the presentation used in WDC's historical financial statements. Such reclassifications had no effect on Komag's previously reported net income.

1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
     On June 28, 2007, WDC and Komag entered into a definitive Merger agreement and announced the merger. The transaction was consummated on September 5, 2007 through a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Komag's common stock and Komag became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WDC. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented to give effect to WDC's acquisition of Komag as if the transaction had been consummated on June 29, 2007. The statement of operations is presented as if the transaction had been consummated on July 1, 2006.
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
     The aggregate purchase price for Komag was $995 million, consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares, transaction fees, severance and other employee-related equity payments. The application of purchase accounting under SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), requires that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. The allocation process requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including fixed assets, deferred tax assets, technologies, customer contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities assumed, including contractual commitments and legal contingencies. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, and in accordance with SFAS 141 they may be adjusted as further information becomes available during the allocation period of up to 12 months from the date of the acquisition.
     Additional information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities includes, but is not limited to, changes in the timing and actual number of employees terminated, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations, the amounts required to settle them, the progress or outcomes of various litigation, and the value of deferred tax assets. Any changes in the values allocated to tangible and specifically identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period may result in material adjustments to goodwill.
     WDC identified and recorded the assets, including specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Komag at their estimated fair values at September 5, 2007, the date of the acquisition, and allocated the residual value of approximately $84 million to goodwill.
 
 
Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
     The plant and equipment acquired as part of the acquisition continues to be utilized and was valued at current replacement cost for similar assets. Land and buildings have been estimated at fair value on September 5, 2007, the date of the acquisition. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment acquired from Komag and their estimated useful lives:
Inventories
     Total inventories at September 5, 2007 included $205 million of inventory acquired through the acquisition, of which $11 million and $40 million represent finished goods and work-in-process, respectively. Finished goods and work-in-process were valued at estimated selling prices less costs of disposal, estimated reseller profit and costs to complete. In addition, total inventories at September 5, 2007 included $154 million in raw materials, primarily precious metals, acquired from Komag and is valued based on fair value at the date of the acquisition. Raw materials were valued at estimated replacement cost.
Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired
     In accordance with SFAS 141, WDC identified intangible assets apart from goodwill if one of the following criteria was met: 1) the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights; or 2) the asset is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired enterprise and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in conjunction with a related contract, asset, or liability. The recorded values and estimated useful lives of the intangibles acquired from Komag were:
     Existing technology relates to Komag's media and substrate products that have reached technological feasibility as well as a combination of Komag's processes, patents, and trade secrets developed through years of experience in the design and production of their products. Existing technology was valued using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach. This approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate from these technologies less charges related to the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The fair value of the existing technology is being amortized to Cost of Revenue over the weighted average useful life of 9.7 years.
     The fair value of customer substrate relationships was determined using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach based on the estimated revenues to be derived from Komag's customers. This approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate from these customer substrate relationships less charges related to the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The fair values of the customer substrate relationships are being amortized to Cost of Revenue over the weighted average useful life of five years.
In-Process Research and Development
     Komag had an in-process research and development project associated with technology for higher recording densities on advanced perpendicular recording media. The project is expected to incorporate significant changes in the magnetic structure of the media to achieve higher recording density. As these advanced products are not ready for commercial
 
production and have no alternative future use, the development cost did not qualify for capitalization. Accordingly, WDC recorded $49 million as a charge to research and development expense at the time of the acquisition. Costs to complete the development of this technology are expected to approximate $5 million and are expected to utilize existing engineering personnel. The technology may be necessary to remain competitive with anticipated industry advances in areal recording densities for thin-film media. The in-process research and development was valued using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach. This approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate from these technologies less costs related to the contribution of other assets to those cash flows.
  
Debt Assumed
     As a result of the acquisition, WDC assumed $250 million face value of additional debt in the form of Convertible Subordinated Notes issued by Komag on March 28, 2007. The original terms of the Notes have a maturity of April 1, 2014, and currently bear interest at an annual rate of 2.625%. In addition, the terms specify that upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of Komag (including a change of control) the Notes, at the request of the Note holder, must be repurchased for a value equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, which is December 5, 2007. Fair value of the debt was estimated to be $248 million, which represents the present value at current market interest rates considering the repayment date of December 5, 2007. Other terms of the debt which might otherwise impact its market value have been effectively eliminated due to the change of control provisions. There are no financial covenants or guarantees and there is no collateral associated with the Notes.
  
Adverse/Favorable Leasehold Interests
     In accordance with the guidance in SFAS 141, WDC analyzed its contractual facility lease to determine the fair value of the leasehold interest. An adverse leasehold position exists when the present value of the contractual rental obligation is greater than the present value of the market rental obligation, and conversely for a favorable leasehold interest. WDC recorded a favorable leasehold interest aggregating $4 million and has been classified within Other Non-current Assets in the purchase price allocation table in this footnote. The $4 million will be amortized to Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses over the remaining duration of the lease, which ends December 31, 2014.
  
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Komag Acquisition
     Under EITF 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Business Combination", WDC has accrued certain exit costs aggregating $33 million, which relate to employee severance and the cash payment for equity related liabilities due to the employment termination of Komag employees.
  
Stock-Based Compensation
     In connection with the acquisition, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Komag's common stock with an exercise price below $32.25 as of the date of the acquisition was converted into a right to receive $32.25 in cash less the exercise price of the option. In addition, each share of Komag restricted common stock granted on or before September 5, 2007 was converted into $32.25 per share in cash. These converted option and restricted stock awards are payable in cash according to their original vesting schedules. All shares of restricted stock and options remain subject to their original terms, including the terms and conditions of Komag's Amended and Restated 2002 Qualified Stock Plan, the applicable restricted stock and option agreement and the Merger Agreement. As of September 5, 2007, the future expense for the converted Komag options and restricted stock awards is $12 million, which will be expensed based on individual award vesting terms between the date of acquisition and April 2010.
 
2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
     The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet:
 
 
 
3. TAXES
     Upon the combination of the two companies, WDC expects that the companies' respective U.S. entities would be taxed in the U.S. on a consolidated basis.   Due to utilization of net operating losses and tax holidays on earnings in foreign jurisdictions, there would be no impact to the historical tax provisions used in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations.  As future income is expected from the combined U.S. entities, the Komag valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was released and credited to goodwill as of the acquisition date.  The gross value of the deferred tax assets, net of estimated tax liabilities has been reflected on the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and not in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations due to the non-recurring nature of this reduction in the valuation allowances.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At meetings with investors and analysts at an investment conference on Wednesday, December 5, 2007, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company" or "WD") executives will provide updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry and the Company's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December 5, 2007, the Company will purchase all $250,000,000 in face value of the outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "Notes"), which Notes were governed by the indenture dated as of March 28, 2007 between the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, WD Media, Inc. (formerly Komag, Incorporated) ("WD Media") and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Indenture"). The Company assumed the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes in connection with its acquisition of WD Media on September 5, 2007 (the "Acquisition").
The Acquisition constituted a "Fundamental Change" under the Indenture that allowed the holders of the Notes to obligate the Company, for a limited period of time, to purchase the Notes for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest through the purchase date. In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Company previously sent a notice to the holders of the Notes giving them the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes on the terms set forth above on December 5, 2007 (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Date").
Holders of Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000, constituting all of the Notes under the Indenture, tendered their Notes to the Company, and on December 5, 2007, the Company will pay approximately $251,200,000 to purchase the Notes, which aggregate amount includes all accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes through the Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning demand, hard drive industry assembly capacity and inventories, expectations for December quarter revenue, earnings per share and gross margin, industry performance expectations for the March quarter, progression of the Company's integration of its media operations, and retirement of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including relating to: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; actions by competitors; unexpected advances in competing technologies such as flash memory; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard drive markets; business conditions and growth in the desktop, mobile PC, enterprise, consumer electronics and external hard drive markets; pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices; the risk that the Company's business will suffer during the integration of its recently acquired media operations; failure to quickly and effectively integrate the Company's media and head technology; changes in the availability and cost of commodity materials and specialized product components that the Company does not make internally; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2007, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jan. 23, 2008  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $2.2 billion, comprised of $2.084 billion of hard drive revenue and $120 million of revenue from media and substrate sales for the second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 28, 2007. Hard drive revenue grew by 46 percent over the prior-year comparative period on shipments of approximately 34.2 million units, a year-over-year increase of 40 percent in unit volume. Net income was $305 million, or $1.35 per share. EPS grew 137 percent over the prior year. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion, unit shipments of 24.5 million and net income of $128 million, or $.57 per share.
     Fifty-four percent of Q2 hard drive revenue was derived from non-desktop PC sources, including hard drives for notebook PCs, consumer electronics, and enterprise applications, and WD branded product retail sales. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 42 percent.
     The company shipped 8.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 4.1 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market, compared with 2.7 million units in each of these markets a year ago.
 
WD Announces Q2 Revenue of $2.2 Billion and Year-Over-Year EPS Increase of 137 Percent at $1.35 Page 2
Branded products accounted for 18 percent of hard drive revenue, continuing to demonstrate the value of WD's global brand.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company generated $519 million in cash from operations during the December quarter, ending with total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $967 million. During the quarter, the company used $240 million of cash generated from operations to pay down debt acquired in the Komag acquisition.
     "We are very pleased with our December quarter results and continue to be excited about our prospects in addressing the surging global demand for high-capacity storage in multiple consumer and business markets," said John Coyne, WD president and chief executive officer. "Our performance continues to reflect crisp and timely execution by the WD team, strong demand for hard drives and a more rational competitive pricing environment. Our operational flexibility and our technology leadership in 2.5-inch mobile hard drives enabled us to quickly react to a number of attractive market and product mix opportunities throughout the December quarter."
     For the six-months ended Dec. 28, 2007, Western Digital reported revenues of $4.0 billion and hard drive shipments of 63.6 million, for increases of 48 percent and 35 percent, respectively, over the comparable prior-year period revenue of $2.7 billion and units shipments of 47.2 million. GAAP net income for the six-months was $374 million, or $1.66 per share. Excluding $49 million of non-recurring charges for acquired in-process research and development and $60 million of non-recurring tax charges in the first quarter, non-GAAP net income for the current six-month period was $483 million, or $2.15 per share. These current-period non-GAAP earnings reflect an approximately 110 percent increase over the prior-year six-month net income and earnings per share amounts of $231 million and $1.02,

respectively. There were no non-recurring items in the prior-year six-month period and therefore there is no non-GAAP measure for the prior year.
     The investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook will be broadcast live over the Internet today at 2 p.m. PST/5 p.m. EST. The call will be accessible live and on an archived basis via the link below:

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     
Credit Facility Overview
     On February 11, 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. ("WDTI"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as syndication agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as arrangers, and Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as co-documentation agents, and lenders party thereto.
     The Credit Facility provides for a $750 million unsecured loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments.
     All $750 million available under the Credit Facility was borrowed on February 11, 2008 and was used, together with additional cash from the accounts of WDTI, to repay in full the $760 million previously borrowed under the Bridge Facility (as defined and further described in Item 1.02 below) and to pay related fees and expenses.
     
Interest Rate and Fees
     Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs (the "Eurocurrency Rate") or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Base Rate"), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margin for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 0.8% to 1.125% with respect to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis.
     In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Facility, WDTI is required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder. The facility fee rate ranges from 0.20% to 0.375% per annum and is determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis. WDTI is also required to pay letter of credit fees (a) to the revolving credit facility lenders on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters of credit equal to an applicable margin in effect with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and (b) to the letter of credit issuer computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the face amount of the letter of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer's customary documentary and processing fees and charges.
     
Amortization
     Beginning on June 30, 2009, WDTI is required under the term loan facility to make regularly scheduled payments of principal in quarterly installments equal to a percentage of the original principal amount of the term loan as follows: 3.75% per quarter for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2009, September 30, 2009, December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, 5% per quarter for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, 6.25% per quarter for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012, and 10% per quarter for each of the three quarters ended June 30, 2012, September 30,
Table of Contents
2012 and December 31, 2012, with the balance due and payable at maturity on February 11, 2013.
     
Certain Covenants and Events of Default
     The Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI's and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults.
     
Guarantees
     The obligations of WDTI under the Credit Facility are guarantied by the Company and WDTI's wholly-owned subsidiary, WD Media, Inc.
     
Certain Relationships
     The agents and arrangers (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) under the Credit Facility have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, hedging, leasing, trust and advisory services to the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, for such services.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     As previously described in Item 1.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 31, 2007, which description is incorporated by reference herein pursuant to General Instruction B.3 of Form 8-K, the Company entered into a credit agreement on August 30, 2007 with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as administrative agent, Citicorp Global Capital Markets and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as arrangers, that provided for a $1.25 billion unsecured bridge loan (such credit agreement, as amended on November 5, 2007, is referred to herein as the "Bridge Facility").

Table of Contents
At an investment community event today, February 27, 2008, executives of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") will provide investors with an update regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry and the Company's expected March quarter performance. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:
In the segments of the hard drive market addressed by the Company, overall demand and pricing in the March quarter are reflecting expected seasonality, compared with the typically stronger December quarter.
 - 
Industry inventory is well controlled. For 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch SATA & PATA drives, manufacturers' finished goods inventory is approximately 3 weeks, while inventory in the distribution and retail channels is within the long-stated manageable range of 4 to 6 weeks.
 - 
The Company's performance thus far is better than originally anticipated going into the March quarter, based on strong execution and its leading product and technology portfolios.
 - 
The Company now expects revenues in the March quarter in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.075 billion (which includes approximately $75 million in media and substrate sales), gross margin of approximately 22% and earnings per share of between $1.05 and $1.11. This compares with revenue of $1.4 billion, gross margin of 15.8% and earnings per share of $0.53 in the year-ago quarter.
 - 
Demand and supply balance and competitive behavior throughout the remainder of the quarter will, as is typical, be key factors in determining the ultimate financial outcome of the quarter for the Company.
 - 
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning conditions in the hard drive industry, the Company's expectations regarding pricing, demand and inventory in the hard drive industry, the effects of seasonality of the March quarter, the Company's business performance during the March quarter, and the Company's anticipated revenue, earnings per share and gross margin for the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; actions by competitors; unexpected advances in competing technologies; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard drive markets; business conditions and growth in the desktop, mobile PC, enterprise, consumer electronics and external hard drive markets; pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices; failure to continue to integrate the Company's media and head technologies; changes in the availability and cost of commodity materials and product components that the Company does not make internally; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 5, 2008, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 20, 2008, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced that the majority of its media and substrate supply obligations to external customers related to its acquisition of Komag in September 2007 will be fulfilled by May 2008, as planned, and that consequently the Company will streamline its media and substrate operations to serve only its own hard drive business. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. As part of the realignment of media manufacturing resources, the Company will focus its Penang, Malaysia facilities solely on the production of magnetic media, while substrate plating and polishing operations, currently in Penang, will be consolidated into the Companys two other Malaysian substrate facilities in Kuching and Johor Bahru, maximizing operational efficiencies. Additionally, some positions in the Companys San Jose, California, development and media operations facility will be affected with the cessation of external business. As a result of these actions, the Company will reduce its labor force by approximately 800 employees, approximately 770 in Malaysia and approximately 30 in the United States, representing less than 2 percent of the Companys total worldwide employee population of approximately 42,500. The total cost of these actions is currently estimated to be approximately $16 million, consisting of termination benefits of $8 million and asset impairment charges of $8 million. Of these amounts, approximately $8 million will result in future cash expenditures. The portion of these costs, if any, that will be charged against the Companys third quarter operating results and the portion, if any, that will be reflected as an adjustment to the Komag acquisition purchase price allocation is still being determined and will be separately disclosed during the Companys third quarter earnings release conference call in April 2008. To the exte nt the costs meet the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, the costs will not impact earnings.

We remain very enthusiastic about our opportunities in the fast-growing hard drive industry in the years ahead."
     For the nine-months ended Mar. 28, 2008, WD reported revenues of $6.1 billion and hard drive shipments of 98.1 million, for increases of 48 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the comparable prior-year period revenue of $4.1 billion and unit shipments of 71.7 million. GAAP net income for the nine-months was $654 million, or $2.89 per share. Excluding $49 million of non-recurring charges for acquired in-process research and development and $60 million of non-recurring tax charges in the first quarter, non-GAAP net income for the current nine-month period was $763 million, or $3.38 per share. These current-period non-GAAP earnings reflect an approximately 117 percent increase over the prior-year nine-month net income and earnings per share amounts of $352 million and $1.56, respectively. There were no non-recurring items in the prior-year nine-month period and therefore there is no comparable non-GAAP measure for the prior year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jul. 24, 2008  Demonstrating strong year-over-year performance, Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported financial results for its fiscal year 2008 and fourth quarter ended June 27, 2008.
     The company posted revenue of $8.1 billion and operating income of $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2008. Net income was $867 million, or $3.84 per share, compared to $564 million, or $2.50 per share for the prior year. The 2008 net income amount included net charges of $75 million for taxes related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries and $49 million for acquired in-process research and development. The 2007 net income amount included an income tax benefit of $126 million related to adjustments to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     These fiscal-year results represented increases in revenue of 48 percent, compared with the prior year's $5.5 billion, and unit growth of 38 percent, from 96.5 million in 2007 to
 
WD Announces Q4 Revenue of $2.0 Billion and Net Income of 94 Cents Per Share Page 2
133.3 million in 2008. The company grew its hard drive revenue contribution from non-desktop PC markets to 56 percent from 43 percent in the prior year.
     For the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $2.0 billion on shipments of approximately 35.2 million units, with operating income of $241 million and net income of $213 million, or $0.94 per share. The fourth quarter net income amount includes a $15 million incremental tax charge related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries.
     The June quarter results also represented strong year-over-year performance, including growth in revenue and unit shipments of 46 percent and 41 percent, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion, unit shipments of 24.9 million, operating income of $79 million and net income of $212 million, or $0.94 per share. Net income in the year-ago period included a $126 million tax benefit reflecting a favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance of the company's deferred tax assets.
     Sixty-three percent of Q4 revenue was derived from non-desktop sources, while 37 percent came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 46 percent non-desktop sources versus 54 percent desktop PC revenue.
     The company shipped 11.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 4.1 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market in the fourth quarter, sequential quarterly increases of 15 percent and 32 percent, respectively, and year-over-year increases of 208 percent and 52 percent, respectively. Branded product revenue of $386 million for the quarter increased 17 percent sequentially and 68 percent year-over-year. The company also continued to grow its shipments

of enterprise-class Serial ATA drives and hard drives featuring its unique GreenPower technology into the desktop, enterprise and consumer electronics markets.
     The company generated $318 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, ending with total cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion.
     "Fiscal 2008 was an outstanding year for WD, capped off with the strong fourth-quarter financial performance," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer.

Customer satisfaction with WD's broad product line, high quality and reliability, service excellence and overall value proposition continues to drive our profitable growth."
     Coyne also noted that the company's integration of the Komag acquisitionannounced just over one year ago and closed in September, 2007was complete and that its new media operation was already generating solid technology and cost contributions to the overall business.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On August 7, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning June 28, 2008 and ending December 26, 2008. Under the ICP, the Company's executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Company's achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning June 28, 2008 and ending December 26, 2008, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%.
For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executive's semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 125% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Company's performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Company's overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive's individual and business group's performance.
In addition, on August 7, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in the annual base salary for Timothy M. Leyden, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, from $450,000 to $550,000, effective August 11, 2008.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At an investment conference on September 4, 2008 and in meetings this week with investors, executives of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") are expected to discuss the following:  Thus far in the September quarter overall demand is consistent with seasonal patterns established over the last several years.  Regionally, demand in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America is offsetting some industry demand softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.  Consumer desktop demand is at the low end of expectations while notebook, commercial desktop, DVR and Enterprise SATA drive demand is tracking to expectations.  The Companys branded products business is reflecting continued strong demand at the retail level for the Companys industry-leading external storage products.  Industry and Company inventories are in line with seasonal demand patterns.  As anticipated in the Companys guidance on Ju ly 24, 2008 pricing thus far in the quarter has been competitive.  Historically the month of September represents a significant share of the industrys total business in the quarter. Actual industry demand and the Companys performance in September will therefore determine the final outcome of the quarter.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning: hard drive industry demand in the September quarter; hard drive industry demand in various geographical regions and various hard drive markets; demand for and industry leadership of the Companys external storage products; hard drive industry and Company inventory levels; pricing in the September quarter; and the significance of the month of September on the quarters results. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; actions by competitors; unexpected advances in competing technologies; uncertainties related to development and introduction of products based on new technologies and expansion into new hard drive markets; business conditions and growth in the various hard drive markets; pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices; changes in the availability and cost of commodity materials and specialized product components that the Company does not make internally; and other risks and uncertainties listed in WDs recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2008, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On December 14, 2008, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") committed to a business restructuring plan intended to realign its cost structure with a softer demand environment.
The restructuring plan includes the following actions by the Company:
These actions, which the Company expects to complete by the end of March 2009, are expected to result in total charges of approximately $150 million which will be incurred across the December and March quarters. These charges will consist of asset impairment charges of approximately $90 million, employee termination costs of approximately $35 million and other exit costs of approximately $25 million. Approximately $60 million of these charges will be cash expenditures. The savings generated are expected to amount to approximately $150 million annually.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
The Company expects to incur non-cash impairment charges of approximately $90 million in connection with the restructuring activities described in Item 2.05 of this Current Report, primarily for the closure of one of the Company's two hard drive manufacturing facilities in Navanakorn, Thailand and the closure or disposal of its media substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia. The information contained in Item 2.05 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) In connection with the restructuring activities described in Item 2.05 of this Current Report, on December 14, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved management-recommended decreases in the annual base salaries of its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and each of the other current executive officers of the Company who were named in the Summary Compensation Table in the Company's Proxy Statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Named Executive Officers"). Accordingly, effective January 12, 2009, the annual base salaries of the Named Executive Officers are as follows:
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In connection with the restructuring activities described in Item 2.05 of this Current Report, on December 14, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a 15% decrease in the annual retainers and committee fees payable to each of the
Table of Contents
Company's non-employee directors for calendar year 2009. The annual retainer and committee fees payable to each of the Company's non-employee directors for calendar year 2008, prior to this decrease, is set forth in the Western Digital Corporation Summary of Compensation Arrangements for Named Executive Officers and Directors, filed as Exhibit 10.7 to the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2008.
On December 17, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing that demand for hard drives in the December quarter is significantly below the expectations outlined in the Company's original revenue guidance range of $2.025 billion to $2.150 billion, issued on October 23, 2008. Industry pricing is also significantly more competitive than forecasted. WD now expects revenue for the December quarter to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, with a consequent reduction in operating results. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Demand for Branded Products and Consumer Electronics (PVR/DVR) has been the most resilient but is still somewhat below the Company's previous expectations entering the December quarter. Original Equipment Manufacturer and distribution demand in the Desktop, Notebook and Enterprise-SATA hard drive markets are significantly below the Company's expectations. The reduced demand patterns manifested themselves in late October 2008 and became more pronounced throughout November 2008.
Demand has been below expectations in all geographies. The markets most impacted are Russia, Korea and Latin America where a combination of the inability of customers to access credit and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the local currencies led customers to constrain order visibility and reduce order lot sizes in order to decrease inventory and conserve cash.
In addition to the slowing demand, the tight credit markets worldwide have led customers in all channels to reduce inventories. After taking some time to discern the declining demand pattern, the industry has acted throughout the quarter and is continuing to act to reduce excess capacity through temporary plant shutdowns and other actions which should lead to industry inventories at the end of the quarter being roughly in line with the reduced demand profile assuming typical seasonal demand patterns.
As described in Item 2.05 of this Current Report and in the press release, the Company is taking longer-term action to resize operational expenses and manufacturing resources to be more in line with the reduced demand run-rates which are expected to last well into calendar 2009. The intent of these resizing actions is to reduce the Company's expenses and "break-even" point to a level that allows the Company to be profitable and cash positive at a $1.5 billion revenue run-rate, assuming stable segment mix and supply/demand equilibrium.
As is typical, the demand and pricing environment during the remainder of the month of December 2008 will be critical in determining the Company's operating results for its second fiscal quarter of 2009.

LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Dec. 17, 2008  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC) today announced a series of actions to realign its cost structure with a softer demand environment and revised its revenue outlook for its second fiscal quarter ending December 26, 2008. Demand for hard drives in the December quarter is significantly below the expectations outlined in the company's original revenue guidance range of $2.025 billion to $2.150 billion, issued on October 23.

WD now expects revenue for the December quarter to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, with a consequent reduction in operating results.
     The company has taken action throughout the quarter to adjust supply to industry demand and is taking further action to align inventories with anticipated short-term demand by temporarily halting the majority of its manufacturing operations from December 20 through January 1, 2009, inclusive.

     "In the current macro economic climate, we expect demand weakness to last well into the middle of the 2009 calendar year," said president and chief executive officer John Coyne. "Consequently, we are taking additional steps to immediately reduce production capacity and operating expenses on a longer-term basis across our entire business as we approach the seasonally weaker second half of our fiscal year."
     Specifically, these additional actions include:
     These actions, which the company anticipates completing by the end of March 2009, are expected to result in total charges of approximately $150 million which will be incurred across the December and March quarters. These charges will consist of asset impairment charges of approximately $90 million, employee termination costs of approximately

$35 million and other exit costs of approximately $25 million. Approximately $60 million of these charges will be cash expenditures. The savings generated are expected to amount to approximately $150 million annually.
     Coyne said: "We are taking these actions in order to strengthen our financial position and enhance the ability of our business to withstand an extended period of depressed demand while continuing to invest in the technologies, products and processes required to assure the continued success of our business."
     As is typical, the demand and pricing environment during the remainder of the month of December will be critical in determining the company's operating results for its second fiscal quarter of 2009.
     The company intends to file a Form 8-K with the SEC today containing additional information.

We are focused on maintaining our leadership in technology deployment, ease-of-use features, and availability of the right products for our diversified customer base. We remain enthused about our long-term prospects as a full-line storage supplier in addressing the demands of both the commercial and consumer markets as the digitization of content continues to grow."

For example, the non-GAAP measures for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 3, 2009 exclude in-process research and development charges related to Western Digital's acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc., restructuring charges, and related tax benefits and favorable settlements, associated with Western Digital's restructuring plan announced on December 17, 2008, and a gain on the sale of assets from Western Digital's media substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia. The non-GAAP measures for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008 exclude taxes related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries and in-process research and development charges related to Western Digital's acquisition of Komag, Inc. Because management believes these gains and losses may not be indicative of ongoing operations, management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release and during the conference call are useful to investors as an alternative method for measuring Western Digital's operating performance and comparing it against prior periods' performance.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

(e) On August 20, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning July 4, 2009 and ending January 1, 2010. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning July 4, 2009 and ending January 1, 2010, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive 019;s individual and business groups performance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Oct. 22, 2009  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported record revenue of $2.2 billion, record hard drive shipments of 44.1 million units and net income of $288 million, or $1.25 per share, for its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 2, 2009. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $2.1 billion, unit shipments of 39.4 million, and net income of $211 million.
     The company generated $434 million in cash from operations during the first quarter, ending with total cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion.
     "For the second consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was stronger than expected as the positive industry conditions that materialized in the June quarter continued throughout the September quarter," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer. "We believe this demand is being driven primarily by consumers as a result of the growing social media phenomenon. This is creating demand in mobile and desktop PCs, branded products and enterprise storage. Hard drive inventories remain at historically low levels, reflecting industry discipline in managing supply and demand.

     "In the September quarter, we leveraged our organization-wide agility to respond to unexpectedly robust demand and again generated strong financial results. As we enter the December quarter, demand remains strong and our product line-up, availability and cost profile position us to benefit from continuing growth opportunities."
     Coyne noted that WD continues to realize tangible benefits from its investments in technology, products, processes and capacity over the last several years, enabled by the strongest balance sheet in the industry:

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
(e) The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") previously adopted an amendment and restatement of the Western Digital Corporation Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Restated Plan"), subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. Among other things, the Restated Plan reflects amendments to (i) increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for award grants under the Restated Plan by 14,500,000 shares; (ii) extend the Company's authority to grant awards under the Restated Plan intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the Company's 2014 annual meeting of stockholders and (iii) to approve the performance criteria listed in Section 5.2.2 of the Restated Plan for use in connection with such performance-based awards. According to the results from the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on November 11, 2009, the Company's stockholders have approved the Restated Plan.
     The following summary of the Restated Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by this reference.
     The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the Restated Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the Restated Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board. The administrator of the Restated Plan has broad authority under the plan to, among other things, select participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
     Persons eligible to receive awards under the Restated Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
     The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the Restated Plan equals the sum of: (1) 37,178,318 shares, plus (2) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted and outstanding as of November 13, 2009 under the Company's Employee Stock Option Plan, Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors or Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised.
     Shares issued in respect of any "full-value award" granted under the Restated Plan will be counted against the share limit described in the preceding paragraph as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award. For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of the Company's common stock were granted under the Restated Plan, 135 shares would be charged against the share limit with respect to that stock bonus award. For this purpose, a "full-value award" generally means any award granted under the plan other than a stock option or stock appreciation right.
     To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Restated Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any award under the Restated Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award, will not be available for subsequent awards under the Restated Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right, only the actual number of shares delivered with respect to the award will be counted against the share limits of the Restated Plan. To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted
 
against the share limits of the Restated Plan, as opposed to only counting the shares actually issued. Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the Restated Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the Restated Plan.
     The types of awards that may be granted under the Restated Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common stock or units of the Company's common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
     As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the Restated Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase price of awards, and the performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.
     As indicated above, the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company was held on November 11, 2009. Results of the voting at the meeting are set forth below.
     . The stockholders elected the following ten directors to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. The voting results were as follows:
Election of Directors
     . As described in more detail above, the stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan. The voting results were as follows:

     . The stockholders ratified the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending July 2, 2010. The voting results were as follows:

Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive&#x 2019;s individual and business groups performance.

(e) On February 9, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending July 1, 2011. Under the ICP, the Company's executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Company's achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending July 1, 2011, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%.
For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executive's semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Company's performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Company's overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive's individual and business group's performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Stock Purchase Agreement
On March 7, 2011, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Hitachi, Ltd. ("Hitachi"), Viviti Technologies Ltd., formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi ("HGST"), and Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("WDI").
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, WDI agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of HGST from Hitachi for an aggregate purchase price consisting of (i) cash consideration of $3.5 billion and (ii) 25 million shares (the "Company Stock") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Transaction"). The cash portion of the purchase price is subject to adjustment for changes in the working capital of HGST, outstanding debt of HGST and its subsidiaries as of the date of the Closing (as defined below) and certain other payments and expenses.
The Transaction, which is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2011 (the "Closing"), is subject to several closing conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approvals or the expiration of applicable waiting periods in certain jurisdictions, the absence of certain government restraints, the absence of any change or event that would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect with respect to HGST or the Company, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the execution and delivery of related Transaction documents, which are described below.
The Purchase Agreement provides that any vested stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") of HGST that are outstanding at the Closing (including any stock options or SARs that become vested in connection with the Transaction) will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Closing Payment over the exercise or base price per share of the option or SAR, as applicable. Similarly, any vested restricted stock units ("RSUs") of HGST that are outstanding at the Closing will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Per Share Closing Payment. Unvested stock options, SARs and RSUs of HGST that are outstanding at the Closing will be assumed by the Company and converted into equivalent option, SAR or RSU awards, as applicable, with respect to shares of the Company's common stock using an equity award exchange ratio equal to the Per Share Closing Payment divided by an amount equal to the average of the last reported sale prices for a single share of the Company's common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the third trading day prior to the date of the Closing. The "Per Share Closing Payment" will be an amount equal to the quotient of (i) the purchase price, as adjusted, increased by (A) the aggregate exercise or base price of the vested options and SARs, plus (B) the aggregate exercise or base price of the unvested options and SARs held by the continuing employees, and (ii) the fully diluted number of shares of HGST's capital.

The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for the parties thereto, including the right of the parties to terminate the Purchase Agreement if the Transaction has not closed by March 7, 2012. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated by any party because the Transaction has not closed by March 7, 2012, and if, as of the time of such termination certain regulatory and antitrust closing conditions have not been satisfied due to the failure to receive any required antitrust or competition consent, approval or clearance or any action by any certain governmental entities to prevent the Transaction for antitrust or competition reasons, then the Company will, concurrently with such termination, pay Hitachi a fee of $250,000,000 in cash.
Concurrently, and in connection with entering into the Purchase Agreement, the Company, Western Digital Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("WDT"), and WDI entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") with Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, pursuant to which, subject to the conditions set forth therein, Bank of America, N.A. committed to provide to WDI and WDT new senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Credit Facilities") up to $2,500,000,000, consisting of a $500,000,000 revolving credit facility and $2,000,000,000 in term loan facilities. The Senior Credit Facilities are contemplated to be used to finance a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Transaction, to refinance WDT's existing credit facilities and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transaction and the Senior Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility is contemplated to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The commitments of the lending parties under the Commitment Letter are subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, the consummation of the Transaction, the absence of a material adverse event with respect to HGST, the Company or WDI and the accuracy of specified corporate representations of HGST, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company.
The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the definitive documentation to be negotiated and executed in connection therewith, which will be filed with the Company's first periodic report that is due after the definitive documentation is fully executed.

Commencing upon the Closing, Hitachi and its controlled affiliates will be subject to customary "standstill" restrictions limiting or prohibiting, among other things, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of additional securities of the Company, seeking or proposing a change of control transaction, soliciting proxies or forming a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group, as those terms are used within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a "13D Group"), with respect to the equity securities of the Company. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, the standstill period runs until the earlier to occur of (i) a change of control of the Company or (ii) 90 days after the Hitachi Board Nomination Right terminates (as described in last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph).
In addition, for a period of one year following the Closing, subject to limited exceptions, Hitachi will be prohibited from, directly or indirectly, selling or otherwise transferring the shares of Company Stock that it receives in the Transaction.

Pursuant to the employment agreements, Messrs.

Pursuant to the employment agreements, each executive will be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards in accordance with the Company's guidelines applicable to the executive's position. The executives' long-term incentive awards will typically be granted as part of the Company's normal annual grant cycle, however, incentive awards for the Company's 2012 fiscal year are expected to be granted shortly after the Closing if the Closing occurs before the annual grant cycle (and as a new employee of the Company, Mr. Milligan is expected to receive, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board, a fiscal 2012 long-term incentive award having a grant date value of no less than $4,000,000).

Coyne, Milligan and Leyden will be $4,000,000, $2,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively. Each executive's actual number of stock units that may become earned and payable may range from 0% to 200% of his target number of units, with the number of units becoming earned and payable to be based on the Company's achievement of performance milestones that will be determined by the Company's Compensation Committee following the Closing. Each executive's integration bonus opportunity will become earned and payable over the two-year period following the date of the Closing, and may also become payable in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment under the Company's severance plans described below.
Pursuant to the employment agreements, Messrs. Coyne, Milligan and Leyden will each be entitled to participate in the Company's Executive Severance Plan and Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan, as each plan may be amended from time to time. Each executive will participate in these plans at the "Tier 1" level.
Pursuant to the employment agreements, Messrs. Coyne, Milligan and Leyden will each be subject to the Company's employee inventions and confidentiality agreement. Each executive has also agreed that he will not influence any customer, supplier or distributor of the Company during the term of the agreement and for 24 months thereafter.

"In the June quarter, we were able to meet stronger than anticipated demand, especially from our OEM customers," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer. "We believe the stronger demand was driven by increased use of sea freight in advance of the second half of the calendar year as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake.
"In a challenging HDD market environment in fiscal 2011, the industry saw unit volume growth of four percent while WD achieved growth of six percent as customers demonstrated a continued preference for the WD value proposition.
"We remain focused on completing our strategic acquisition of Hitachi GST. We are continuing to engage in the approval process with all the appropriate regulatory agencies and thus far we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey. We continue to work closely with the remaining agencies which are reviewing our transaction. As previously announced, we now expect that the transaction will close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2011, and our integration planning activities continue on schedule."

(e) On August 10, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") approved an increase in the base salary of Wolfgang U. Nickl, the Companys Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, from $350,000 to $400,000. On August 11, 2011, the Compensation Committee established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning July 2, 2011 and ending December 30, 2011. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning July 2, 2011 and ending December 30, 2011, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executives individual and business groups performance.

On September 14, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") approved new forms of award agreement under the Companys 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") applicable to "officers" of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The foregoing summary of the new forms of award agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the new forms, which the Company anticipates filing as Exhibits to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2011. On September 15, 2011, Peter D. Behrendt advised the Board of Directors that, consistent with the Companys retirement policy for directors, he intends to retire from the Board of Directors and not seek re-election when his term expires at the Companys upcoming 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Behrendt, age 72, has served on the Companys Board of Directors since 1994.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
IRVINE, Calif.Oct. 12, 2011Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today announced that production of hard drives in its facilities close to Bangkok, Thailand, will be constrained in the current quarter due to the severe flooding in Thailand. The flooding is causing problems with the region's infrastructure, including transportation and utilities, and has resulted in the inundation of some supplier facilities and employee homes. The company is gratified to report that its approximately 37,000 Thailand-based employees are deemed safe at this time.
The company is working with its suppliers to maximize throughput and availability of parts in order to best meet the needs of its customers.
In the quarter ending July 1, 2011, WD shipped approximately 54 million hard drives from its facilities in Thailand and Malaysia, with approximately 60 percent coming from its Thailand sites. The company's Thailand operations source much of its supply of components from local suppliers.
While WD's facilities in Thailand are operational, production has been suspended on a temporary basis to protect its employees and its facilities and equipment against water ingress. The company indicated that conditions associated with the continued flooding are evolving quickly and the extent of the impact on its operations in Thailand cannot yet be fully determined. The company will provide further updates on the situation, including on its investment community conference call on Wednesday, October 19, 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
IRVINE, Calif.Oct. 17, 2011Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today announced that it has extended the suspension of its operations in Thailand. Over the weekend, rising water penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundating the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerging some equipment. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park flood defenses were breached on Monday morning local time and water has begun to flow into the park threatening the company's facilities there. All WD employees in Thailand remain safe.
The company's other facilities in Malaysia, Singapore and the U.S. are fully operational. The company now expects that the flooding of its Thailand facilities, combined with flood damage to the company's supply chain in Thailand, will have significant impact on the company's overall operations and its ability to meet customer demand for its products in the December quarter. The company will provide further updates on the situation on its investment community conference call on Wednesday, October 19, 2011.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 19, 2011, Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital") announced financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of Western Digital's Investor Information Summary for the first quarter ended September 30, 2011 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In Western Digital's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, Western Digital reports certain financial information, including net income and earnings per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011. These non-GAAP measures exclude expenses related to Western Digital's proposed acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and unrelated litigation accruals. Because management believes these expenses may not be indicative of ongoing operations, management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors as an alternative method for measuring Western Digital's operating performance and comparing it against prior periods' performance.

Top of the Form
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Top of the Form

As I begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning: industry demand in the December quarter and the industry's ability to meet that demand; the impact of the flooding in Thailand on the industry and our business in the December quarter and beyond, including our HDD capacity, our planned operations recovery efforts and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with these efforts, and our ability to complete these recovery efforts; the expected completion and the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST; growth opportunities in the industry; our product offerings in the near-line enterprise market; OEM inventory levels; and our financial results expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count, and loss per share. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on Aug. 12, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.
In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.westerndigital.com. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with and following the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST and unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand. Because these acquisition-related and unusual expense items are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.
As a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. We ask that analysts limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
Thank you, Bob.
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO Tim Leyden and CFO Wolfgang Nickl.
As you can imagine, the WD team has been consumed recently in dealing with the relentless flooding in Thailand and its significant impact on our employees, their families, and our suppliers' as well as on the business infrastructure in the region. We are grateful that the WD employees in Thailand are safe at this time although many of their lives and homes have been disrupted and damaged.
This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times.
Having addressed the safety of our people and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi quarter challenge.
We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels. Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers.
In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we are dealing with the operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook.
Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just above the high end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is a record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industrydemonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universeeven in an environment of broad based low growth and global economic uncertainty.
While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was nevertheless muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which has time-shifted typical seasonal linearity.
WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe the acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year.
th
Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market.
While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I am highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team, with its strong execution skills, to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiently. This is a short term challenge, in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD.
Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I want to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company leader could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team.
Thank you John.
Firstly, I will cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the Thailand flooding on our business.
WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4 percent sequentially and 14.0 percent from the year-ago period, as we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses, where our value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix, pass through to customers of a portion of our rare earth material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12.4 percent year-on-year. Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1 percent.
Price declines for the quarter were at a minimal level and were less than the seasonal norm, product mix was favorable, effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance.
Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million as we invested funds in working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter.
Now, turning to market segment performance, in the compute space, industry shipments increased to 119 million from 118 million in the June quarter, and were up from 115 million in the year-ago quarter.  WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter, and we grew market share by approximately 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger although this seasonal uplift was more muted than we have seen historically in a typical fiscal Q1.
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 to 6.8 million units, and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market continues to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market  at 7.9 million units  was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined Enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. We remain on plan to bring our third generation 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year.
HDD manufacturers' shipments in the branded product segment came in at 14.4 million units, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter, as the sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was strong at 24.1 percent. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters. WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake.
In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflects strong customer preference for WD's appealing product line-up.
The remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives.
Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run-rate levels in each segment.
Now turning to the December quarter, we believe that the unconstrained HDD market TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply constrained due to the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers and factories in various industrial estates in the flooded and flood threatened areas.
I will now address the specific impact of the flooding on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities from the beginning of last week, in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe, and we moved much of the equipment which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors.
Despite the heroic efforts of our team, over the past weekend rising water which had first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park flood defenses were breached on Monday morning local time and water began to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night.
The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly, test and slider facilities where a substantial majority of our slider fabrication capacity resides. In parallel with the internal slider shortages resulting from the above disruption, we are also experiencing other shortages on component parts from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods, or have been affected by protective plant shutdowns. We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis, but in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need the water level to stabilize, after which point it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We are assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and either extract and transfer the equipment to clean-rooms in other locations or prepare it for operation on-site. As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters.
We are working with our suppliers to effect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations.
We are proceeding with all possible haste and ingenuity to address the situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facility's throughput.
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
Thank you, Tim.
As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter.
For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12 percent from the prior year and the June quarter.
Hard drive average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter, and up $2 from the June quarter.
Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15 percent from the year-ago quarter due to continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded products revenue was up 28 percent from the June quarter.
There were no customers that comprised 10 percent or more of our total revenue.
Demand in Asia remained strong at 59 percent of revenue, up from 54 percent in the prior year and down slightly from 60 percent in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22 percent of revenue, down slightly from 23 percent in the prior year, but up from the 20 percent reported in the June quarter. Americas at 19 percent of revenue, was down from both last year's 23 percent and June's 20 percent.
OEM sales represented 53 percent of revenue, up from 50 percent in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June's 55 percent. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18 percent, flat to the prior year, but seasonally up from June's 16 percent.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1 percent, up from 18.2 percent in the year-ago quarter and 19.5 percent in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segment and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly as higher costs of rare earth materials were not fully offset by savings in other areas. As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments, before passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarters. While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the midpoint of our target business model.
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million in the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively. The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue in the September quarter, versus $226 million, or 9.4 percent of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $265 million, or 11.0 percent of revenue, in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development.
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million.
Tax expense for the September quarter was $19 million, or 7.4 percent of pre-tax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Komag, the magnetic media company we acquired in September of 2007.
Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million, or $1.01 per share, as compared to $197 million, or $0.84 per share, for the year-ago quarter and $158 million, or $0.67 per share, in the June quarter. The September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees, and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million, or $1.10 per share, as compared to $197 million, or $0.84 per share, in the year-ago quarter and $193 million, or $0.81 per share, in the June quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 72 days of payables. We generated $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increases we are experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected in an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million.
Capital expenditures for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million.
We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $263 million.
We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately $3.0 billion of our ending cash balance was off-shore.
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter.
From a market perspective:
With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter:
With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows. This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just referred to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation and, as we have said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve.
We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 and 26 million units.
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.250 billion.
R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges.
We expect tax expense of approximately $10 million.
We anticipate our share count to be approximately 234 million.
Accordingly, we estimate a non-GAAP loss per share of between $1.10 and $1.50 for the December quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand.
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
: Thank you all very much for tuning into the call today. As you can imagine, we will be highly focused in the weeks and months ahead to ensure the continued well being of our employees and to complete our business recovery from this significant but temporary setback, and we will keep you informed of our progress. Thank you.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
IRVINE, Calif.  Dec. 1, 2011  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC) today is updating its financial outlook for the December quarter and the progress to date of its operations recovery effort in Thailand. The company is also providing its view of the industry conditions for the December 2011 quarter and beyond.
Company Fiscal Q2 Outlook
:
For the December quarter, the company now expects revenue of at least $1.8 billion and gross margins above the high end of its business model range of 18 percent to 23 percent, and operating expenses of approximately $265 million, exclusive of unusual charges related to the floods, acquisition-related expenses and litigation. Unusual charges related to the floods are expected to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million for the December quarter, exclusive of any insurance recovery. The company expects to file a property damage claim of at least $50 million and an additional claim for business interruption during the December quarter. The accounting treatment of these claims is dependent on their status as of the end of the quarter. The company expects acquisition related charges in the December quarter of approximately $15 million.
The company will be vigorously contesting the arbitration decision announced November 21, 2011, in the legal matter with Seagate and has not yet determined the accounting treatment associated with this matter.
The company expects to maintain its net cash position flat with prior quarter end.
Thailand Flood Recovery Effort:
"The passion, perseverance, ingenuity and execution exhibited by the WD team has been extraordinary and enabled us to make substantial progress in partially restoring our operations in Thailand, well in advance of our earliest expectations when the floods hit," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer of WD. "Much work remains to be done but we couldn't be more pleased with the effort and results thus far, including tremendous support from our supply partners and strategic customers."
Specifically, the company indicated it:
Industry Conditions
:
The company believes that hard drive industry shipments in the December quarter will be limited to approximately 120 million units due to production and supply constraints related to the historic flooding in Thailand. This includes units that were in inventory at the beginning of the quarter. The company believes that demand for the December quarter is in the range of 170 million to 180 million units. The company believes that significant industry supply constraints will continue in the March quarter and beyond.
HGST Acquisition Status Update:
In connection with its planned acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the company is working to satisfy the remedy provision included in the European Commission's recent conditional approval of the transaction and to obtain approvals from the remaining regulatory authorities. Subject to completing these actions, the company is now expecting to close the transaction by March 2012.
The company is not hosting a conference call to discuss today's updates.

A copy of Western Digital's Investor Information Summary for the second quarter ended December 30, 2011 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In Western Digital's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, Western Digital reports certain financial information, including net income and earnings per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2011. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges and expenses related to the Thailand flooding and Western Digital's planned acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies.

Operations Update
The company also announced it has made significant additional progress to restore its manufacturing capacity following the recent flooding in Thailand. It has continued to ramp HDD production in Thailand and yesterday resumed slider production which had been suspended since October 10. The company now believes its manufacturing capacity will be back to pre-flood capabilities in the quarter ending September 2012.
"We have made substantial progress in restoring WD's manufacturing capabilities in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand, and this is reflected in our second quarter financial results and in the resumption of our operations there," said John Coyne, president and chief executive officer. "While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress thus far is significantly ahead of our original expectations and is a tribute to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. We are grateful to all involved in this extraordinary effort."
HGST Acquisition
The company's plan to complete the acquisition of HGST is on track to close by March 2012. The company continues to work on obtaining the regulatory approval of the transaction from the remaining government agencies.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On January 23, 2012, a sole arbitrator in a confidential arbitration action in Minnesota awarded pre-award interest to Seagate Technology, LLC in the amount of $105.4 million in connection with the previously announced arbitration award of $525 million rendered against Western Digital Corporation (the "Company) on November 18, 2011. The Company has filed a petition in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated. The Company does not believe the arbitration award will affect the Companys ability to conduct its operations, to complete the recovery of its Thailand operations or, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals, to consummate the planned acquisition of Viviti Technologies Ltd. (formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd.) ("Hitachi GST"). In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning the Companys ability to conduct its operations, complete the recovery of its Thailand operations and, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals, consummate its planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including: higher than anticipated recovery costs; unfavorable changes in the results of the Companys operations which adversely impact its ability to comply with financial covenants in its existing and future debt agreements; delays in or failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals with respect to the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST; failure to consummate or delay in consummating the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST for other reasons; the possibility that the expected benefits of the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST may not materialize as expected; failure to successfully integrate the products, R&D capabilities, infrastructure and employees of the Company and Hitachi GST; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including the Companys recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 28, 2011 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, to which your attention is directed.

(e) On February 17, 2012, the Compensation Committee established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning December 31, 2011 and ending June 29, 2012. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning December 31, 2011 and ending June 29, 2012, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executives individual and business groups performance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
IRVINE, Calif.Feb. 28, 2012Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported that it has reached an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to divest certain assets to address the requirements of regulatory agencies that have conditionally approved or are continuing to review the company's planned acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). The asset package covered by the agreement will enable Toshiba to manufacture and sell 3.5-inch hard drives for the desktop and consumer electronics markets and will enhance its ability to manufacture and sell 3.5-inch hard drives for near-line (business critical) applications. The divestiture transaction is subject to review by regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions.
WD also reported that it has agreed, subject to completion of the divestiture transaction, to purchase Toshiba Storage Device (Thailand) Company Limited (TSDT).

Subject to completion of the transaction, WD plans to integrate these facilities and employees into its Thailand operations. The financial terms of the two agreements were not disclosed.
The closing of the transactions with Toshiba is conditioned on WD's closing of its planned acquisition of HGST, which remains subject to several closing conditions, including the receipt of certain remaining antitrust approvals. Subject to obtaining these approvals, the company is targeting the transactions with Toshiba to close in March 2012.

Hitachi, Ltd. Cautionary Statement
Certain statements found in this document may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such "forward-looking statements" reflect management's current views with respect to certain future events and financial performance and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "forecast," "intend," "plan," "project" and similar expressions which indicate future events and trends may identify "forward-looking statements." Such statements are based on currently available information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the "forward-looking statements" and from historical trends. Certain "forward-looking statements" are based upon current assumptions of future events which may not prove to be accurate. Undue reliance should not be placed on "forward-looking statements," as such statements speak only as of the date of this document.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any "forward-looking statement" and from historical trends include, but are not limited to:
 -  economic conditions, including consumer spending and plant and equipment investment in
Hitachi's major markets, particularly Japan, Asia, the United States and Europe, as well as levels of demand in the major industrial sectors Hitachi serves, including, without limitation, the information, electronics, automotive, construction and financial sectors;
 -  exchange rate fluctuations of the yen against other currencies in which Hitachi makes
significant sales or in which Hitachi's assets and liabilities are denominated, particularly against the U.S. dollar and the euro;
 -  uncertainty as to Hitachi's ability to access, or access on favorable terms, liquidity or long-
term financing;
 -  uncertainty as to general market price levels for equity securities in Japan, declines in which
may require Hitachi to write down equity securities that it holds;
 -  the potential for significant losses on Hitachi's investments in equity method affiliates;
 -  increased commoditization of information technology products and digital media-related
products and intensifying price competition for such products, particularly in the Components & Devices and the Digital Media & Consumer Products segments;
new technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis and to achieve market acceptance for
such products;
 -  rapid technological innovation;
 -  the possibility of cost fluctuations during the lifetime of, or cancellation of, long-term
contracts for which Hitachi uses the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue from sales;
materials, such as copper, steel, aluminum, synthetic resins, rare metals and rare-earth minerals, or shortages of materials, parts and components;
 -  fluctuations in product demand and industry capacity;
 -  uncertainty as to Hitachi's ability to implement measures to reduce the potential negative
impact of fluctuations in product demand, exchange rates and/or price of raw materials or shortages of materials, parts and components;
 -  uncertainty as to Hitachi's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of its strategy to
strengthen its Social Innovation Business;
 -  uncertainty as to the success of restructuring efforts to improve management efficiency by
divesting or otherwise exiting underperforming businesses and to strengthen competitiveness and other cost reduction measures;
 -  general socioeconomic and political conditions and the regulatory and trade environment of
countries where Hitachi conducts business, particularly Japan, Asia, the United States and Europe, including, without limitation, direct or indirect restrictions by other nations on imports and differences in commercial and business customs including, without limitation, contract terms and conditions and labor relations;
may not control, with other corporations in the design and development of certain key products;
 -  uncertainty as to Hitachi's access to, or ability to protect, certain intellectual property rights,
particularly those related to electronics and data processing technologies;
 -  uncertainty as to the outcome of litigation, regulatory investigations and other legal
proceedings of which the Company, its subsidiaries or its equity method affiliates have become or may become parties;
 -  the possibility of incurring expenses resulting from any defects in products or services of
Hitachi;
 -  the possibility of disruption of Hitachi's operations in Japan by earthquakes, tsunamis or other
natural disasters, including the possibility of continuing adverse effects on Hitachi's operations as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011;
as Hitachi's ability to protect its confidential information or that of its customers;
 -  uncertainty as to the accuracy of key assumptions Hitachi uses to evaluate its significant
employee benefit-related costs; and
 -  uncertainty as to Hitachi's ability to attract and retain skilled personnel.
The factors listed above are not all-inclusive and are in addition to other factors contained in Hitachi's periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in other materials published by Hitachi.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Investor Rights Agreement
On March 8, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the "Investor Rights Agreement") with Hitachi Ltd. ("Hitachi") in connection with the closing (the "Closing") of the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of Viviti Technologies Ltd., formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Pte. Ltd. ("HGST"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi.
Pursuant to the Investors Rights Agreement, Hitachi will have the right, but not the obligation, to designate two individuals (together, the "Hitachi Designees") to serve as directors on the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company (the "Hitachi Board Nomination Right"). If Hitachi determines to designate the Hitachi Designees, Hitachi will notify the Company in writing of the names of the Hitachi Designees and, promptly following receipt by the Company of all documentation reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the appointment of the Hitachi Designees, the Company will increase the size of the Board by two and fill the resulting vacancies with the Hitachi Designees in accordance with the Company's bylaws. The Company thereafter will include Hitachi Designees in its slate of nominees for election to the Board at each annual or special meeting of stockholders following the Closing at which directors are to be elected, and recommend that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the election of Hitachi Designees, support Hitachi Designees for election in a manner no less favorable than how the Company supports its own nominees and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of the Hitachi Designees to the Board.
The Hitachi Board Nomination Right will terminate (i) with respect to one of the Hitachi Designees, at the end of the second full calendar year following the Closing Date, (ii) in the event that Hitachi ceases to beneficially own at least 50% of the shares of Company Stock (as defined in Item 2.01 below), (iii) if Hitachi has first sold at least 10% of the shares of Company Stock, in the event that Hitachi ceases to beneficially own at least 5% of the Company's total issued and outstanding common stock, (iv) upon Hitachi's breach of the standstill or transfer restriction obligations of the Investor Rights Agreement, which are described below, or (v) upon Hitachi's material breach of that certain Agreement Not to Compete entered into between the Company and Hitachi on the Closing Date.
Commencing upon the Closing, Hitachi and its controlled affiliates will be subject to "standstill" restrictions limiting or prohibiting, among other things, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of additional securities of the Company, seeking or proposing a change of control transaction, soliciting proxies from or forming a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (a "13D Group"), as those terms are used within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), with respect to the equity securities of the Company. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, the standstill period runs until the earlier of (i) a change of control of the Company or (ii) 90 days after the Hitachi Board Nomination Right terminates (as described in the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph).
For a period of one year following the Closing, Hitachi will be prohibited from, directly or indirectly, selling or otherwise transferring any of the shares of Company Stock, except with the prior written consent of the Company. In addition, during the term of the Investor Rights Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, Hitachi will be prohibited from, directly or indirectly, selling or otherwise transferring the shares of Company Stock to (i) certain competitors of the Company or affiliates of such competitors designated by the Company and (ii) members of a 13D Group.
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Hitachi also has certain registration rights with respect to the shares of Company Stock, including shelf, demand and piggyback registration rights.
Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement
The information contained in Item 2.01 below concerning an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, dated March 6, 2012, is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On the Closing Date, concurrent with entering into the Credit Facility (as defined in Item 2.03 below), the existing credit agreement, dated as of February 11, 2008, by and among Western Digital Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("WDT"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, terminated.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On the Closing Date, the Company, through Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("WDI"), completed the previously announced acquisition (the "Transaction") of all of the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of HGST pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 7, 2011, by and among the Company, WDI, Hitachi and HGST (as amended, the "Purchase Agreement"). The consideration paid for the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of HGST consisted of approximately $3.9 billion in cash and 25 million shares of the Company's common stock (the "Company Stock"), which had an aggregate value of approximately $947 million based on the closing trading price of the Company's common stock of $37.87 on March 7, 2012, the last trading day prior to the Closing. The parties negotiated and agreed to an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, dated March 6, 2012, to address contractual issues that arose leading up to the Closing. As part of the amendment, the Closing Date was set for March 8, 2012 and the cash consideration was increased by approximately $392 million to $3.9 billion through adjustments to provisions of the Purchase Agreement addressing working capital and certain pension obligations of HGST.
Of the cash portion of the purchase price, approximately $585 million was used to pay outstanding debt of HGST at Closing and certain other payments and expenses and approximately $197 million was used for cash payments made in connection with the cancellation of vested stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") of HGST as described in the following paragraph. In addition, the cash paid at Closing did not include approximately $207 million attributable to the value of the unvested stock options, SARs and RSUs of HGST that were outstanding at the Closing and were assumed by the Company as described in the following paragraph (such estimate is based on the aggregate difference between the Per Share Closing Payment (as defined below) and the exercise or base price per share of the unvested stock options, SARs and RSUs outstanding at the Closing). The payments made at Closing also gave effect to a working capital adjustment and are subject to certain post-Closing true-up provisions of the Purchase Agreement. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through borrowings under the Credit Facility (as defined in Item 2.03 below) and cash on hand.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, all vested stock options and SARs of HGST that were outstanding on the Closing Date (including any stock options or SARs that became vested in connection with the Transaction) were cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Closing Payment (as defined below) over the exercise or base price per share of the option or SAR, as applicable. Similarly, any vested RSUs of HGST that were outstanding at the Closing were cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Per Share Closing Payment. In addition, unvested stock options, SARs and RSUs of HGST that were outstanding at the Closing were assumed by the Company and converted into equivalent option, SAR or RSU awards, as applicable, with respect to shares of the Company's common stock using an equity award exchange ratio equal to the Per Share Closing Payment divided by an amount equal to the average of the last reported sale prices for a single share of the Company's common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the third trading day prior to the Closing Date. The "Per Share Closing Payment" is an amount equal to the quotient of (i) the purchase price, as adjusted, increased by the aggregate exercise or base price of the vested and unvested options and SARs, and (ii) the fully diluted number of shares in the capital of HGST (including shares subject to vested and unvested stock options, SARs and RSUs).
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On the Closing Date, and in connection with the Transaction, the Company, WDI and WDT entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the lenders party thereto (the "Credit Facility").
 
The Credit Facility provides for $2.8 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a $2.3 billion term loan facility and a $500 million revolving credit facility. The borrower under the term loan facility is WDI and the borrowers under the revolving credit facility are WDI and WDT (WDI and WDT are hereinafter referred to as the "Borrowers"). The revolving credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swing line loans. In addition, a Borrower may elect to expand the credit facilities by up to $500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments.
The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Facility are guarantied by the Company and the Company's material domestic subsidiaries, and the obligations of WDI under the Credit Facility are also guarantied by WDT, in each case, as further provided in the Credit Facility.
The $2.3 billion term loans and $500 million revolving loans were borrowed on the Closing Date and were used to finance a portion of the purchase price of the Transaction, to refinance the existing term loans of WDT, and to pay fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Credit Facility. Revolving loans may be used by the Borrowers from time to time for working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions).
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the applicable Borrower, either (a) a LIBOR rate, subject to certain exceptions, determined by the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (the "Eurodollar Rate") or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00% (the "Base Rate"), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 1.50% to 2.50% with respect to borrowings at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.50% to 1.50% with respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis.
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Facility, the Borrowers are required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder. The facility fee rate ranges from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum and is determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis. The Borrowers are also required to pay letter of credit fees (a) to the revolving credit facility lenders on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters of credit equal to an applicable margin in effect with respect to the Eurodollar Rate borrowings and (b) to the letter of credit issuer computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the face amount of the letter of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer's customary documentary and processing fees and charges.
Beginning on March 30, 2012, WDI is required under the term loan facility to make regularly scheduled payments of principal in quarterly installments equal to $57.5 million.
The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
In connection with the Closing of the Transaction, WDI delivered the Company Stock to Hitachi on the Closing Date. The issuance of the Company Stock by the Company to WDI and WDI's delivery of the Company Stock to Hitachi were made pursuant to the exemptions from registration provided by Sections 4(2) and 4(1), respectively, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

"The completion of this acquisition is a truly momentous event in the 42-year history of our company," said Coyne. "With ownership of two successful companies and the best talent available in the industry, we expect to accomplish great things as we build the new WD to be the world's leading storage solutions provider with the industry's deepest technology capability, broadest product portfolio and best-in-class execution. Similar to successful multi-brand models in other industries, the two subsidiaries will compete in the marketplace with separate brands and product lines while sharing common values of customer delight, value creation, consistent profitability and growth."

"We have acquired a strong presence in the traditional enterprise market, substantially increased our presence in the industry's fastest-growing segmentscloud and mobilityand improved our capability to address new market initiatives such as enterprise SSD, storage solutions for small business and low-profile HDDs and hybrid drives for Ultrabooks. As a result, WD is better positioned than ever for success."

A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of Western Digital's Investor Information Summary for the third quarter ended March 30, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In Western Digital's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, Western Digital reports certain financial information, including net income and earnings per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the third fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2012. These non-GAAP measures exclude expenses related to Western Digital's acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies; costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written-up to fair value and amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition; charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand net of recoveries; and tax benefits related to the aforementioned items. Because management believes these expenses and gains may not be indicative of ongoing operations, management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors as an alternative method for measuring Western Digital's operating performance and comparing it against prior periods' performance.

Exhibit 99.3
 
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Viviti Technologies Ltd.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viviti Technologies Ltd. as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Viviti Technologies Ltd. at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2010, Viviti Technologies Ltd. adopted the accounting guidance for the transfers of financial assets.

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Company Information
Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. ("Hitachi" or the "Parent") in the beginning of 2003 through the combination of the disk drive businesses of IBM and Hitachi. From the beginning of 2003 until November 2010, the company operated in a holding company structure under Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. In October 2010, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. ("Hitachi GST" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore, and in November 2010, Hitachi GST became the holding company. The change in domicile of the holding company did not have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In 2011, the name of the holding company was changed to Viviti Technologies Ltd. The Company is dependent upon financing provided by the Parent under various credit facilities. Note 4 provides additional information related to these credit facilities.

Stock Split and Exchange of Shares
In March 2010, Hitachi GST effected a 10,000-for-1 stock split of the Company's ordinary shares series B and a 1,000:1 stock split of the Company's preference shares series C. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this stock split. In addition, the Company authorized 23 million ordinary shares, series D.
In November 2010, in connection with the change in domicile to Singapore, the Company issued to Hitachi Class A and Class C preference shares and Class B ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, in a one-for-one exchange for the issued and outstanding preference shares Series A and Series C and ordinary shares Series B in the capital of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. held by Hitachi (see Note 6).
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and all variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").
The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for all but one of the Company's subsidiaries. When the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency, monetary accounts denominated in non-U.S. currencies, such as cash or payables to vendors, are remeasured to the U.S. Dollar and all gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. One foreign operation designates its local currency as its functional currency. The accounts of this operation are translated into U.S. Dollars and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
 
Noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the aggregate 20% ownership in the Company's consolidated majority-owned subsidiary, Shenzhen Hailiang Storage Products Company Limited in China.
Management Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company did not hold any cash equivalents for the periods presented.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectability. This reserve is established based upon historical trends, global macroeconomic conditions and an analysis of specific exposures.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. The Company records inventory write-downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances. Net realizable value is based upon an estimated average market value reduced by estimated completion and selling costs.
The Company routinely evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence by analyzing inventory on hand, historical sales levels and estimated future demand, and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective assets. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the equipment or the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or the lease term. Land is not subject to depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This annual test is performed in the Company's fourth quarter.
Testing goodwill for impairment requires a two-step approach. In step one, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. If step one of the analysis demonstrates that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, the Company will proceed to step two. In step two, the Company estimates the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities of the reporting unit using the income and market approaches. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the goodwill carrying value to its fair value. The Company did not record goodwill impairment for any of the periods presented, as in each period the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill.
 
 
Other Intangible Assets
Acquisition-related intangible assets, including technology, trade names and customer relationships, are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, ranging from two to seven years. The Company assesses intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company did not record an impairment of intangible assets for any of the periods presented.
Land Being Readied for Sale
The Company has land in San Jose, California, which was the former site of certain office and manufacturing facilities and was originally acquired as part of the acquisition of the disk drive business of IBM. The Company is evaluating under what circumstances to dispose of the land. Accordingly, the land is classified as a non-current asset. Costs to prepare the land for sale are capitalized to the extent that recovery of such costs is reasonably expected from the sale.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, including land being readied for sale, intangible assets with finite lives and property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The assets are considered to be impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition is less than their carrying values. The impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. In determining the fair value, the Company uses the income and market approaches. If the fair value of the asset is lower than the asset's carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to fair value. If useful lives of long-lived assets have decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life.
The Company incurred $53 million and $3 million of impairment charges for land being readied for sale in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment of long-lived assets in 2010.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue, including revenue from distribution customers, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Products are considered delivered when shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred, based upon the terms of shipment, from the Company or third party warehouse facilities.
The Company maintains various sales incentive programs aimed at increasing customer demand. These programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor's level of sales, order size and price protection adjustments. The Company's price protection program entitles distributors and resellers to limited price protection for inventories held by them at the time of published list price reductions. The Company also provides rebates based on volume of purchases or other agreed-upon rebate programs to distributors, resellers and OEMs. The Company estimates reductions to revenue for sales incentive programs and records such reductions when revenue is recorded. The Company also has programs under which it reimburses resellers and distributors for certain qualified marketing expenditures, which are recorded as a reduction to revenue when the related product revenue is recorded. Estimates related to these rebates and adjustments are based on various factors, including price reductions during the period reported, estimated future price erosion, customer orders, distributor sell-through and inventory levels, program participation, and customer claim submittals. These estimates include judgments relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals, and inventory supply and sell-through levels reported by the Company's distributors. The Company's estimates are impacted by its assessment of industry supply and demand conditions, including seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of products.
 
 
The Company generally does not grant product return rights.
Shipping and Handling
The Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of revenue.
Accrued Warranty
Warranty costs are accrued when revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of one to five years. The warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and estimated warranty fulfillment costs, which include the estimated cost and mix of providing customers with replacement drives, repaired drives, or customer compensatory claims for product quality issues. The Company uses a statistical warranty tracking model that considers historical trends to develop estimates of future warranty costs. The estimated future warranty costs are affected by warranty terms offered, the warranty period, shipment volumes, product failure rates and warranty fulfillment costs. Warranty estimates involve a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base the Company's warranty estimates. For new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists, warranty information from previous similar products is used to estimate the warranty accrual.
Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities
The Company recognizes a liability measured at fair value for one-time involuntary termination benefits at the communication date of the termination. If employees are required to render service until they are terminated and that service period extends beyond a defined minimum retention period, a liability is recognized ratably over the future service period. For any employee voluntary terminations, the Company recognizes a liability for related costs when the employee accepts the termination offer and the amount is reasonably estimable.
A liability for the costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company terminates the contract. A liability for any costs that continue to be incurred under a terminated contract without benefit to the Company is recognized and measured at its fair value.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company's share-based compensation plans include options to purchase ordinary shares, restricted share units, which entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share, and share appreciation rights, which entitle the holder to a cash payment equal to the appreciation in the Company's ordinary shares over a period of time.
Share-based compensation for options to purchase ordinary shares is estimated at the grant date based on fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Share-based compensation for restricted share units is estimated at the grant date based on fair value. The Company recognizes share-based compensation over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation for share appreciation rights is estimated based on fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The share-based compensation liability is remeasured at each reporting date based on the fair value of the award and the service period rendered.
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in various countries. The benefits are based on the employees' years of service and compensation. The plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government authorities. The Company also sponsors defined benefit health care plans for certain eligible retirees and employees. Net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the retirement benefits. The Company amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated average service life of the participants. The measurement date for the plans is December 31 of each year.
 
 
The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in the funded status recognized through accumulated other comprehensive loss in the year in which such changes occur.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange risk. Foreign currency derivatives are recorded at fair value using observable market data and reflected in prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities.
The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges. Instruments that do not meet the related criteria are classified as non-accounting (balance sheet) hedges. A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment, is referred to as a fair value hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge includes the assessment of the instrument's effectiveness in risk reduction, the matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the probability of occurrence of the underlying transaction. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. For derivative instruments that are designated as either fair value or balance sheet hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period incurred and are reported in other income (expense), net.
The Company hedges foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht, Singapore Dollar, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen and contracts entered into are typically designated as balance sheet hedges. The contracts generally have maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months. All forward exchange contracts are for risk management purposes only. The Company does not purchase currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes.
Concentration of Credit and Other Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash at banks, trade accounts receivables and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and maintains a provision for potential credit losses based on collectability of all accounts receivable, which limits credit risk on its accounts receivable. The Company has not experienced significant credit losses related to its accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to non-performance risk by counterparties on the currency forward exchange contracts used in hedging activities. The Company seeks to minimize risk by diversifying its hedging program across multiple financial institutions. These counterparties are large international financial institutions, and to date no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.
Certain of the raw materials and components used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials and components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain of such materials or components, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax base of the Company's assets and liabilities and for expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets, and adjusts the valuation allowance so that it records net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company concludes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.
 
 
The Company's policy is to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount at which realization is more-likely-than-not to occur. In making such determination, the Company considers all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, long-term deferred tax assets, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes.
Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's ("FASB") amendments to the accounting guidance for the transfers of financial assets, which eliminated the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. As a result of this amendment, many types of transferred financial assets that previously qualified for de-recognition from the balance sheet no longer qualify, including certain securitized accounts receivable. In particular, this amendment removed the undivided interest concept and introduced the concept of a participating interest as a unit of account. The amendment reiterates the requirement that in order for a transfer of accounts receivable to qualify as a sale, effective control must be transferred. If the accounts receivable transferred meet the definition of a participating interest, the transfer qualifies for sale accounting. Because the accounts receivable transferred under the Company's securitization arrangement did not meet the definition of a participating interest, the arrangement failed to meet the new requirements of a complete transfer of control, and could not continue to be treated as a sale. As a result of the adoption of these amendments, effective January 1, 2010, the Company began recording securitized accounts receivable in its consolidated financial statements and began recognizing the outstanding amount of senior undivided interests as borrowings.
Effective January 1, 2010, the Company also adopted the FASB's amendment to the accounting guidance for enterprises involved with variable interest entities ("VIEs") that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether to consolidate a VIE in its financial statements. This new guidance eliminated a mandatory quantitative approach to determining whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a VIE in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of the "best estimate of selling price" in addition to vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") and third-party evidence ("TPE") for determining the selling price of a deliverable. A vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when VSOE or TPE of the selling price cannot be determined. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted. This update requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is effective for the Company's first quarter of 2011. However, early adoption is allowed. The Company does not expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
In January 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance requiring additional fair value disclosures. These disclosure requirements are effective in two phases. In 2010, the Company adopted the requirements for disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2. The accompanying fair value disclosures comply with these new disclosure requirements. Beginning in 2011, this new accounting guidance will require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company will adopt this expanded disclosure guidance in 2011.
 
 
2. Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The classification of related assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs established for measuring fair value are as follows:
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):
 
 
 
There were no movements between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets during the year ended December 31, 2010.
Debt and equity instruments represent the investments held in a Rabbi Trust under a deferred compensation plan recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The investments consist of mutual funds with quoted market prices that are actively traded.
Derivative assets and liabilities consist of forward foreign exchange contracts that are not actively traded and are valued based on the pricing information that is observable in the market place.
The carrying amount of the Company's other financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, securitized accounts receivable, receivables from Hitachi Ltd. and affiliates, accounts payable, borrowings from and payables to Hitachi and affiliates, accounts receivable-related borrowings and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature; therefore the Company excludes them from the table above.
Non-Financial Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
In 2008 and 2009, due to events and circumstances that adversely affected the fair value of land being readied for sale, the Company performed an impairment analysis that resulted in an impairment charge of $53 million and $3 million, respectively. To determine the fair value of the land, which is classified as a level 3 asset due to the absence of quoted market prices for identical assets and an inherent lack of liquidity, the Company utilized the market approach. Under this approach, management determined a value based upon prices agreed to by other purchasers and sellers in the market for comparable improved properties that had been sold recently or were currently being offered on the market for sale. The prices of these reasonably-substitutable properties were adjusted for factors including market conditions, zoning, location and conditions of sale to ensure comparability to the land being readied for sale. There were no impairment charges incurred in 2010.
 
 
3. Balance Sheet Components
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (in millions):
 
 
Revolving Trade Accounts Receivable Financing Program
In 2006, the Company entered into a five-year revolving trade accounts receivable financing program (the "Program") with a third-party, multi-seller commercial paper conduit ("Conduit") administered by a bank. Under the terms of the Program, the Company sells, on a revolving basis, certain of its trade receivables ("Receivables") to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity ("SPE") which, in turn, sells a senior undivided interest in its Receivables to the Conduit. The Conduit maintains a securitized interest in the Receivables. Senior undivided interests are sold to the Conduit without recourse to the Company or the SPE other than for breaches of representation and warranties as to the qualification of Receivables as of the date of sale and the risk of default on the Receivables, as described below. The SPE was designed so the Company and its creditors will not have access to the SPE's Receivables until the Conduit fully recovers its investment in the senior undivided interest.
The Program allows the Company to sell outstanding senior undivided interest of up to the lower of the amount of eligible trade accounts receivable or $300 million for the period May 19 through and October 19 of each year and up to the lower of the amount of eligible trade accounts receivable or $400 million at other times during the year. The Company services all of the Receivables, as it is responsible for all collection activities with customer obligors, and receives a market servicing fee for those services. The Program requires the SPE to retain an interest in the Receivables that is subordinated to the Conduit's senior undivided interest based on a minimum specified percentage of the Conduit's outstanding senior undivided interest. The Company has no other continuing involvement with the Receivables after the sale of the Receivables.
The Program does not result in a substantive change in the Company's Receivable related risks, as the Company continues to retain the risk from default on the Receivables up to the amount of the SPE retained interest in the Receivables. Historical receivable credit losses have not been significant. At December 31, 2009 and 2010, the SPE's retained interest was greater than the required minimum.
The SPE is a VIE as the SPE does not have substantive legal form equity. The Company consolidates the SPE as the Company controls servicing of the SPE's assets and participates in potentially significant SPE profit or loss through its ownership of the SPE subordinated debt and equity. The Company has never provided non-contractually required financial or other support to the SPE. The Company does not consolidate the Conduit as the Company does not have an economic interest in the Conduit.
The Company's accounting for the SPE's sale of senior undivided interests to the Conduit was based upon different accounting guidance before and after January 1, 2010, as described below.
 
 
Accounting Prior to January 1, 2010
Prior to January 1, 2010, the SPE's transfers of senior undivided interests to the Conduit were accounted for as partial sales of the Receivables in the Company's consolidated financial statements. At the time senior undivided interests were sold to the Conduit, the SPE's net carrying amount of the portion of Receivables sold (based on an allocation between the portions sold and retained based on relative fair value) was removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet, the proceeds from sale were reflected as cash provided by operating activities, and a loss on sale was recognized.
The Company estimated those fair values based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved using the following key assumptions: 1) estimated average life of the Receivable of 42 days, and 2) discount rates of the London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR") + 1.5% for the minimum required retained interest and LIBOR + 0.49% for the remaining retained interest. An immediate adverse change in either the discount rate or in the estimated Receivables life of 10% or 20% would have resulted in a reduction of less than $1 million in the fair value of the retained interest at December 31, 2009.
At December 31, 2009, Receivables transferred to the SPE were $651 million and the carrying value of the SPE's retained interest in the Receivables was $319 million. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding senior undivided interest held by the Conduit was $330 million.
The following table summarizes the net costs associated with the Program (in millions):
 
Losses on sale of Receivables are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, while accretion of the discount on retained subordinated Receivable interest is recorded in interest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from the SPE related to the Program (in millions):
 
Accounting On and After January 1, 2010
Beginning January 1, 2010, the SPE's transfers of senior undivided interests in Receivable to the Conduit did not qualify for sale accounting as they are transfers of senior interests in pools of receivables. Accordingly, they have been accounted for as borrowings on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, with no loss on sale, servicing revenue, or interest income from accretion of the discount on a related retained interest. The Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes $4 million of interest expense on these borrowings.
 
 
The outstanding senior undivided interest in Receivables of $200 million at December 31, 2010 is shown as securitized accounts receivable in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the SPE's retained interest in the Receivables was $446 million and is included with accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. While there has been no change in the arrangement under the Program, the adoption of the required new accounting on January 1, 2010 reduced the Company's net cash flow from operations by $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and increased net cash flow from financing activities by the same amount compared to what they would have been under the accounting the Company followed before January 1, 2010.
Inventories
Inventories consist of the following (in millions):
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in millions, except years):
 
Depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment, including amortization of the related leasehold improvements was $450 million, $391 million and $385 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease arrangement.
 
 
Goodwill
The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows (in millions):
 
Other Intangible Assets
Acquisition-related intangible assets, from the acquisition of Fabrik, Inc. consist of the following (in millions, except years):
 
 
 
 
In 2008, amortization expense related to intangible assets that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the disk drive business of International Business Machines, was $58 million and these intangible assets were fully amortized as of December 31, 2008. In 2009 and 2010, amortization expense related to intangible assets that were acquired as part of the acquisition of Fabrik Inc. was $8 million and $10 million, respectively. Based on existing intangible assets as of December 31, 2010, the remaining estimated amortization expense is as follows (in millions):
 
Lines of Credit with Banks
The Company has uncommitted lines of credit with various financial institutions in China, which provide for borrowings in the aggregate amount of $384 million at December 31, 2010. The Company had $73 million and $62 million outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Interest rates ranged from 1.79% to 1.84% and were based on various term maturities ranging from one day to six months.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht, Singapore Dollar, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen. The total net recognized foreign currency transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were a $3 million loss, $5 million gain and $11 million gain in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The total notional value of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts, presented in U.S. dollar-equivalent amounts, was (in millions):
 
 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following (in millions):
 
 
 
4. Related-Party Transactions with Hitachi Ltd. and Affiliates
Revenue and Other Income
The Company sells certain of its products to Hitachi and affiliates. Revenue related to products sold to Hitachi and affiliates was $391 million, $365 million and $477 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Company also leases facilities to Hitachi and affiliates under operating leases and recognized rental income of $4 million in each of 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Receivables from Hitachi and affiliates total $60 million and $55 million, as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Such receivables include notes and other receivables from Hitachi and affiliates of $14 million and $2 million as of such periods.
Purchase of Production Materials, Equipment and Other Services
The Company purchases production materials from Hitachi and affiliates. Total production materials purchased from Hitachi and affiliates were $59 million, $61 million and $76 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The Company purchases equipment and other services, including facility and equipment maintenance, human resource services and information technology services from Hitachi and affiliates. Total equipment and other services purchased from Hitachi and affiliates were $159 million, $118 million and $173 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Hitachi provides the Company with certain research and development services and the Company reimburses all costs and expenses incurred by Hitachi in connection with the performance of such services. Any patents for inventions derived from the research that the Company entrusts to Hitachi under the research and development agreement are owned by the Company. The term of the agreement automatically renews for subsequent one year terms from April 1 to March 31, unless either party requests termination at least three months prior to the end of the current term. The current term of the agreement ends March 31, 2011; however, because neither party has requested to terminate the agreement, the agreement will automatically renew with a new term ending on March 31, 2012. Costs incurred under this agreement totaled $33 million, $34 million and $40 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The Company maintains licenses with Hitachi for the nonexclusive and nontransferable right to use Hitachi's logo in the Company's trademark, corporate emblem, and trade name in relation to its goods and services during the normal course of business. Hitachi also provides brand advertising. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Company paid Hitachi royalties equal to 0.3% of revenue, excluding those revenues derived from Hitachi and affiliates. The royalty rate increased to 0.4% effective January 1, 2010. Royalty fees were $16 million, $14 million and $22 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The Company purchases consulting and support services from Hitachi related to the application, custody, and maintenance of patents. The Company pays all costs incurred by Hitachi in the performance of these services. Costs incurred for these services were $4 million, $3 million and $2 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The Company entered into lease agreements whereby it leases certain facilities from Hitachi in Japan and elsewhere. The Company expense for these leases totaled $5 million, $5 million and $4 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Hitachi provides the Company with the services of a limited number of executives and employees. Compensation expense related to these executives and employees has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and was not material for any of the periods presented.
Payables to Hitachi and affiliates total $59 million and $71 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
Borrowings
The Company maintains a global credit facility with Hitachi and affiliates that provides funds of up to $1,156 million as of December 31, 2010. This global credit facility allows for various types of borrowings, including short-term and long-term notes and a cash pooling program ("Poolings"). The pooling program is a zero-balance arrangement whereby the Company maintains bank accounts that are automatically provided with funds or swept of excess funds at the end of each day by Hitachi and affiliates. If funds are provided, borrowings increase, whereas if funds are swept, borrowings are reduced.
The following tables summarize the Company's credit facilities with Hitachi and affiliates, including amounts authorized, utilized and available (in millions):
 
 
The aggregate authorized and available amounts of these credit facilities expire in December 2011.
Short-term notes typically have terms varying from one to four months. Amounts borrowed under Poolings do not bear formal repayment terms. The interest rates for both the short-term notes and Poolings ranged from 0.14% to 4.92%, which were calculated by using either the Tokyo inter-bank offered rate plus 0.25% or the LIBOR minus 0.03% to the LIBOR plus 1.23%.
 
 
Included in the above table are two long-term loan agreements entered into in 2009 totaling $72 million in connection with the Company's acquisitions of Fabrik, Inc. and a Sarawak substrate manufacturing facility. The first loan facility with Hitachi America Capital in the amount of $45 million has a three-year term ending in June 2012 and bears a fixed interest rate of 4.9% with interest paid quarterly and an annual principal reduction due on the anniversary date. The second loan facility with Hitachi International Treasury Sdn. Bhd. in the amount of $27 million has a three-year term ending in July 2012 and bears a fixed interest rate of 3.5% with interest paid quarterly and an annual principal reduction due on the anniversary date. As of December 31, 2010, the future principal payments on these notes are as follows (in millions):
 
The current portion of these long-term notes is included in borrowings from Hitachi Ltd. and affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
5. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company has various defined benefit plans in Japan, the United States ("U.S."), the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. The Company's principal plans are in Japan and the U.S. The Company has two noncontributory defined benefit plans in Japan and two in the U.S. The Japanese plans are disclosed separately in the following tables as their total benefit obligations are significant relative to the total benefit obligations of the Company.
The Company has several postretirement benefit plans other than pensions. The principal plans are in the U.S. with an additional plan in the Philippines.
 
 
Obligations and Funded Status
The changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the plans described above were as follows for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
 
The following table presents the unfunded amounts as recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 (in millions):
 
The following table summarizes the amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, before taxes, as of December 31 (in millions):
 
The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $355 million and $454 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
Net losses and prior service credits for the defined benefit pension plans of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, are expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in 2011.
The following table presents information on the Company's pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 (in millions):
 
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The net periodic benefit cost for the plans included the following components for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
 
 
 
In December 2010, the Company decided to modify the terms of its pension plan in the United States such that employees no longer earn defined benefits for future services. Accordingly, future increases in salaries and additional years of service will not change the amount of the U.S. employees' future retirement benefits. This resulted in a net curtailment loss of $8 million in 2010.
Assumptions
Weighted-Average Assumptions
The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans were as follows for the years ended December 31:
 
The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit costs for the plans were as follows for the years ended December 31:
 
The Company develops the discount rate on a country-by-country basis by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. Management then matches the benefit payment streams by year to the AA or higher corporate bond ratings to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. In those countries where there is no active bond market, the Company primarily uses government bonds and other securities with bond-like features and durations that match the average duration of the pension liabilities to determine the appropriate discount rate.
The Company develops the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on a country-by-country basis by analyzing rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investment portfolio applicable to the plan. Management's estimates of future rates of return on assets is based in large part on the projected rate of return from the respective investment managers using a long-term view of historical returns, as well as actuarial recommendations using the most current generational and mortality tables and rates.
The Company develops the rate of compensation increase assumptions on a country-by-country basis using local compensation practices and historical rates of increases.
 
 
Assumed Health Care Cost Trend Rates
The following table presents the assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the non-pension benefit plans, which are selected to represent reasonable expectations of anticipated plan experience and are reviewed annually for appropriateness:
 
Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. However, a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have affected both the total service and interest costs in 2010 and the postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2010 by less than $1 million.
Plan Assets
Investment Policies and Strategies
The investment policy in Japan is to generate a stable return on investments over a long-term horizon in order to have adequate pension funds to meet the Company's future obligations. In order to achieve this investment goal, a diversified portfolio with target asset allocation and expected rate of return is established by considering factors such as composition of participants, level of funded status, capacity to absorb risks, and the current economic environment. The target asset allocation is 24% to 35% in equity securities, 50% to 62% in debt securities and the remaining 3% to 26% in other assets. Risk management is accomplished through diversification, periodic review of plan asset performance, and appropriate realignment of asset allocation. Assumptions regarding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are periodically reviewed and are based on the historical trend of returns, the risk and correlation of each asset, and the latest economic environment.
The investment policy in the U.S. is to invest in a portfolio of common stocks, bonds, cash equivalents, and other investments in order to earn a rate consistent with the risk levels established by the plan committee. The investments shall also be diversified within asset classes (e.g., equities shall be diversified by economic sector, industry, quality, and size). The long-term target asset allocation is based on an investment time horizon in excess of ten years, with 65% in equity (25% large cap domestic, 15% small/mid cap, and 25% international) and 35% in fixed income. The equity segment is intended to provide principal appreciation that exceeds inflation, while the fixed income segment is intended to provide a stable component of return and minimize the overall volatility of the plan. Futures and options are prohibited, as is the use of leverage or margin. In no case (except for mutual fund shares), without waiver by the plan committee, shall a single security exceed 5% of the market value of the equity segment at cost and 10% at market value.
The expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on many factors, including expected forecast for inflation, risk premiums for each asset class, expected asset allocation, current and future financial market conditions, and diversification and rebalancing strategies. Historical return patterns and correlations, consensus return forecasts, and other relevant financial factors are analyzed periodically by the investment advisor so as to ensure that the expected long-term rate of return is reasonable and appropriate.
 
 
Fair Value Measurements
The following table presents the Company's defined benefit pension plans' major asset categories and their associated fair values as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no significant movements of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 categories during the year ended December 31, 2010.
The following table presents the changes in the Level 3 assets during 2010 (in millions):
 
Fair Value Valuation Techniques
Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. Equity commingled/mutual funds are typically valued using the net asset value ("NAV") provided by the investment manager or administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus liabilities and divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. These assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, depending on availability of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets.
 
 
If available, fixed income securities are valued using the close price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other fixed income securities is typically estimated using pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, and is generally classified as Level 2.
Cash includes money market accounts that are valued at their cost plus interest on a daily basis, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments represent securities with original maturities of one year or less. These assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2.
Alternative investment valuations require significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of the underlying assets. These assets are valued based on individual fund manager valuation models utilizing available and relevant market data. These investments are classified as Level 3.
Cash Flows
Contributions
The Company's expected employer contributions for 2011 are $15 million and $17 million for its Japan and U.S. and other pension plans, respectively, and $2 million for its other non-pension benefit plans.
Estimated Future Benefits Payments
The estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service are as follows as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):
 
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company has various defined contribution pension plans available to all of its eligible employees in Japan, the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Thailand. The Company makes contributions which vest over various periods, depending on specific location laws and practices. These plans incurred total costs of $12 million, $13 million and $16 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain eligible employees. This plan is designed to permit elective employee deferrals of compensation combined with employer contributions to be withheld and placed in a Rabbi Trust. The plan permits the employees to diversify these assets through a variety of investment options, primarily mutual funds. The Company consolidates the net assets of the trust as if they are the assets and liabilities of the Company. All earnings and expenses of the Rabbi Trust are recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The corresponding change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is offset against compensation expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The deferred compensation obligation related to the Rabbi Trust was $10 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and was included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
 
6. Redeemable Shares and Shareholder's Equity
Redeemable Shares
Class A and C Preference Shares
The Company has 3,000 Class A preference shares issued and outstanding and 15,000 Class C preference shares issued and outstanding. Such shares are held by Hitachi and are redeemable at the option of the holder at a mutually agreed upon fair value of the shares at the time of redemption.
The Company determines the fair value of redeemable preference shares at the end of each reporting period. The redemption value of preference shares was not significant for any period presented.
Class D Ordinary Shares
The Company's share-based benefit plans provide a participant put right whereby Class D ordinary shares acquired through the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted shares may be exchanged for cash consideration at the prevailing fair value. The share-based benefit plans also provide the Company with the right to repurchase any or all of a participant's ordinary shares acquired through the share-based benefit plans at the prevailing fair value. The participants' put rights and the Company's repurchase rights may be exercised prior to the beginning of the period of not less than 90 days, nor more than 270 days, immediately preceding the closing of an initial public offering, provided that the ordinary shares must have been issued and outstanding for a period of at least six months. The participants' put right and the Company's repurchase rights lapse upon either the closing of an initial public offering or a change in control in which the awards are assumed by the successor corporation and become vested or exercisable.
As a result of the redemption features discussed above, the Company determines the intrinsic value of redeemable share-based awards at the end of each reporting period based on the redemption value of the underlying ordinary shares and the proportion of consideration received in the form of employee services rendered. Such amounts are recorded outside of permanent equity. The redemption value of such awards under the Company's share-based benefit plans was $19 million as of December 31, 2010, and consisted entirely of share options and restricted share units for which the underlying ordinary shares are redeemable at the prevailing fair value upon redemption. There were no exercises of options or vesting of restricted share units through December 31, 2010.
Shareholder's Equity
Exchange of Shares
In November 2010, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, which subsequently changed its name to Viviti Technologies Ltd. as described in Note 1, became the holding company of the Company's business and operations and the parent company of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands, B.V. In connection with the change in domicile to Singapore, the Company issued Class A and Class C preference shares and Class B ordinary shares in the capital of the Company to Hitachi in exchange, on a one-for one basis, for the issued and outstanding preference shares Series A and Series C and ordinary shares Series B in the capital of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. held by Hitachi.
 
 
Voting Rights
Each share of Class A and Class C preference shares and each share of Class B ordinary shares have 100 votes per share. Each share of Class D ordinary shares has one vote per share.
Dividends
Holders of Class A and Class C preference shares are entitled to dividends of $0.014 and $1.36 per share, respectively, when and if declared.
Liquidation
Class A and Class C preference shares have preference share liquidation rights of $191,000 and $8,000 per share, respectively. If the Company is dissolved, the holders of Class A and Class C preference shares shall receive an amount per issued share equivalent to the liquidation price per share plus all unpaid dividends per share. Any balance remaining after payment to the holders of Class A and Class C preference shares shall be distributed among the holders of Class B and Class D ordinary shares in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held by each such holder.
7. Share-Based Compensation
Share-Based Compensation Plans
In February 2010, the Company approved two share-based compensation plans: the Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. 2009 Equity Plan and the Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. 2009 Senior Executive Officer Equity Plan. In November 2010, in connection with its change in domicile from the Netherlands to Singapore, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. assumed Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V.'s equity incentive plans and such plans were renamed the Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. 2010 Equity Plan and the Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. 2010 Senior Executive Officer Equity Plan (collectively, "the Plans"). Under the Plans, employees, senior executives, members of the board of directors and consultants may be granted options to purchase ordinary shares, restricted share units, which entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share, and share appreciation rights, which entitle the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the appreciation in the Company's ordinary shares over a period of time.
The Plans permit the grant of equity awards of up to 9.8 million Class D ordinary shares. Under the Plans, each award type has the following terms:
 Share options vest annually over four years, are exercisable for a period of seven years from the date of issuance and are generally granted at prices equal to the fair market value at the grant date. The option awards provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a change of control if the successor company refuses to assume unvested options.
Share Options
 Restricted share units may be granted under the Plans with varying criteria such as service-based or performance-based vesting. Service-based vesting provides for vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date. Prior to vesting, restricted share units do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the restricted share units are not considered issued and outstanding. Shares are issued on the date the restricted share units vest. The restricted share unit awards provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a change of control if the successor company refuses to assume unvested restricted share units. In addition, the restricted share units provide for accelerated vesting upon the closing of an initial public offering. If the Company closes an initial public offering:
Restricted Share Units
 
 
 
 
 Share appreciation rights vest annually over four years, are exercisable for a period of seven years from the date of issuance and are granted at prices not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Holders of share appreciation rights are entitled to receive payment in cash for the difference between the fair market value of the underlying equity share on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the share appreciation right multiplied by the number of share appreciation rights exercised. The Plans allow the Company to settle exercised share appreciation rights with Class D ordinary shares of equivalent value and to substitute a share option for all or any portion of an unexercised share appreciation right. The Company accounts for share appreciation rights as liability awards based upon management's intention to settle such awards in cash.
Share Appreciation Rights
Compensation Expense
The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation for options, restricted share units, and share appreciation rights for the year ended December 31, 2010, by line item in the consolidated statement of operations (in millions):
 
There were no corresponding share-based compensation amounts in any other periods presented.
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to options granted but not yet exercised was $17 million, net of estimated forfeitures and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.8 years.
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted share units granted but not yet vested was $5 million, net of estimated forfeitures and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 2.3 years.
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to share appreciation rights granted but not yet vested, based on the fair value of the Company's shares as of December 31, 2010, was $10 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.7 years.
Valuation and Other Assumptions
Fair Value of Class D Ordinary Shares
The valuation of the equity and equity-based awards issued under the Plans was based on the fair value of the underlying shares.
 
 
The Company's board of directors or the delegated representative(s) of the board of directors approved the fair value of the Class D ordinary shares in part by referring to contemporaneously-obtained valuation reports that refer to both the market approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value at each valuation date. Factors considered in the valuation included an analysis of general market data, including economic, governmental, and environmental factors; the Company's historic, current and future state of operations; the Company's current and historical operating and financial results; the Company's forecasts; the financial data for publicly traded companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and other facts and data considered pertinent to the valuation to arrive at an estimated fair market value.
Both the market approach and the income approach were utilized in estimating the value of the Company's equity. The market approach measures the enterprise value of a company through the analysis of different market variables of comparable companies. Consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the Company being valued relative to those of publicly traded comparable companies. The Company's market approach utilized an analysis of the market multiples of comparable companies. When choosing the comparable companies to be used for the market approach, the Company focused on companies in its industry. The income approach measures the value of a company as the present value of its future economic benefits by applying an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to expected cash flows, based on forecasted revenues and costs, while analyzing observed market valuation multiples of revenue. The enterprise values for the market and income approaches were then weighted based on the Company's determination of the relevance of each method in estimating the value of its ordinary shares. The resulting estimated fair value of the Company's ordinary shares at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount in recognition of the fact that the Company's shareholders cannot freely trade the Company's ordinary shares in the public markets.
Share Option Valuation
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. In addition to the fair value of the ordinary shares, the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the following:
 The Company calculated the expected weighted-average option term as the average of the contractual term and the average vesting period, due to the lack of sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term.
Expected Term
 The Company determined expected volatility based on an analysis of historical share prices and implied volatilities of publicly-traded companies that have granted options with substantially similar terms and which have similar business profiles, including industry and growth.
Expected Volatility
 The Company based its interest rate on a U.S. Treasury risk-free zero-coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of the option grants.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 The Company has not historically paid any cash dividends on its outstanding share capital and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Expected Dividends
The Company's calculated share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest as reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses industry data and future expectations of employee turnover, as well as analysis of actual forfeited awards, to estimate forfeiture rates. The impact from a forfeiture rate adjustment is recognized in full in the period of adjustment.
 
 
The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Company's option awards in 2010:
 
The Company recognizes share-based compensation over the requisite service period.
Restricted Share Units Valuation
The fair value of each restricted share unit award was estimated on the grant date using the value of Class D ordinary shares. The Company uses estimated forfeiture rates to recognize compensation costs only for those restricted share unit awards expected to vest.
Share Appreciation Rights Valuation
The fair value of each share appreciation right is estimated based on each award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The share-based compensation liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date. The share-based liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period. The Company uses estimated forfeiture rates on unvested awards to calculate a liability only for those share appreciation rights expected to vest. The total vested portion of the share appreciation right awards (the compensation liability) represents the proportion of the fair value of the share appreciation right awards vested based upon the percentage of the required service rendered at the reporting date. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of its share appreciation rights over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of each award as if the awards are, in-substance, multiple awards. This liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the date of settlement.
Share Option Activity
The following table summarizes the option activity:
 
The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the fair value of the Company's Class D ordinary shares for all in-the-money options. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2010 was $9.38 per share.
The Company will settle employee share option exercises with newly issued Class D ordinary shares.
 
 
Restricted Share Unit Activity
The following table summarizes the restricted share unit activity (in millions, except per share amounts):
 
The Company will settle vested restricted share units with newly issued Class D ordinary shares.
Share Appreciation Right Activity
The following table summarizes the share appreciation rights activity (in millions, except per share amounts):
 
The Company has a liability for share appreciation rights of $6 million included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.
8. Restructuring
To better align the Company's operations with its current business structure, the Company implemented restructuring plans based on certain assumptions regarding the optimal cost structure of the Company's business and its ability to support profitable growth in the future. The following table summarizes total restructuring charges (in millions):
 
 
 
The details of the individual plans are as follows:
2008 Restructuring Plan
In 2008, the Company terminated a subcontract manufacturing arrangement to more fully utilize its existing manufacturing capacity in China and implemented a workforce reduction program to improve its business efficiency. Total exit and termination costs related to the subcontract manufacturing arrangement were $34 million. Additionally, there were 213 employees worldwide affected by the workforce reduction, resulting in total charges for employee termination benefits of $9 million.
2009 Restructuring Plan
In 2009, the Company implemented a workforce reduction program to optimize its organization and cost structure and to realign the Company's resources to meet its key strategic initiatives. There were 565 employees worldwide affected by this plan, resulting in charges for employee termination benefits of $13 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. All actions under the 2009 Restructuring Plan were initiated and substantially completed during 2009.
2010 Restructuring Plan
In 2010, to further optimize its manufacturing efficiency, the Company initiated a closure of its media manufacturing operations in San Jose, California to proceed with the consolidation of media manufacturing in Shenzhen, China. The closure and transitioning activities are anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Approximately 170 employees were affected by the aforementioned consolidation, resulting in charges for employee termination benefits of $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.
Restructuring Liability
The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's restructuring liability during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 (in millions):
 
The restructuring liability is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
9. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") to sell to a real estate developer (the "Developer") certain parcels of land located in San Jose, California, which had been the site of various office and manufacturing facilities. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company was required to perform certain activities, such as obtaining local government approval of site plans, demolishing certain buildings, completing any environmental remediation, and performing other required infrastructure changes prior to transferring the site to the buyer at the close of escrow.
 
 
In 2008, the real estate market began to experience a significant decline and the Developer requested the Company renegotiate the sales price. Ultimately, the parties did not agree to a price reduction. Additionally, the Developer notified the Company of certain contractual disputes and management determined it was unlikely the Developer would consummate the sale and close escrow as stipulated under the terms of the Agreement. The Company evaluated the recoverability of the land and recorded $53 million of impairment charges in 2008.
In 2009, the Company and the Developer determined that the sale would not be consummated and each party asserted claims against the other in arbitration for breach of contract and entitlement to a deposit previously paid by the Developer to the Company. Based on the continuing downturn in both the economy and the real estate market, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the land and recorded a $3 million impairment charge in 2009.
In 2010, the arbitration related to the Developer's deposit was settled in favor of the Company, resulting in a $10 million gain that is included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
10. Income Taxes
The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):
 
Income before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest consisted of the following (in millions):
 
 
 
Effective Tax Rate
The domestic statutory income tax rate for the Netherlands was 25.5% in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, Hitachi GST was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore and became the successor to Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. The domestic statutory tax rate in Singapore is 17.0%. The reconciling items for the difference between the income taxes expected based on the statutory income tax rate and the provision for income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations consisted of the following (in millions):
 
Deferred Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The following table presents the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions):
 
 
 
Non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities stated above relate to several jurisdictions and are measured by applying the respective jurisdiction's enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
In 2009, the valuation allowance increased by $14 million. The increase was mainly due to future tax benefits that would not be recognized due to the uncertainty regarding the realization of long-term deferred tax assets recorded by the Company's U.S. operations.
In 2010, the Company evaluated the realization of deferred tax assets and determined, based upon the Company's historical profitability and financial projections, the assets were realizable on a more likely than not basis in the United States and China. As a result of this evaluation, a tax benefit of $26 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, the Company recorded $60 million and $73 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets for its operations in Japan, and $32 million and $33 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets for its operations in the U.S. The realization of these deferred tax assets primarily depends on the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in Japan and the U.S. in future years. The Company's management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable; however, may increase or decrease as the Company periodically reevaluates in the future the underlying basis for its estimates of future taxable income.
The Company has not recognized deferred tax liabilities on the cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in Singapore. Net undistributed earnings at December 31, 2010 on which no tax has been provided amounted to $388 million. The tax liability on these earnings would approximate $47 million if the Company repatriated the $388 million in undistributed earnings from the foreign subsidiaries.
Tax Holidays
The Company maintains its manufacturing operations in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines under tax holidays, which are subject to certain restrictions and conditions. The tax holidays will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2013 and through the year 2023. Certain of the tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax holidays and tax incentive programs was to increase the Company's net income by $22 million in 2008 ($0.25 per share, diluted), by $9 million in 2009 ($0.10 per share, diluted) and by $27 million in 2010 ($0.30 per share, diluted).
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2010, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $113 million, of which $112 million are foreign. The domestic net operating loss carryforward of $1 million will expire in 2019. The $112 million foreign net operating loss carryforward consists of $89 million related to the Netherlands B.V. operations, which will expire at various dates from 2013 through 2019 and $23 million related to U.S. operations, which will expire at various dates from 2025 through 2029. The net operating losses related to the U.S. operations are subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
As of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $65 million, $61 million and $63 million, respectively. Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, $64 million, $59 million and $61 million, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
 
 
The following table presents the changes in the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):
 
The Company's policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2010, the Company reduced accrued penalties by a net amount of $1.5 million and reduced interest by a net amount of $0.2 million related to its unrecognized tax benefits and recognized a liability for penalties of $6.9 million and interest of $5.6 million as of December 31, 2010. During 2009, the Company accrued no penalties and interest of $2 million and recognized a liability for penalties of $8 million and interest of $6 million as of December 31, 2009. During 2008, the Company accrued penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $2 million.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company expects to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by $18 million to $24 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next twelve months. However, the resolution of and/or timing of closure on open audits are highly uncertain as to when these events occur.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the Netherlands, the U.S., and various other foreign jurisdictions. The following table presents the open tax years, by major tax jurisdiction, as of December 31, 2010:
 
 
 
11. Earnings Per Share
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in millions, except per share amounts):
 
The Company excluded 3.1 million options to purchase ordinary shares, restricted share units and stock appreciation rights from the computation of diluted net income per share in the year ended December 31, 2010, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
12. Acquisitions
2009 Acquisitions
Sarawak Substrate Manufacturing Facility
On July 1, 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of a substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia ("Sarawak"). The acquisition of Sarawak strategically expands the Company's manufacturing capabilities. Total consideration, payable in cash, was $38 million.
The Company identified and recorded the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. No intangible assets were identified.
Fabrik, Inc.
On April 1, 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of Fabrik, Inc ("Fabrik"), a San Mateo, California, privately-held supplier of personal and professional storage solutions. The acquisition strategically expands the Company's branded solutions business. Total consideration, payable in cash to the Fabrik shareholders, was $45 million.
 
 
The Company identified and recorded the assets, including specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Fabrik at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows (in millions):
 
Intangible assets of $40 million relate to customer relationships and trade names, which are amortized to selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations over a weighted-average useful life of five years, and existing technology, which is amortized to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations over a weighted-average useful life of three years.
13. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings and other claims, including those noted below. The Company presently believes that the outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. However, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The outcomes of these matters are not reasonably estimable.
Intellectual Property Litigation
On December 1, 2010, Rambus, Inc. filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission pursuant to 19 U.S.C. Section 1337 alleging that six "Primary Respondent" semiconductor chip companies and twenty seven "Customer Respondents," including the Company, infringe various U.S. patents. On December 29, 2010, the ITC initiated an investigation into Rambus' allegations in response to the complaint. The Company is accused of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 6,591,353; 7,287,109; 7,602,857; 7,602,858; and 7,715,494. The complaint alleges that certain of the Company's hard drives that contain DDR-type memory controllers, SATA interfaces, PCI Express interfaces, DisplayPort interfaces, or SAS interfaces infringe the patents. The complaint seeks to enjoin the importation into the U.S. of the allegedly infringing semiconductor chips and products. It also requests a cease-and-desist order preventing the parties from exhausting allegedly infringing inventory in the U.S. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this case.
On December 12, 2008, plaintiffs MagSil Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or, collectively, MagSil, filed a complaint in the District of Delaware against the Company and seven other companies in the disk drive industry alleging infringement of two patents. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. In January 2010, MagSil amended its complaint to allege infringement of only one patent. The asserted patent allegedly relates to tunneling magneto resistive technology. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
On June 18, 2008, plaintiff Convolve, Inc., or Convolve, filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and two other companies alleging infringement of two patents. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October 10, 2008, Convolve amended its complaint to allege infringement of only one patent. The patent allegedly relates to interface technology to select between certain modes of a disk drive's operations relating to speed and noise. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
On July 15, 2009, plaintiffs Carl B. Collins and Farzin Davanloo filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and ten other companies alleging infringement of two patents. The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, fees and costs. The asserted patents allegedly relate to nanophase diamond films technology. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
 
 
Other Matters
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not materially or adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters could differ materially from those projected.
Accrued Warranty
The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's warranty liability (in millions):
 
Indemnification
The Company periodically indemnifies certain customers with whom it enters into a contractual relationship in addition to its offered product warranties. In these cases, the Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against third-party claims that its products, when used for their intended purpose(s), infringe the intellectual property rights of such third party or other claims made against certain parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim. Historically, the Company has not made payments under these obligations and believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Leases
The Company leases certain equipment and facilities under various operating leases. The lease terms for equipment and facilities range from one to twelve years, with renewal options at the end of the lease terms for most of the leases. Rent expense was $28 million, $21 million and $25 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The Company leases certain equipment under capital leases. The cost and accumulated amortization for assets under capital leases, which were included in property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
The amortization expense related to these leased assets was $2 million, $4 million and $3 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Future minimum payments under capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases are as follows as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):
 
The current and non-current portions of the capital lease obligations are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Purchase Obligations
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):
 
 
14. Business Segment and Geographic Information
The Company operates in one reportable segment, the disk drive business. All operating segments have been aggregated due to their inter-dependencies, commonality of long-term economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, class of customers and distribution processes. The Company has determined that its Chief Executive Officer is the Company's chief operating decision maker and he is responsible for reviewing and approving investments in the Company's technology platforms and manufacturing infrastructure.
 
 
The following table summarizes the Company's revenue by geographic area, based on the ship-to location of the customer (in millions):
 
One customer accounted for 13%, 12% and 15% of consolidated revenue in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, while another customer accounted for 11% of consolidated revenue in 2009. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented.
One customer accounted for 12%, while another customer accounted for 11% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2008. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2009. One customer accounted for 16% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2010. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable in any period presented.
The following table summarizes the Company's long-lived assets, excluding land being readied for sale, based on geographic area (in millions):

1. Basis of Presentation and Pending Acquisition
Viviti Technologies Ltd. ("Viviti" or the "Company"), formerly Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. ("Hitachi" or the "Parent"). The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A of Western Digital Corporation ("WDC") dated May 10, 2012. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions have been applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual results could differ from those estimates.
On March 8, 2012 Western Digital Corporation ("WDC") completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding share capital of Viviti Technologies Ltd.
2. Supplemental Financial Data
Accounts Receivable Factoring Program
In April, 2011, the Company entered into a one-year agreement with a bank that allows the Company to sell certain of its receivables. Under this program, the Company sells all of its right, title and interest of the receivables being sold, but none of the underlying obligations to the applicable debtor. The Company receives the aggregate amount of the sold receivables, less the defined discount margin. The transaction qualifies as a sale and the bank has no recourse to the Company and the Company does not have any liability to the bank for any default of payment, except in certain defined cases. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company sold $15 and $81 million, respectively, under this program.
Inventories
Inventories consist of the following (in millions):
 
 
Accrued Warranty
Warranty costs are accrued when revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of one to five years. The warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and estimated warranty fulfillment costs, which include the estimated cost and mix of providing customers with replacement drives, repaired drives, or customer compensatory claims for product quality issues. The Company uses a statistical warranty tracking model that considers historical trends to develop estimates of future warranty costs. The estimated future warranty costs are affected by warranty terms offered, the warranty period, shipment volumes, product failure rates and warranty fulfillment costs. Warranty estimates involve a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base the Company's warranty estimates. For new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists, warranty information from previous similar products is used to estimate the warranty accrual. The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's warranty liability (in millions):
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income consists of the following (in millions):
 
Noncontrolling Interest
In September 2011, the Company purchased the aggregate 20% ownership held by others in the Company's consolidated majority-owned subsidiary, Shenzhen Hailiang Storage Products Company Limited in China for $18 million.
Gain on Settlement of Arbitration
The Company had agreed to sell its land being readied for sale to a real estate developer. When the developer did not close escrow, the Company entered into arbitration over the developer's deposit on the land. In the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the arbitration related to the deposit was settled in favor of the Company, resulting in a $10 million gain that is included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
 
3. Net Income per Share
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in millions, except per share amounts):
 
 
4. Debt
Lines of Credit with Banks
The Company has uncommitted lines of credit with various financial institutions in China, which provide for borrowings in the aggregate amount of $339 million at September 30, 2011. The Company had $0 and $62 million outstanding under these lines of credit at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively. Interest rates ranged from 1.70% to 1.91% during the time the line of credit was in use during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and were based on various term maturities ranging from one day to six months.
Borrowings under the Revolving Trade Accounts Receivable Financing Program
The Company securitizes certain of its accounts receivable through a revolving trade accounts receivable financing program which allows it to sell, on a revolving basis, certain of its trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a senior undivided interest in those receivables to a third-party, multi-seller, commercial paper conduit. The conduit funds its interest in the pool of eligible receivables through the issuance of commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. The commercial paper is secured by future collections of the eligible trade accounts receivable and the Company retains the servicing responsibility over the purchased receivables. The Company may sell senior undivided interest in its eligible trade accounts receivable of up to the lower of the eligible trade accounts receivable borrowing base or up to $400 million for the duration of the agreement, which currently terminates in February 2013.
 
The transfers of senior undivided interests in the eligible receivables to the conduit are accounted for as borrowings on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no outstanding senior undivided interest in Receivables at September 30, 2011. The outstanding senior undivided interest in Receivables of $0 and $200 million at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, is shown as securitized accounts receivable in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of the retained interest in the Receivables was $0 and $446 million at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and is included with accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Related-Party Borrowings
The Company maintains a global credit facility with Hitachi and affiliates that provides funds of up to $1,203 million as of September 30, 2011. This global credit facility allows for various types of borrowings, including short-term and long-term notes and a cash pooling program ("Poolings"). The pooling program is a zero-balance arrangement whereby the Company maintains bank accounts that are automatically provided with funds or swept of excess funds at the end of each day by Hitachi and affiliates. If funds are provided, borrowings increase, whereas if funds are swept, borrowings are reduced.
The following tables summarize the Company's credit facilities with Hitachi and affiliates, including amounts authorized, utilized and available (in millions):
 
 
 
The aggregate authorized and available amounts of these credit facilities expire in December 2011.
Short-term notes typically have terms varying from one to four months. Amounts borrowed under Poolings do not bear formal repayment terms. The interest rates for both the short-term notes and Poolings ranged from 0.21% to 1.23% during the nine month period ended September 30, 2011, which were calculated by using either the Tokyo inter-bank offered rate plus 0.25% or the LIBOR minus 0.03% to the LIBOR plus 1.23%.
The December 31, 2010 table includes $62 million related to two long-term loan agreements, one Hitachi America Capital and one with Hitachi International Treasury Sdn. Bhd. The current portions of these two loans is included in borrowings from Hitachi Ltd. and affiliates in the accompanying consolidated December 31, 2010 balance sheet. The term of these loans extended through July 2012; however, the Company repaid the entire loan amounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
5. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings and other claims, including those noted below. The Company presently believes that the outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. However, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The outcomes of these matters are not reasonably estimable.
Intellectual Property Litigation
On December 1, 2010, Rambus, Inc. filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission pursuant to 19 U.S.C. Section 1337 alleging that six "Primary Respondent" semiconductor chip companies and twenty seven "Customer Respondents," including the Company, infringe various U.S. patents. On December 29, 2010, the ITC initiated an investigation into Rambus' allegations in response to the complaint. The Company is accused of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 6,591,353; 7,287,109; 7,602,857; 7,602,858; and 7,715,494. The complaint alleges that certain of the Company's hard drives that contain DDR-type memory controllers, SATA interfaces, PCI Express interfaces, DisplayPort interfaces, or SAS interfaces infringe the patents. The complaint seeks to enjoin the importation into the U.S. of the allegedly infringing semiconductor chips and products. It also requests a cease-and-desist order preventing the parties from exhausting allegedly infringing inventory in the U.S. The ITC Judge issued an initial order finding the Company did not violate Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and awaits final confirmation by the Commission. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this case.
 
On December 12, 2008, plaintiffs Magsil Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or, collectively, MagSil, filed a complaint in the District of Delaware against the Company and seven other companies in the disk drive industry alleging patent infringement of technology relating to tunneling magneto resistive technology. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. A finding of patent invalidity and non-infringement is now on appeal. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
On June 18, 2008, plaintiff Convolve, Inc., or Convolve, filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and two other companies alleging patent infringement of technology allegedly relating to interface selection between speed and noise modes of a disk drive's operations. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. A jury verdict finding willful infringement against the Company awaits final confirmation from the trial judge. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
On July 15, 2009, plaintiffs Carl B. Collins and Farzin Davanloo filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and ten other companies alleging infringement of two patents. The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, fees and costs. The asserted patents allegedly relate to nanophase diamond films technology. The Company intends to vigorously defend the infringement allegations.
Other Matters
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not materially or adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters could differ materially from those projected.
Indemnification
The Company periodically indemnifies certain customers with whom it enters into a contractual relationship in addition to its offered product warranties. In these cases, the Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against third-party claims that its products, when used for their intended purpose(s), infringe the intellectual property rights of such third party or other claims made against certain parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim. Historically, the Company has not made payments under these obligations and believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
6. Income Taxes
The Company's income tax (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2011 was ($2) million as compared to ($22) million in the prior-year period. The Company's income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $15 million as compared to $12 million in the prior-year period. The differences between the effective tax rate and the Singapore statutory tax rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand that expire at various dates through 2023 and the current year generation of income tax credits.
The Company had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $55 million. Interest and penalties recognized on such amounts was $9 million.
 
The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next twelve months. It is not possible to estimate the amount of any additional changes, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any additional significant changes in the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of the Company's uncertain tax positions.
7. Fair Value Measurement
Measurement of Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The classification of related assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs established for measuring fair value are as follows:
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):
 
 
 
There were no significant movements between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Debt and equity instruments represent the investments held in a Rabbi Trust under a deferred compensation plan recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The investments consist of mutual funds with quoted market prices that are actively traded.
Derivative assets and liabilities consist of forward foreign exchange contracts that are not actively traded and are valued based on the pricing information that is observable in the market place.
The carrying amount of the Company's other financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, securitized accounts receivable, receivables from Hitachi Ltd. and affiliates, accounts payable, borrowings from and payables to Hitachi and affiliates, accounts receivable-related borrowings and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature; therefore the Company excludes them from the table above.
8. Foreign Exchange Contracts
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht, Singapore Dollar, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen. These contracts are typically designated as balance sheet hedges, generally have maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months and are for risk management purposes only.
The total net recognized foreign currency transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses resulted in $5,281 million and $6.4 million of gain in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.
 
9. Share-Based Compensation
Compensation Expense
The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation for options, restricted share units, and share appreciation rights for the periods presented (in millions):
 
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to options granted but not yet exercised was $13 million, net of estimated forfeitures and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.5 years.
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted share units granted but not yet vested was $4 million, net of estimated forfeitures and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.6 years.
The total unrecognized compensation cost related to share appreciation rights granted but not yet vested, based on the fair value of the Company's shares as of September 30, 2011, was $12 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.4 years.
Valuation and Other Assumptions
Fair Value of Class D Ordinary Shares
The valuation of the equity and equity-based awards issued under the Plans was based on the fair value of the underlying shares.
The Company's board of directors or the delegated representative(s) of the board of directors approved the fair value of the Class D Ordinary shares in part by referring to contemporaneously-obtained valuation reports that refer to both the market approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value at each valuation date. Factors considered in the valuation included an analysis of general market data, including economic, governmental, and environmental factors; the Company's historic, current and future state of operations; the Company's current and historical operating and financial results; the Company's forecasts; the financial data for publicly traded companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and other facts and data considered pertinent to the valuation to arrive at an estimated fair market value.
Both the market approach and the income approach were utilized in estimating the value of the Company's equity. The market approach measures the enterprise value of a company through the analysis of different market variables of comparable companies. Consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the Company being valued relative to those of publicly traded comparable companies. The Company's market approach utilized an analysis of the market multiples of comparable companies. When choosing the comparable companies to be used for the market approach, the Company focused on companies in its industry. The income approach measures the value of a company as the present value of its future economic benefits by applying an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to expected cash flows, based on forecasted revenues and costs, while analyzing observed market valuation multiples of revenue. The enterprise values for the market and income approaches were then weighted based on the Company's determination of the relevance of each method in estimating the value of its ordinary shares. The resulting estimated fair value of the Company's ordinary shares at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount in recognition of the fact that the Company's shareholders cannot freely trade the Company's ordinary shares in the public markets.
 
Share Option Valuation
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. In addition to the fair value of the ordinary shares, the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the following:
 The Company calculated the expected weighted-average option term as the average of the contractual term and the average vesting period, due to the lack of sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term.
Expected Term
 The Company determined expected volatility based on an analysis of historical share prices and implied volatilities of publicly-traded companies that have granted options with substantially similar terms and which have similar business profiles, including industry and growth.
Expected Volatility
 The Company based its interest rate on a U.S. Treasury risk-free zero-coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of the option grants.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 The Company has not historically paid any cash dividends on its outstanding share capital and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Expected Dividends
The Company's calculated share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest as reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses industry data and future expectations of employee turnover, as well as analysis of actual forfeited awards, to estimate forfeiture rates. The impact from a forfeiture rate adjustment is recognized in full in the period of adjustment.
The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Company's option awards in the periods presented:
 
The Company recognizes the compensation cost of its options over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of each award as if the awards are, in-substance, multiple awards.
Restricted Share Units Valuation
The fair value of each restricted share unit award was estimated on the grant date using the value of Class D Ordinary shares. The Company uses estimated forfeiture rates to recognize compensation costs only for those restricted share unit awards expected to vest. The Company recognizes share-based compensation over the requisite service period  a three-year cliff vest.
 
Share Appreciation Rights Valuation
The Company accounts for share appreciation rights as liability awards based upon management's intention to settle such awards in cash. The fair value of each share appreciation right is estimated based on each award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The share-based compensation liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date. The share-based liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period. The Company uses estimated forfeiture rates on unvested awards to calculate a liability only for those share appreciation rights expected to vest. The total vested portion of the share appreciation right awards (the compensation liability) represents the proportion of the fair value of the share appreciation right awards vested based upon the percentage of the required service rendered at the reporting date. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of its share appreciation rights over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of each award as if the awards are, in-substance, multiple awards. This liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the date of settlement.
Share Option Activity
The following table summarizes the option activity:
 
The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the fair value of the Company's Class D ordinary shares for all in-the-money options. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $0 and $24.51 per share, respectively.
The Company will settle employee share option exercises with newly issued Class D ordinary shares.
 
Restricted Share Unit Activity
The following table summarizes the restricted share unit activity:
 
The Company will settle vested restricted share units with newly issued Class D ordinary shares. The aggregate fair value of the shares underlying they restricted share units granted in the nine months ended 2011 was $817 million at the date of grant.
Share Appreciation Right Activity
The following table summarizes the share appreciation rights activity:
 
The Company's liability for share appreciation rights was $17 million and $6 million at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.
 
10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted the expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures required by the FASB's October 2009 accounting guidance related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of the "best estimate of selling price" in addition to vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") and third-party evidence ("TPE") for determining the selling price of a deliverable. A vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when VSOE or TPE of the selling price cannot be determined. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted the expanded disclosures required by the FASB's January 2010 accounting guidance requiring additional fair value disclosures. This new accounting guidance requires presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's ("FASB") amendments to the accounting guidance for the transfers of financial assets, which eliminated the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. As a result of this amendment, many types of transferred financial assets that previously qualified for de-recognition from the balance sheet no longer qualify, including certain securitized accounts receivable. In particular, this amendment removed the undivided interest concept and introduced the concept of a participating interest as a unit of account. The amendment reiterates the requirement that in order for a transfer of accounts receivable to qualify as a sale, effective control must be transferred. If the accounts receivable transferred meet the definition of a participating interest, the transfer qualifies for sale accounting. Because the accounts receivable transferred under the Company's securitization arrangement did not meet the definition of a participating interest, the arrangement failed to meet the new requirements of a complete transfer of control, and could not continue to be treated as a sale. As a result of the adoption of these amendments, effective January 1, 2010, the Company began recording securitized accounts receivable in its consolidated financial statements and began recognizing the outstanding amount of senior undivided interests as borrowings.
Effective January 1, 2010, the Company also adopted the FASB's amendment to the accounting guidance for enterprises involved with variable interest entities ("VIEs") that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether to consolidate a VIE in its financial statements. This new guidance eliminated a mandatory quantitative approach to determining whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a VIE in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, an update to existing guidance on the assessment of goodwill impairment. The ASU simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment by allowing companies to consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two step impairment review process. It also amends the examples of events or circumstances that would be considered in a goodwill impairment evaluation. The ASU is effective for the Company's first quarter of 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
"Testing Goodwill for Impairment,"
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, The ASU requires companies to report comprehensive income, including items of other comprehensive income, for all periods presented in a single continuous financial statement in the Consolidated Statements of Operations or split between the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a separate Consolidated Statements of Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The ASU is effective for the Company's first quarter of 2012. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Comprehensive Income (ASC Topic 220)Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
 
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, The ASU requires additional disclosures about the sensitivity to changes in unobservable inputs for Level 3 measurements. In addition, for items that are not measured at fair value on the balance sheet but for which the disclosure of fair values in the footnotes is required, the ASU requires disclosures of the categorization by level within the fair value hierarchy. The ASU is effective for the Company's first quarter of 2012. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurement (ASC Topic 820)Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.

The Company's policy is to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding or taxing authorities in the countries in which the plans reside.
 
13. Redeemable Shares and Shareholder's Equity
Redeemable Shares
Class A and C Preference Shares
The Company has 3,000 Class A preference shares issued and outstanding and 15,000 Class C preference shares issued and outstanding. Such shares are held by Hitachi and are redeemable at the option of the holder at a mutually agreed upon fair value of the shares at the time of redemption.
The Company determines the fair value of redeemable preference shares at the end of each reporting period. The redemption value of preference shares was not significant for any period presented.
Class D Ordinary Shares
The Company's share-based benefit plans provide a participant put right whereby Class D ordinary shares acquired through the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted shares may be exchanged for cash consideration at the prevailing fair value. The share-based benefit plans also provide the Company with the right to repurchase any or all of a participant's ordinary shares acquired through the share-based benefit plans at the prevailing fair value. The participants' put rights and the Company's repurchase rights may be exercised prior to the beginning of the period of not less than 90 days, nor more than 270 days, immediately preceding the closing of an initial public offering, provided that the ordinary shares must have been issued and outstanding for a period of at least six months. The participants' put right and the Company's repurchase rights lapse upon either the closing of an initial public offering or a change in control in which the awards are assumed by the successor corporation and become vested or exercisable.
As a result of the redemption features discussed above, the Company determines the intrinsic value of redeemable share-based awards at the end of each reporting period based on the redemption value of the underlying ordinary shares and the proportion of consideration received in the form of employee services rendered. Such amounts are recorded outside of permanent equity. The redemption value of such awards under the Company's share-based benefit plans was $84 million and $19 million as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and consisted entirely of share options and restricted share units for which the underlying ordinary shares are redeemable at the prevailing fair value upon redemption. There were no exercises of options or vesting of restricted share units through September 30, 2011.
Shareholder's Equity
Exchange of Shares
In March 2010, Hitachi GST effected a 10,000-for-1 stock split of the Company's ordinary shares series B and a 1,000:1 stock split of the Company's preference shares series C. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this stock split. In addition, the Company authorized 23 million ordinary shares, series D.
In November 2010, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, became the holding company of the Company's business and operations and the parent company of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands, B.V. In connection with the change in domicile to Singapore, the Company issued Class A and Class C preference shares and Class B ordinary shares in the capital of the Company to Hitachi in exchange, on a one-for one basis, for the issued and outstanding preference shares Series A and Series C and ordinary shares Series B in the capital of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Netherlands B.V. held by Hitachi.
 
Issuance of Additional Class B Ordinary Share
In February 2011, in connection with becoming a public company in Singapore, the Company issued one additional Class B ordinary share to Hitachi.
Conversion and Redesignation of Shares
In February 2011, in connection with becoming a public company under Singapore law, the Company converted and redesignated its Class A and Class C preference shares and its Class B and Class D ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, in a one-for-one exchange for Ordinary shares.

Exhibit 99.5
Introduction
On March 8, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), Western Digital Corporation ("the Company" or "WDC"), through Western Digital Ireland ("WDI"), its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of Viviti Technologies Ltd., until recently known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. ("HGST"), from Hitachi Ltd. ("Hitachi"), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 7, 2011 ("SPA"). HGST is a developer and manufacturer of storage devices. As a result of the Acquisition, HGST became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The preliminary, aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition was approximately $4.7 billion, which was paid on the Closing Date and funded with $3.7 billion of existing cash and cash from new debt, as well as 25 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $877 million. The cash portion of the purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment (an increase or a decrease) that has not been determined for changes in the working capital of HGST, outstanding debt of HGST and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and certain other payments and expenses. The purchase price consideration included preliminary estimates of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and therefore, may be adjusted when finalized.
In connection with the regulatory approval process for the Acquisition, the Company announced on February 28, 2012 that it had reached an agreement with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba"), subject to regulatory approval, to divest certain assets related to the production of 3.5-inch hard drives to address the requirements of regulatory agencies that had conditionally approved the Acquisition. In addition, subject to completion of the divestiture transaction, the Company agreed to the purchase of Toshiba Storage Device (Thailand) Company Limited ("TSDT") by WDI. The net assets of TSDT consist primarily of real estate and receivables. The divestiture transaction and the acquisition of TSDT are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. This divestiture transaction has received all required regulatory approvals and must be completed within the time periods agreed upon with the jurisdictions whose approval of the Acquisition was conditioned on the divestiture, subject to any extensions that are obtained. This divestiture transaction is reflected in the pro forma adjustments below. The anticipated purchase of TSDT did not have an impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
In addition, in connection with the regulatory approval process for the Acquisition, the Company agreed to certain conditions required by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China ("MOFCOM"), including adopting measures to maintain HGST as a competitor until MOFCOM agrees otherwise (with the minimum period being two years). The Company is working closely with MOFCOM to finalize an operations plan that is expected to outline in more detail the conditions of this requirement.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of WDC and HGST after giving effect to the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and the divestiture of certain assets to Toshiba by applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2011 and for the nine months ended March 30, 2012 are presented as if the Acquisition and divestiture transaction had closed on July 3, 2010. You should read this information in conjunction with the following:
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Acquisition and related divestiture transaction had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include the effects of any nonrecurring charges and related tax effects that resulted from the Acquisition but will be included within income during the twelve months following the Closing Date.
The Company identified and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately $1.7 billion to goodwill. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on information available as of the date of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, and may be adjusted as further information becomes available during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of the Acquisition. Additional information that may become available and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but is not limited to, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations, the amounts required to settle them, the progress or outcomes of various litigation, pension plans and income taxes. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in material adjustments to goodwill.
WDC and HGST have different fiscal year ends. WDC's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to June 30 and HGST's fiscal year ends on December 31. As such, HGST's historical results have been recast to more closely conform to the periods presented for WDC, including the twelve months ended July 1, 2011 and the period from July 2, 2011 through the Closing Date.

1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
On March 8, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of HGST from Hitachi. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of WDC and HGST after giving effect to the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and the divestiture of certain assets to Toshiba by applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2011 and for the nine months ended March 30, 2012 are presented as if the Acquisition and divestiture transaction had closed on July 3, 2010.
Regulatory Conditions
In connection with the regulatory approval process for the Acquisition, the Company announced on February 28, 2012 that it had reached an agreement with Toshiba to, subject to regulatory approval, divest certain assets related to the production of 3.5-inch hard drives to address the requirements of regulatory agencies that had conditionally approved the Acquisition. In addition, subject to completion of the divestiture transaction, the Company agreed to purchase Toshiba Storage Device (Thailand) Company Limited ("TSDT"). The net assets of TSDT consist primarily of real estate and receivables. The divestiture transaction and the acquisition of TSDT are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. This divestiture transaction has received all required regulatory approvals. The divestiture transaction is reflected in pro forma condensed combined financial information. The anticipated purchase of TSDT did not have an impact of the pro forma financial statements.
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The preliminary aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition was approximately $4.7 billion, which was paid on the Closing Date and funded with $3.7 billion of existing cash and cash from new debt, as well as 25 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $877 million. The fair value of the newly issued shares of the Company's common stock was determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares of common stock on the date of Acquisition, less a 10% discount for lack of marketability as the shares issued are subject to a restriction that limits their trade or transfer for one year from the Closing Date.
The total preliminary purchase price for HGST was approximately $4.7 billion and was comprised of:
 
The preliminary fair values of stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") assumed were estimated using a binomial option-pricing model. See the "Stock-Based Compensation" section below in this Note 1 for a further discussion on stock awards assumed as a result of the Acquisition.
 
The Company identified and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately $1.7 billion to goodwill. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on information available as of the date of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, and may be adjusted as further information becomes available during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of the Acquisition. Additional information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but is not limited to, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations, the amounts required to settle them, the progress or outcomes of various litigation, pension plans and the income taxes. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in material adjustments to goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation was as follows (in millions):
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
The property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the Acquisition were valued using either the replacement cost or market value approach, as appropriate, as of the Closing Date. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment acquired from HGST and their estimated useful lives:
 
Inventories
The Company acquired $723 million of inventories as a result of the Acquisition. Finished goods were valued at estimated selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work-in-process inventory was valued at estimated selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the completion and selling effort, or at estimated replacement costs for certain components. Raw materials were valued at estimated replacement costs.
Warranty
The product warranty obligation assumed as a result of Acquisition was recognized at its estimated fair value of $139 million.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
In connection with the Acquisition, each outstanding HGST option, cash-settled SAR and restricted stock unit award ("RSU") that was unvested as of the Closing Date was converted into equivalent options, SARs and RSUs, with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio in accordance with the SPA. All awards will be recognized by the Company over the remaining service periods. Future expense for the converted HGST unvested options, SARs and RSUs will be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately 2.1 years.
Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values and estimated useful lives of the intangibles acquired from HGST:
 
The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired from HGST were estimated using an income approach. The fair value of the intangible assets will be amortized to cost of revenue over their weighted average useful lives, with the exception of intangible assets related to customer relationships and acquired in-process research and development projects. Customer relationship intangible assets will be amortized to operating expense over their weighted average useful lives. HGST had in-process research and development projects associated with areal density improvements that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the Closing Date. These projects are expected to incorporate significant changes in the magnetic structure of the media to achieve higher recording density for the Company. Accordingly, the Company recorded intangible assets of $140 million for the fair value of these projects, which will not initially be amortized. Instead, the projects will be tested on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the projects may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once a project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.
Adverse/Favorable Leasehold Interests
The Company analyzed the contractual facility leases assumed as part of the Acquisition to determine the fair value of the leasehold interests. An adverse leasehold position exists when the present value of the contractual rental obligation is greater than the present value of the market rental obligation, and conversely for a favorable leasehold interest. The Company recorded a net favorable leasehold interest of $12 million, which is classified within intangible assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation table above in this Note 1. The $12 million will be amortized to cost of revenue over the average lease term of five years.
Goodwill
The $1.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory conditions imposed on the Acquisition, the Company expects to derive from a more efficient and innovative customer-focused storage company with significant operating scale, strong global talent and a broad product lineup backed by a rich technology portfolio. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 
The Company is currently assessing the number of reporting units under which goodwill will be allocated and tested for impairment.
Debt
On the Closing Date, the Company, in its capacity as the parent entity and guarantor, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. ("WDT") and WDI, entered into a five-year credit agreement ("the Credit Facility") that provides for $2.8 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a $2.3 billion term loan facility and a $500 million revolving credit facility. The only borrower under the term loan facility is WDI and the revolving credit facility is available to both WDI and WDT (WDI and WDT are referred to as "the Borrowers"). The $2.3 billion term loan and $500 million available under the revolving credit facility were borrowed by WDI on the Closing Date and were used together with additional cash and 25 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock to fund the Acquisition, to repay the existing term loans of WDT, to repay the debt assumed with the Acquisition and to pay related fees, costs and expenses.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the applicable Borrower, either (a) a LIBOR rate determined by the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to certain exceptions (the "Eurodollar Rate") or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00% (the "Base Rate"), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 1.50% to 2.50% with respect to borrowings at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.50% to 1.50% with respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis. The interest rate at March 30, 2012 was 2.24%. A one-eighth percentage point change in the interest rate would result in an adjustment to pre-tax income of $4 million annually.
The Company was required to pay a commitment fee at the rate of 0.35%, per annum, of the aggregate unfunded amount committed to be borrowed under the Credit Facility from the date of commitment on March 7, 2011 through the Closing Date.

("Hitachi"), entered into in connection with the Companys acquisition of Viviti Technologies Ltd. (formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies), a subsidiary of Hitachi (the "Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Hitachi exercised its right to designate two individuals, the Hitachi Directors, to serve on the Board of Directors (the "Hitachi Board Nomination Right"). The Hitachi Board Nomination Right will terminate (i) with respect to one of the Hitachi Directors, on December 31, 2014, (ii) in the event that Hitachi ceases to own beneficially at least 50% of the shares of the Companys common stock Hitachi received as partial consideration in the Acquisition (the "Company Stock"), (iii) if Hitachi has first sold at least 10% of the shares of Company Stock, in the event that Hitachi ceases to beneficially own at least 5% of the Companys total issued and outstanding common stock, (iv) upon Hitachis breach of the standstill or transfer restriction obligations of the Investor Rights Agreement, or (v) upon Hitachis material breach of that certain Agreement Not to Compete entered into between the Company and Hitachi in connection with the Acquisition.

Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the Board of Directors, the Hitachi Directors will not serve on any committee of the Board of Directors. Neither Mr. Yamamura nor Mr. Oka has any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. In accordance with the Companys customary practice, the Company is entering into its standard form of indemnity agreement with each Hitachi Director, which requires the Company to indemnify the director against certain liabilities that may arise as a result of his status or service as a director. The indemnification protection commences on the date of the agreement and continues through the later of ten years after the directors termination of service or one year after the final termination of any Proceeding (as defined in the agreement) then pending in which the director is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of expenses or any Proceeding commenced by the director seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the form of Indemnity Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.13 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended July 1, 2011, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2011.

A copy of Western Digital's Investor Information Summary for the fourth quarter ended June 29, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In Western Digital's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, Western Digital reports certain financial information, including net income and earnings per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 29, 2012. These non-GAAP measures exclude expenses related to Western Digital's acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies; costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written-up to fair value and amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition; expenses related to the flooding in Thailand; litigation accruals; restructuring charges; and tax effects related to the aforementioned items. Because management believes these expenses and gains may not be indicative of ongoing operations, management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors as an alternative method for measuring Western Digital's operating performance and comparing it against prior periods' performance.

(e) On August 15, 2012, the Compensation Committee established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning June 30, 2012 and ending January 1, 2013. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning June 30, 2012 and ending January 1, 2013, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal for each of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, and selected operating income as the financial performance goal for the Companys other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee then established the specific earnings per share and operating income goals, as applicable, that correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 85% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the applicable pre-established goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executives individual and business groups performance.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
RETIREMENT OF JOHN COYNE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER On September 10, 2012, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced that John F. Coyne has decided, after serving in the position for more than five years, to retire as Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company on January 2, 2013. APPOINTMENT OF STEPHEN MILLIGAN AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Effective January 2, 2013, Stephen D. Milligan, age 49, currently the Companys President, will become the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer. At that time, he will also be made a member of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. In connection with Mr. Milligans appointment, the Company and Mr. Milligan entered into an amendment and restatement of Mr. Milligans existing employment agreement (the "Milligan Employment Agreement"). Under the Milligan Employment Agreement, Mr. Milligan is entitled to an annual base salary of $1 million effective January 2, 2013, and he will have an annual target bonus under the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan ("ICP") equal to 150% of his base salary effective with the performance period under the ICP covering the second half of fiscal 2013. Mr. Milligan also continues to participate as a "Tier I" participant in the Companys Executive Severance Plan and in the Companys Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan. Mr. Milligans annual long-term incentive awards for fiscal 2013 were also granted on September 6, 2012 in connection with the amendment and restatement of his employment agreement. These awards consist of the following:  83,652 performance shares covering performance over a cumulative two-year period consisting of fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The performance metrics for these performance shares are to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee").  41,826 restricted stock units vesting, subject to Mr. Milligans continued employment, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.  98,618 stock options with a per-share exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the Companys common stock on the grant date and a maximum term of seven years. The stock options are scheduled to vest, subject to Mr. Milligans continued employment, 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% at the end of each three-month period thereafter until the stock option is fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. In May 2012, Mr. Milligan was granted a performance-based stock unit award with a "target" payout of 50,050 shares of Company common stock, with 50% of the award subject to performance metrics to be established by the Compensation Committee with respect to fiscal 2013 and 50% of the award subject to performance metrics to be established by the Compensation Committee with respect to fiscal 2014, and the actual number of shares payable with respect to the award to range from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on actual performance over those two fiscal years. The Milligan Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Milligan will be granted an additional performance-based stock unit award at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee after January 2, 2013. The target number of shares subject to the award will be determined by the Compensation Committee at that time so that the target number of shares subject to the award on the grant date will have a value of $2 million. The award will otherwise be on the same terms and conditions as Mr. Milligans May 2012 performance-based stock unit award. Mr. Milligan re-joined us in March 2012 as President of the Company as a result of the Companys acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies ("HGST"). He served as HGSTs President from March 2009 to December 2009 and as its President and Chief Executive Officer from December 2009 until the Companys acquisition of HGST in March 2012. From September 2007 to October 2009, Mr. Milligan served as HGSTs Chief Financial Officer. From January 2004 to September 2007, Mr. Milligan served as the Companys Chief Financial Officer, and from September 2002 to January 2004 as the Companys Senior Vice President, Finance. From April 1997 to September 2002, Mr. Milligan held various financial and accounting roles of increasing responsibility at Dell Inc. Prior to joining Dell, Mr. Milligan was employed at Price Waterhouse for 12 years, most recently as Senior Manager. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Milligan and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Milligan was appointed to serve as the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer or as a member of the Board. There are no family relationships between Mr. Milligan and any director or executive officer of the Company, and he has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC) today announced that Steve Milligan will become chief executive officer of the company on January 2, 2013, succeeding John Coyne, who is retiring on that same date. Milligan, 49, is currently president of Western Digital and will retain the title of president when he becomes CEO. Following Coyne's retirement, Milligan will be appointed to the Western Digital board of directors.
IRVINE, CASept. 10, 2012
"We are grateful to John Coyne for his many years of dedication and strong leadership," said Tom Pardun, chairman of the board. "He and his team have strategically positioned the company at the center of the storage industry, as a consistently profitable market and technology leader well positioned to address the tremendous opportunities in the changing digital world.
"We are fortunate to have another accomplished and experienced leader in Steve Milligan, ready to lead the company at this exciting time," continued Pardun. "We believe Steve's vision and demonstrated leadership skills will serve our customers, employees and shareholders well in the years ahead. The strong working relationship between John and Steve will provide for an orderly transition in the months ahead."
Coyne, 63, has served as CEO of Western Digital since January 2007 and spent the vast majority of a distinguished career in the electronics industry with Western Digital, joining the company in 1983. Under his leadership, Western Digital became the world's largest maker of hard drives, through a relentless focus on the quality and reliability of its products, product portfolio expansion to capture evolving market trends, efficiency in its manufacturing operations and asset management, and excellence in its customer and supply chain relationships. In the last six years, WDC has grown its revenue three fold, been consistently profitable, generated significant cash and completed several successful strategic transactions including the recent acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), formerly the hard drive division of Hitachi Ltd.
Milligan rejoined Western Digital earlier this year as president as a result of the HGST acquisition. He had served as HGST's president from March 2009 to December 2009 and as its president and chief executive officer from December 2009 until WDC's acquisition of HGST in March 2012. From 2007 to 2009, he served as HGST's chief financial officer. From 2004 to 2007, Milligan served as chief financial officer of Western Digital. Previously, he held a variety of financial and accounting roles at Dell and Price Waterhouse.
Under his leadership, HGST initiated a significant transformation of its business to focus on market-driven leadership, sustainable growth, operational excellence, and financial discipline. These initiatives helped HGST significantly improve its operational performance and achieve consistent profitability prior to its acquisition by Western Digital.
Before launching his career in business, Milligan was a long time resident of Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from the Ohio State University.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
ADOPTION OF CAPITAL ALLOCATION PLAN On September 13, 2012, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced that the Board of Directors (the "Board") has approved a capital allocation plan pursuant to which it has authorized (i) an additional $1.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and (ii) the adoption of a dividend policy (the "Dividend Policy") under which the Company intends to pay a quarterly cash dividend on its Common Stock beginning in the first quarter of its current fiscal year. Pursuant to the Dividend Policy, on September 13, 2012, directors declared the first cash dividend for the quarter ending September 28, 2012 of $0.25 per share of Common Stock (the "Cash Dividend"). The Cash Dividend will be paid on October 15, 2012 to the Companys stockholders of record as of September 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Companys share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of its Common Stock from time to time, in amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate, subject to market conditions. The Company may make repurchases in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, or in privately negotiated transactions, and any repurchase may be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchases of Common Stock pursuant to the Boards additional $1.5 billion authorization must be made by September 13, 2017. The amount and timing of repurchases of Common Stock under the Companys share repurchase program as well as the amount of future dividends under the Dividend Policy, and the declaration and payment thereof, will be based upon all relevant factors, including the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and restrictions under the Companys existing credit agreement, and shall be in compliance with applicable law. The Board retains the power to modify, suspend or cancel the Companys share repurchase program or the Dividend Policy in any manner and at any time as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the future. SEPTEMBER QUARTER UPDATE On September 13, 2012, the Company also announced that revenue for the quarter ending September 28, 2012 would be lower than originally forecasted due to muted demand and inventory rebalancing. The Company now expects the industrys total available market for hard drives in the September quarter to be approximately 140 million units versus its earlier forecast of 157 million units. As a result, the Company now expects September quarter revenue to be approximately $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion, compared to the previous expectation of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. The Company continues to estimate its gross margin for the September quarter to be approximately 30 percent on a non-GAAP basis. The Company also reiterated its non-GAAP earnings per share target of $10 for the fiscal year ending June 28, 2013. The press release making these announcements is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits 99.1 Press Release issued by Western Digital Corporation on September 13, 2012 announcing a capital allocation plan and providing updated guidance for the September quarter of fiscal 2013.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Companys capital allocation plans, the total available market for hard drives in the September quarter, and the Companys financial performance expectations for the September quarter and fiscal year 2013, including its market share, revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. These forward-looking statements are based on managements current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including the impact of continued uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions; supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; uncertainties concerning the availability and cost of commodity materials and specialized product components; actions by competitors; unexpected advances in competing technologies; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and expansion into new data storage markets; business conditions and growth in the various hard drive markets; pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including the Companys recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2012, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition, this Form 8-K contains references to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. The forward-looking non-GAAP financial guidance provided in this Form 8-K excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the dilutive impact of sales of hard drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction. Because the amount of these items cannot be forecasted with certainty or accuracy based on information known to the Company at this time, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The impact of these excluded items may cause non-GAAP gross margin and earnings per share to differ materially from gross margin and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On October 12, 2012, the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota (the "Court") vacated, in full, the $630.4 million final arbitration award previously issued against Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") in the arbitration between the Company and Seagate Technology, LLC ("Seagate") that concluded on January 23, 2012. In the arbitration, Seagate alleged, among other things, misappropriation of eight alleged trade secrets by the Company and a now former employee. The Court confirmed the arbitration award with respect to each of the five trade secret claims that Western Digital and the former employee had won at the arbitration, and vacated the arbitration award with respect to the three trade secret claims that Western Digital and the former employee had lost. The Court ordered that a rehearing be held concerning those three alleged trade secrets before a new arbitrator agreed upon by the parties and that if by November 2, 2012 the parties are unable to reach agreement, then the Court will appoint a new arbitrator.

(e) The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") previously adopted an amendment and restatement of the Western Digital Corporation Amended and Restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Restated Plan"), subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. Among other things, the Restated Plan reflects amendments to (i) increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for award grants under the Restated Plan by 11,500,000 shares; (ii) increase the ratio in respect of which any "full-value awards" (such as restricted stock units) will count against the share limit of the Restated Plan from 1.35 to 1.72 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award; (iii) extend the Company's authority to grant awards under the Restated Plan intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the Company's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders; (iv) to approve the performance criteria listed in Section 5.2.2 of the Restated Plan for use in connection with such performance-based awards and (v) to extend the expiration date of the Restated Plan to August 6, 2022. According to the results from the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on November 8, 2012, the Company's stockholders have approved the Restated Plan.
The following summary of the Restated Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by this reference.
The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the Restated Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the Restated Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board. The administrator of the Restated Plan has broad authority under the plan to, among other things, select participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
Persons eligible to receive awards under the Restated Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the Restated Plan equals the sum of: (1) 48,835,048 shares, plus (2) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted and outstanding as of November 8, 2012 under the Company's Employee Stock Option Plan, Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors or Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised.
Shares issued in respect of any "full-value award" granted under the Restated Plan will be counted against the share limit described in the preceding paragraph as 1.72 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award. For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of the Company's common stock were granted under the Restated Plan, 172 shares would be charged against the share limit with respect to that stock bonus award. For this purpose, a "full-value award" generally means any award granted under the plan other than a stock option or stock appreciation right.
 
To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Restated Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any award under the Restated Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award, will not be available for subsequent awards under the Restated Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right, only the actual number of shares delivered with respect to the award will be counted against the share limits of the Restated Plan. To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the share limits of the Restated Plan, as opposed to only counting the shares actually issued. Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the Restated Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the Restated Plan.
The types of awards that may be granted under the Restated Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common stock or units of the Company's common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the Restated Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase price of awards, and the performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.

An is any person who is either: (a) an officer (whether or not a director) or employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries; (b) a director of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries; or (c) an individual consultant or advisor who renders or has rendered bona fide services (other than services in connection with the offering or sale of securities of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries in a capital-raising transaction or as a market maker or promoter of securities of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries) to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and who is selected to participate in this Plan by the Administrator; provided, however, that a person who is otherwise an Eligible Person under clause (c) above may participate in this Plan only if such participation would not adversely affect either the Corporation's eligibility to use Form S-8 to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ), the offering and sale of shares issuable under this Plan by the Corporation or the Corporation's compliance with any other applicable laws. An Eligible Person who has been granted an award (a "participant") may, if otherwise eligible, be granted additional awards if the Administrator shall so determine.

With respect to awards intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), this Plan shall be administered by a committee consisting solely of two or more outside directors (as this requirement is applied under Section 162(m) of the Code); provided, however, that the failure to satisfy such requirement shall not affect the validity of the action of any committee otherwise duly authorized and acting in the matter. Award grants to, and transactions in or involving awards held by persons who the Board or a committee thereof determines are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), must be duly and timely authorized by a Board committee consisting solely of two or more non-employee directors (as this requirement is applied under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

Notwithstanding the foregoing and except for an adjustment pursuant to Section 7.1 or a repricing approved by stockholders, in no case may the Administrator (1) amend an outstanding stock option or SAR to reduce the exercise price or base price of the award, (2) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or SAR in exchange for cash or other awards for the purpose of repricing the award, or (3) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or SAR in exchange for an option or SAR with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise or base price of the original award.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided that in no event shall the Share Limit exceed 74,349,531 shares (which is the sum of the 43,500,000 shares set forth above, plus the number of shares available under the Option Plans for additional award grant purposes as of the Effective Date (as such term is defined in Section 8.6.1), plus the aggregate number of shares subject to options previously granted and outstanding under the Option Plans as of the Effective Date, plus the maximum number of shares subject to restricted stock awards previously granted and outstanding under the Broad-Based Plan that had not vested as of the Effective Date), plus the maximum number of shares that will become available as a result of the expiration of the Stock-For-Fees Plan.
Shares issued in respect of any "Full-Value Award" granted under this Plan shall be counted against the foregoing Share Limit as 1.72 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. (For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of Common Stock is granted under this Plan, 172 shares shall be charged against the Share Limit in connection with that award.) For this purpose, a "" means any award under this Plan that is a stock option grant or a stock appreciation right grant.
Full-Value Award
not
 
The following limits also apply with respect to awards granted under this Plan:
 
 
 
 
Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
. A stock option is the grant of a right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock during a specified period as determined by the Administrator. An option may be intended as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an "ISO") or a nonqualified stock option (an option not intended to be an ISO). The award agreement for an option will indicate if the option is intended as an ISO; otherwise it will be deemed to be a nonqualified stock option. The maximum term of each option (ISO or nonqualified) shall be ten (10) years. The per share exercise price for each option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the option. When an option is exercised, the exercise price for the shares to be purchased shall be paid in full in cash or such other method permitted by the Administrator consistent with Section 5.5.
5.1.1
Stock Options
 
. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant of the applicable option) of stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to ISOs under this Plan and stock subject to ISOs under all other plans of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (or any parent or predecessor corporation to the extent required by and within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options. In reducing the number of options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Administrator may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (for this purpose, the term "subsidiary" is used as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, which generally requires an unbroken chain of ownership of at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of each subsidiary in the chain beginning with the Corporation and ending with the subsidiary in question). There shall be imposed in any award agreement relating to ISOs such other terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the option be an "incentive stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such option is granted.
5.1.2
Additional Rules Applicable to ISOs
. A stock appreciation right or "" is a right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Stock, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the SAR was granted (the "base price") as set forth in the applicable award agreement. The maximum term of an SAR shall be ten (10) years.
5.1.3
Stock Appreciation Rights
SAR
. The other types of awards that may be granted under this Plan include: (a) stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, whether at a fixed or variable price or ratio related to the Common Stock, upon the passage of time, the occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance criteria or other conditions, or any combination thereof; (b) any similar securities with a value derived from the value of or related to the Common Stock and/or returns thereon; or (c) cash awards. Dividend equivalent rights may be granted as a separate award or in connection with another award under this Plan; provided, however, that dividend equivalent rights may not be granted in connection with a stock option or SAR granted under this Plan. In addition, any dividends and/or dividend equivalents as to the unvested portion of a restricted stock award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements or the unvested portion of a stock unit award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements will be subject to termination and forfeiture to the same extent as the corresponding portion of the award to which they relate.
5.1.4
Other Awards
 
. Except for any accelerated vesting required or permitted pursuant to Section 7 and except as otherwise provided in the following provisions of this Section 5.1.5, and subject to such additional vesting requirements or conditions as the Administrator may establish with respect to the award, each award granted under this Plan that is a Full-Value Award and payable in shares of Common Stock shall be subject to the following minimum vesting requirements: (a) if the award includes a performance-based vesting condition, the award shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant of the award and vesting shall occur only if the award holder is employed by, a director of, or otherwise providing services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on such vesting date; and (b) if the award does not include a performance-based vesting condition, the award shall not vest more rapidly than in monthly installments over the three-year period immediately following the date of grant of the award and vesting of any vesting installment of the award shall occur only if the award holder is employed by, a director of, or otherwise providing services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on the date such installment is scheduled to vest; provided that the Administrator may accelerate or provide in the applicable award agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Full-Value Award in connection with a change in control of the award holder's employer (or a parent thereof), the termination of the award holder's employment (including a termination of employment due to the award holder's death, disability or retirement, but not including a termination of employment by the award holder's employer for cause), or as consideration or partial consideration for a release by the award holder of pending or threatened claims against the Company, the award holder's employer, or any of their respective officers, directors or other affiliates (regardless of whether the release is given in connection with a termination of employment by the award holder's employer for cause or other circumstances). The Administrator may, however, accelerate or provide in the applicable award agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Full-Value Award in circumstances not contemplated by the preceding sentence, and/or provide for a vesting schedule that is shorter than the minimum schedule contemplated by the preceding sentence, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the portion of any such Full-Value Award that vests earlier than the minimum vesting dates that would be applicable pursuant to the minimum vesting requirements of the preceding sentence (or, as to any accelerated vesting, provides for accelerated vesting other than in the circumstances contemplated by the preceding sentence) shall count against the applicable share limits of Section 4.2 as a Special Full-Value Award (as opposed to counting against such limits only as a Full-Value Award).
5.1.5
Minimum Vesting Requirements
 
The eligible class of persons for Performance-Based Awards under this Section 5.2 shall be officers and employees of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries.

Where applicable, these terms are used as applied under generally accepted accounting principles or in the financial reporting of the Corporation or of its Subsidiaries. To qualify awards as performance-based under Section 162(m), the applicable Business Criterion (or Business Criteria, as the case may be) and specific performance goal or goals ("targets") must be established and approved by the Administrator during the first 90 days of the performance period (and, in the case of performance periods of less than one year, in no event after 25% or more of the performance period has elapsed) and while performance relating to such target(s) remains substantially uncertain within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. Performance targets shall be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other extraordinary events not foreseen at the time the targets were set unless the Administrator provides otherwise at the time of establishing the targets. The applicable performance measurement period may not be less than three months nor more than 10 years.
5.2.2
Performance Goals

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be delivered pursuant to Performance-Based Awards (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs, and other than cash awards covered by the following sentence) that are granted to any one participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed 800,000 shares, either individually or in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of all Performance-Based Awards payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed $10,000,000. Awards that are cancelled during the year shall be counted against these limits to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code.
5.2.3
Form of Payment; Maximum Performance-Based Award
.
Before any Performance-Based Award under this Section 5.2 (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) is paid and to the extent required to qualify the award as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator must certify in writing that the performance target(s) and any other material terms of the Performance-Based Award were in fact timely satisfied.
5.2.4
Certification of Payment
.
The Administrator will have the discretion to determine the restrictions or other limitations of the individual awards granted under this Section 5.2 including the authority to reduce awards, payouts or vesting or to pay no awards, in its sole discretion, if the Administrator preserves such authority at the time of grant by language to this effect in its authorizing resolutions or otherwise.
5.2.5
Reservation of Discretion
.
As required pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Administrator's authority to grant new awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) shall terminate upon the first meeting of the Corporation's stockholders that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the Corporation's stockholders approve this restatement of the Plan, subject to any subsequent extension that may be approved by stockholders.
5.2.6
Expiration of Grant Authority
.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In no event shall any shares newly-issued by the Corporation be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration for such shares or for consideration other than consideration permitted by applicable state law. Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an option shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise. The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation.
 
 
. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 5.7, by applicable law and by the award agreement, as the same may be amended, (a) all awards are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (b) awards shall be exercised only by the participant; and (c) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to any award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the participant.
5.7.1
Limitations on Exercise and Transfer
 
. The Administrator may permit awards to be transferred to other persons or entities pursuant to such conditions and procedures, including limitations on subsequent transfers, as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, establish in writing; provided, however, that any such transfer shall only be permitted if it is made by the participant for estate or tax planning or charitable purposes for no (or nominal) consideration, as determined by the Administrator. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
5.7.2
Exceptions
. The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 5.7.1 shall not apply to:
5.7.3
Further Exceptions to Limits on Transfer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation as an entirety, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust the performance standards applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based awards.
 
It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable U.S. legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 7.1, and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
 
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator pursuant to its authority under this Section 7.2 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) require or grant (either at the time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, that the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law. The Corporation may, with the Administrator's approval, accept one or more promissory notes from any Eligible Person in connection with taxes required to be withheld upon the exercise, vesting or payment of any award under this Plan; provided that any such note shall be subject to terms and conditions established by the Administrator and the requirements of applicable law.
 
. This Plan is effective as of September 21, 2004, the date of its approval by the Board (the ""). Unless earlier terminated by the Board, this Plan shall terminate at the close of business on August 6, 2022. After the termination of this Plan either upon such stated expiration date or its earlier termination by the Board, no additional awards may be granted under this Plan, but previously granted awards (and the authority of the Administrator with respect thereto, including the authority to amend such awards) shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of this Plan.

Any amendment or other action that would constitute a repricing of an award is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.2.

Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 7 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 8.6 and shall not require stockholder approval or the consent of the award holder.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On January 23, 2013, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") communicated to U.S.-based employees of its WD subsidiary that it was instituting a voluntary separation program (the "Program") intended to help realign its cost structure with a softer demand environment. Employees who apply for and are accepted in the Program will receive enhanced separation benefits based on job level and, in some cases, length of service. Executive officers of the Company are not eligible for the Program. The Company currently does not know the number or job levels of employees that will participate in the Program. Therefore, at this time the Company is unable to estimate the charges it will incur in connection with the Program, although it expects charges will consist of cash severance and other one-time termination benefits. The Company expects to complete the Program by the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and will provide an estimate of the amount or range of charges expected to be incurred when a good faith determination can be made.

As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 21, 2012, each of the executive officers of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") is eligible to receive a bonus award under the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% of the executives target bonus opportunity for the six-month period ended December 28, 2012 based upon the Companys performance during such period as measured against pre-established earnings per share goals (for Messrs. Milligan and Nickl, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively) or operating income goals (for Messrs. Leyden and Cordano, the Companys other executive officers), and subject to upward or downward adjustment in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") depending upon the executives individual and business groups performance.

In recognition of the Companys performance, including relative to its competitors, under difficult market conditions and the achievement of certain key initiatives to improve operating costs and streamline product focus, the Compensation Committee, in addition to the bonus payable as a result of achievement of the ICP performance goals, approved an additional amount payable to each current executive officer as follows: Mr. Milligan - $125,000, Mr. Nickl - $47,813, Mr. Leyden - $96,250, and Mr. Cordano - $82,500.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 14, 2013, the Compensation Committee established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning December 29, 2012 and ending June 28, 2013. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning December 29, 2012 and ending June 28, 2013, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal for each of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and selected operating income as the financial performance goal for the Companys other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee then established the specific earnings per share and operating income goals, as applicable, that correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 85% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the applicable pre-established goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executives individual and business groups performance.

Preliminary Note: This Form 8-K/A amends and updates the disclosures made in the Form 8-K filed by Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") on January 23, 2013. On January 23, 2013, the Company filed a Form 8-K to disclose that it was instituting a voluntary separation program (the "Program") intended to help realign its cost structure with prevailing market needs. At that time, the Company was unable to estimate the pre-tax cash and non-cash charges and total charges it expected to incur in connection with this action. The Company now estimates that it will incur pre-tax charges of approximately $55 million related to cash severance and other termination benefits in connection with the Program. The Company expects to recognize substantially all of these charges by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Approximately $52 million of these charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures.
