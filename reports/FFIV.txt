FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks Announces Second Quarter Earnings
Revenue up sequentially on demand for new products and strengthening international sales
F5 Networks today announced net income of $815,000 ($0.03 per share) on revenue of $28.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Both results were within the target ranges ($0.02 to $0.04 on revenue of $27 million to $28.5 million) set by management in the company's January 22 earnings release. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the company reported a net loss of $1.8 million ($0.07 per share) on revenue of $27.1 million.
SEATTLE, WAApril 23, 2003
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's sequential revenue growth reflected strong demand for the company's recently introduced family of new products, which helped drive application switch sales to 67 percent of systems revenue, up from 54 percent in the prior quarter. In addition, McAdam said the company saw solid improvements in all of its international markets, which accounted for more than 37 percent of total revenue for the quarter.
"During the second quarter, sales of the new switch-based products we began shipping in December continued to accelerate in response to strong demand from both new customers and our installed base," McAdam said. "Interest in these products reflects their superior performance and the advanced functionality of our BIG-IP Application Traffic Management software, which can identify any set of values in a stream of packets and use those values to direct, persist or filter traffic."
McAdam added that sales of BIG-IP software into the nascent blade server market also contributed to F5's revenue growth during the second quarter. "Although blade server sales have been slow to take off, we are beginning to see signs that the market is gaining momentum."
Near the end of the quarter, McAdam said, the company also began shipping its newest software product, iControl Services Manager (iSM), a comprehensive network management solution that improves the effectiveness of network infrastructure by providing centralized administration of F5 devices. "iSM allows our customers to install, configure and manage multiple F5 devices from a single console, making them easier to use and adding a new level of functionality. This is particularly attractive to our large enterprise customers who have dozens of BIG-IP appliances and application switches within a division or managing traffic for a single application." Although iSM is expected to
 
generate incremental software revenue, McAdam said its primary significance is that it leverages the company's iControl architecture to add value to F5's existing products.
Commenting on the relative strength of international revenue during the quarter, McAdam noted that sales in Japan benefited from seasonal strength accompanying the March close of the Japanese fiscal year. At the same time, he said, Europe and Asia-Pacific also posted solid gains that reflected the strength of the company's distribution partnerships. The combined growth in international sales more than offset the ongoing sluggishness in U.S. markets as war-related issues compounded other factors that have dampened the economy and continue to impede capital spending. McAdam said he did not expect the U.S. business climate to improve significantly over the next several months.
Despite the prospect of lingering softness in the U.S., McAdam said the overall outlook for F5 remains positive, and the company continues to see evidence that its initiatives in the emerging markets for blade servers, Web services and wireless Internet applications represent solid growth opportunities in the second half of calendar 2003.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2003, he said the company has set a target of $27.5 million to $29.0 million in revenue with net income of $0.02 to $0.04 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced net income of $1.4 million ($0.05 per share) on revenue of $29.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2003, up from $0.8 million ($0.03 per share) on revenue of $28.0 million in the prior quarter. Both results exceeded the target ranges ($0.02 to $0.04 per share on revenue of $27.5 million to $29.0 million) set by management in the company's April 23rd earnings release. In the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the company reported revenue of $27.1 million and a net loss of $4.3 million ($0.17 per share), including non-recurring expenses related to the discontinuation of its EDGE-FX cache business and the consolidation of operations.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 23, 2003
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's sequential revenue growth resulted from strong sales in North America and Asia-Pacific, up sharply from the prior quarter. "The growth of sales in North America was stronger in the third quarter than we had anticipated, with product sales up 12 percent from the second quarter," McAdam said. "Internationally, sales in Asia-Pacific grew even faster, helping to offset seasonal slowness in Japan. From a product perspective, revenue increased sequentially across all product categories, with system sales representing 68 percent of total revenue and software sales accounting for 5 percent. We also saw sequential growth in service revenue, which represented 27 percent of total revenue."
According to McAdam, the growth of North American revenue was fueled primarily by increased channel sales and a number of large enterprise wins. "As we continued to forge new relationships with some of the region's largest resellers, we saw meaningful contributions from several of the new partners we signed up in prior quarters. In addition, we continued to build momentum in sales to global strategic accounts, which included four large wins totaling more than $2.5 million," McAdam said.
Operationally, the company turned in a solid performance, reflected in several key metrics. Gross margin and operating expenses for the quarter were within the company's target ranges. Days sales outstanding (DSO) fell to 63 days, and operating cash flow of $3.4 million helped boost cash, cash equivalents and investments to $96.8 million at June 30.
 
In a separate release issued today (http://www.f5.com/f5/news/press/), F5 also announced that it has acquired the assets of uRoam, Inc., a provider of Web-based remote access solutions, for $25 million in cash. Steve Coburn, F5's senior vice president of finance and CFO, said he expects early sales of uRoam's products in September but does not expect revenue from those sales to be material in the current quarter, ending September 30, 2003. For fiscal 2004, he said uRoam's products could generate revenue in the range of $8 million to $12 million.
Including the effect of the acquisition, F5 has set a fourth quarter revenue target of $29.5 million to $30.5 million with earnings of $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share.
Further details about third quarter results, the uRoam acquisition, and company guidance for the fourth quarter will be discussed in the company's regularly scheduled conference call today at 1:30 p.m. PDT. The call in numbers: 800-547-2439 (US & Canada) and 706-634-1209 (International). The conference ID is: 1222474.

If Buyer elects to have Seller continue its efforts to obtain any Material Consents and the Closing occurs, notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4, neither this Agreement nor the Bill of Sale nor any other document related to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Restricted Material Contracts, and following the Closing, the parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain the Material Consent relating to each Restricted Material Contract as quickly as practicable.

Once a Material Consent for the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Material Contract is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted Material Contract to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Restricted Material Contract assigned to Buyer from and after the date of assignment to Buyer pursuant to a special-purpose bill of sale or assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement (which special-purpose agreements the parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer, all at no additional cost to Buyer).

nor any other document related to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract, and (B) Seller shall retain such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract and all Liabilities arising therefrom or relating thereto.

Interjak Contracts shall be assigned to Buyer as set forth in Section 2.1.

After the Closing and until December 1, 2003, Seller will refer to Buyer all inquiries relating to such business.

The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations. 11.2 Indemnification and Reimbursement by Seller Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.5, and 11.7, Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, and its Representatives, shareholders, subsidiaries and Related Persons (collectively, the "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS"), and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any loss, liability, claim, damage, expense (including costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) or diminution of value, whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim (collectively, "DAMAGES"), arising from or in connection with: (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in (i) this Agreement, (ii) the Disclosure Letter, (iii) the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 2.7, (iv) any transfer instrument or (v) any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (b) any Breach of any covenant or obligation of Seller in this Agreement or in any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (c) any Liability arising out of the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time other than the Assumed Liabilities; (d) any brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been made, by any Person with Seller (or any Person acting on its behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions except as set forth in Section 13.1; (e) any noncompliance with any fraudulent transfer law in respect of the Contemplated Transactions; (f) any liability under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Legal Requirement that may result from an "Employment Loss", as defined by 29 U.S.C. sect. 2101(a)(6), caused by any action of Seller prior to the Closing or by Buyer's decision not to hire previous employees of Seller; 34
(g) any Employee Plan established or maintained by Seller; or (h) any Retained Liabilities. 11.3 [Reserved] 11.4 Indemnification and Reimbursement by Buyer Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.6, and 11.7, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and will reimburse Seller, for any Damages arising from or in connection with: (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; (b) any Breach of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement or in any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; (c) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by such Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on Buyer's behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions; or (d) any Assumed Liabilities. 11.5 Limitations On Amount of Liability -- Seller Seller shall have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to claims under Section 11.2(a) until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $100,000 (at which point Seller shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer from and against all Claims relating back to the first dollar). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the aggregate liability (for indemnification or otherwise) of Seller under this Agreement to Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not exceed $2,500,000 (the "LIABILITY LIMIT"). Any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) of Seller under this Agreement to Buyer Indemnified Persons that is within the Liability Limit shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive remedy for damages of Buyer Indemnified Persons under this Agreement. The maximum liability of any shareholder of Seller under this Agreement shall be limited to such shareholder's interest in the Escrow Fund. 11.6 Limitations on Amount of Liability -- Buyer Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to claims under Section 11.4(a) until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $100,000 (at which point buyer shall be obligated to indemnify Seller from and against all Claims relating back to the first dollar); provided, however, that Buyer's obligation under this Section 11.6 shall not exceed $2,500,000. 11.7 Time Limitations (a) If the Closing occurs, Seller will not have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) under this Agreement except to the extent Buyer notifies Seller on or before the 35
Remedy Termination Date of a claim specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer. (b) If the Closing occurs, Buyer will not have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) under this Agreement except to the extent Seller notifies Buyer on or before the Remedy Termination Date of a claim specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Seller. 11.8 Escrow The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. In the event that any Damages arise, the Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to the indemnification obligations of Seller set forth in Section 11.2. 11.9 Third-Party Claims (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 11.2 or 11.4 (an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice. (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 11.9(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person's Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will be 36
bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnified Person will not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Person's Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.4, Seller hereby consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any Buyer Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world. (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. (f) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege. 11.10 Other Claims A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 11.11 Escrow Period Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence until the Remedy Termination Date (the "Escrow Period"). Upon the expiration of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Fund shall terminate and any remaining funds shall be released to Seller; provided, however, that the amount of the Escrow Fund, which, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, subject to the objection of the Seller and the subsequent arbitration of the claim in the manner provided in the Escrow Agreement, are necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims with respect to which Buyer timely delivers notice to Seller pursuant to Section 11.7 shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) 37
until such claims have been resolved. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the escrow agent shall deliver to Seller all of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY 12.1 Definition of Confidential Information (a) As used in this Article 12, the term "Confidential Information" includes any and all of the following information of Seller or Buyer that has been or may hereafter be disclosed in any form, whether in writing, orally, electronically or otherwise, or otherwise made available by observation, inspection or otherwise by either party or its Representatives (collectively, a "DISCLOSING PARTY") to the other party or its Representatives (collectively, a "RECEIVING PARTY"): (i) all information that is a trade secret under applicable trade secret or other law; (ii) all information concerning product specifications, data, know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current and planned research and development, current and planned manufacturing or distribution methods and processes, customer lists, current and anticipated customer requirements, price lists, market studies, business plans, computer hardware, Software and computer software and database technologies, systems, structures and architectures; (iii) all information concerning the business and affairs of the Disclosing Party (which includes historical and current financial statements, financial projections and budgets, tax returns and accountants' materials, historical, current and projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans, business plans, strategic plans, marketing and advertising plans, publications, client and customer lists and files, contracts, the names and backgrounds of key personnel and personnel training techniques and materials, however documented), and all information obtained from review of the Disclosing Party's documents or property or discussions with the Disclosing Party regardless of the form of the communication; and (iv) all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other material prepared by the Receiving Party to the extent containing or based, in whole or in part, upon any information included in the foregoing. (b) Any trade secrets of a Disclosing Party shall also be entitled to all of the protections and benefits under applicable trade secret law and any other applicable law. If any information that a Disclosing Party deems to be a trade secret is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret for purposes of this Article 12, such information shall still be considered Confidential Information of that Disclosing Party for purposes of this Article 12 to the extent included within the definition. In the case of trade secrets, each of Buyer or Seller hereby waives any requirement that the other party submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other security. 12.2 Restricted Use of Confidential Information (a) Each Receiving Party acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and agrees that such Confidential 38
Information (i) shall be kept confidential by the Receiving Party; (ii) shall not be used for any reason or purpose other than to evaluate and consummate the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, shall not be disclosed by the Receiving Party to any Person, except in each case as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement or with the prior written consent of an authorized representative of Seller with respect to Confidential Information of Seller (each, a "SELLER CONTACT") or an authorized representative of Buyer with respect to Confidential Information of Buyer (each, a "BUYER CONTACT"). Each of Buyer and Seller shall disclose the Confidential Information of the other party only to its Representatives who require such material for the purpose of evaluating the Contemplated Transactions and are informed by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of the obligations of this Article 12 with respect to such information. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (iv) enforce the terms of this Article 12 as to its respective Representatives; (v) take such action to the extent necessary to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms and conditions of this Article 12; and (vi) be responsible and liable for any breach of the provisions of this Article 12 by it or its Representatives. (b) Unless and until this Agreement is terminated, Seller shall maintain as confidential any Confidential Information (including for this purpose any information of Seller of the type referred to in Sections 12.1(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), whether or not disclosed to Buyer) of the Seller relating to any of the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Seller may use any Confidential Information of Seller before the Closing in the Ordinary Course of Business in connection with the transactions permitted by Section 5.2. (c) From and after the Closing, the provisions of Section 12.2(a) above shall not apply to or restrict in any manner Buyer's use of any Confidential Information of the Seller relating to any of the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. 12.3 Exceptions (a) Sections 12.2(a) and (b) do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party that a Receiving Party demonstrates (a) was, is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Article 12 or the [Confidentiality Agreement] by the Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was or is developed by the Receiving Party independently of and without reference to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (c) was, is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a Third Party not bound by a confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other obligation restricting disclosure. Seller shall not disclose any Confidential Information of Seller relating to any of the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities in reliance on the exceptions in clauses (b) or (c) above. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, including Section 12.2 hereof, or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, the parties acknowledge and agree that any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein shall not apply to the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the date of the public announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) the Agreement Date, all within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4; provided, however, that each party recognizes that the privilege each has to maintain, in its sole discretion, the confidentiality of a communication relating to such transactions, including a confidential 39
communication with its attorney or a confidential communication with a federally authorized tax practitioner under Section 7525 of the Code, is not intended to be affected by the foregoing. 12.4 Legal Proceedings If a Receiving Party becomes compelled in any Proceeding or is requested by a Governmental Body having regulatory jurisdiction over the Contemplated Transactions to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Article 12, that Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such compulsion or request so that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Article 12. In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, the Receiving Party may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that, based upon advice of the Receiving Party's counsel, the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose or that has been requested by such Governmental Body, provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded by any Person to whom any Confidential Information is so disclosed. The provisions of this Section 12.4 do not apply to any Proceedings between the parties to this Agreement. 12.5 Return or Destruction of Confidential Information If this Agreement is terminated, each Receiving Party shall (a) destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party prepared or generated by the Receiving Party without retaining a copy of any such material; (b) promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party all other Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, together with all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the Receiving Party or, alternatively, with the written consent of a Seller Contact or a Buyer Contact (whichever represents the Disclosing Party) destroy all such Confidential Information; and (c) certify all such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party, provided, however, that the Receiving Party may retain a list that contains general descriptions of the information it has returned or destroyed to facilitate the resolution of any controversies after the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information is returned. 12.6 Attorney-Client Privilege The Disclosing Party is not waiving, and will not be deemed to have waived or diminished, any of its attorney work product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing its Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party, regardless of whether the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is or may be entitled to assert, such privileges and protections. The parties (a) share a common legal and commercial interest in all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that is subject to such privileges and protections; (b) are or may become joint defendants in Proceedings to which the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges relates; (c) intend that such privileges and protections remain intact should either party become subject to any actual or threatened Proceeding to which the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges relates; and (d) intend that after the Closing the Receiving Party shall have the right to assert such protections and privileges. No Receiving Party shall admit, claim or contend, in Proceedings involving either party or otherwise, that any Disclosing Party waived any of its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to any information, documents or other material not disclosed to a Receiving Party due to the Disclosing Party disclosing its Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party. 40

13.5 Waiver; Remedies Cumulative The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. 13.6 Entire Agreement and Modification This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to its subject matter (including any letter of intent and any confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Seller) and constitutes (along with the Disclosure Letter, Exhibits and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by a written agreement executed by uRoam and Buyer. 13.7 Disclosure Letter (a) The information in the Disclosure Letter constitutes (i) exceptions to particular representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller as set forth in this Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in this Agreement.

FOR $25 MILLION Acquisition of industry-leading SSL-VPN technology broadens the scope of the company's secure application traffic management solutions SEATTLE, JULY 23, 2003--F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), the leading provider of Application Traffic Management solutions, today announced that it has acquired the assets of privately-held uRoam, Inc. a provider of industry-leading remote access solutions using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Networks (VPN). The $25 million cash transaction was completed on July 23, 2003. F5 has hired substantially all of uRoam's employees, including core founders, key development and sales personnel. Under the terms of the deal, F5 has acquired the rights to all of uRoam's technology. uRoam's principal offering is its unique line of FirePass(TM) servers, which enable secure web-based access to any network application from any remote client -- including wireless devices -- with no client set-up and no additions or modifications to the back-end resources being accessed. FirePass servers lead the industry in functionality, stability and scalability, providing secure, web-based user access from more devices to more applications than any other product on the market today. Together with other elements of uRoam's technology, FirePass is a powerful complement to F5's suite of Application Traffic Management products, which already include a number of security features. F5 will continue to develop, sell and support the FirePass product, and over the next 12 - 18 months plans to integrate uRoam's technology into a comprehensive suite of product offerings designed to ensure application security and manageability across the enterprise. "The acquisition of uRoam is an important step toward our goal of providing unsurpassed security in the reliable delivery of enterprise applications," said John McAdam, F5 president and CEO. "Combined with the ability of our BIG-IP(R) product to provide in-line, deep-packet inspection of content and to interface with other network devices as an enforcement engine
Exhibit 99.1 against intrusion and other security threats, uRoam's technology will enable us to provide the most comprehensive application and user security in the industry. As we integrate uRoam's SSL VPN capabilities with current and future F5 products, we believe we can deliver a cost-effective, easy-to-manage application security solution that will meet the current and future needs of our customers and prospects." F5 believes the acquisition of uRoam by F5 will be well received by existing uRoam customers; uRoam's largest customer, SAP America, Inc., was upbeat about the acquisition. "It's critical that our sales force and consultants can securely connect to SAP corporate information from any customer location," said John Harford, director of Network Services, SAP America, Inc. "To help us accomplish this, we implemented uRoam's FirePass solution, which currently provides secure connectivity for our remote user population. We welcome the addition of uRoam's technology to F5's current product offering, as it will present businesses like ours with an even deeper and more comprehensive solution set that can help expand company services and increase the number of remote users worldwide." Skip Glass, former CEO of uRoam, also expressed confidence in F5's ability to leverage the strength of uRoam's technology, "F5's track record, business model and long-term strategy made it an ideal choice in determining how to ensure that the potential of our technology would be realized fully and in ways that are aligned with the future needs of current uRoam customers. Another key factor in our decision was the positive response of our employees to the prospect of joining the F5 team." Commenting on the financial impact of the uRoam acquisition, Steve Coburn, F5's senior vice president of finance and CFO, said he expects early sales of uRoam's products in September but does not expect revenue from those sales to be material in the current quarter, ending September 30, 2003. For fiscal 2004, he said uRoam's products could generate revenue in the range of $8 million to $12 million. In a separate release issued today (http://www.f5.com/f5/news/press/), F5 also announced its complete third quarter financial results. Revenue and earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, ended June 30, 2003, were $29.2 million and $0.05 per share respectively, above management's prior guidance of $27.5 million to $29.0 million and $0.02 to $0.04 per share.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
Our original Form 8-K, dated July 23, 2003, was filed to announce our acquisition of uRoam, Inc. The purpose of this Form 8-K/A is to provide the financial statements of uRoam, Inc. required by Item 7(a) of Form 8-K and the pro forma financial information required by Item 7(b) of Form 8-K. This information was excluded from the original filing in reliance upon item 7(a)(4) of Form 8-K. On July 23, 2003, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uRoam, Inc. and its subsidiaries for cash of $25.0 million. We also incurred $2.4 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of $27.4 million. We accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141). The purchase price allocation is based upon our estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(a) Financial statements of business acquired
On October 1, 2002 uRoam, Inc., originally doing business as Filanet Corporation (Filanet), purchased uRoam Acquisition Corporation (formerly uRoam, Inc.). In December 2002, uRoam, Inc. discontinued the operations formerly conducted by Filanet and changed its name to uRoam, Inc. See Exhibit 99.1 for the audited consolidated financial statements of uRoam, Inc. (formerly Filanet) for the year ended December 31, 2002 and Exhibit 99.2 for the unaudited consolidated financial statements of uRoam, Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. We have also included on Exhibit 99.3 the financial statements of uRoam Acquisition Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to provide a complete year of financial results for the acquired business.
(b) Pro forma financial information
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements have been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of F5 Networks, Inc. (F5 Networks) and uRoam, Inc. (uRoam). Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities had occurred on June 30, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 and for the nine months ended June 30, 2003 have been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2001.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 combines the consolidated statement of operations of F5 Networks for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 with uRoam's consolidated statement of operations for the calendar year ended December 31, 2002 and with uRoam Acquisition Corporation's statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. We have included the nine month period of uRoam Acquisition Corporation to present a complete year of financial results for comparative pro forma reporting purposes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2003 combines the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of F5 Networks for the nine months ended June 30, 2003 with uRoam's unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2003. As a result of different fiscal year ends, uRoam's results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2002 were combined with the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2003 to conform to the nine month period presented for F5 Networks. uRoam's net revenues and loss from continuing operations totalled $0.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2002.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information is based on estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have been made solely for purposes of developing this pro forma information, which is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations of future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.

1. Basis of Unaudited Pro Forma Presentation
On July 23, 2003, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uRoam, Inc. and its subsidiaries (uRoam) for cash of $25.0 million. We also incurred $2.4 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of $27.4 million. We have hired substantially all of uRoam's 20 employees consisting of product development, sales and service personnel. uRoam's FirePass server is a comprehensive remote access product that enables users to access applications in a secure fashion using industry standard Secured Socket Layer (SSL) technology. The acquisition of uRoam is intended to allow us to quickly enter the SSL Virtual Private Network (VPN) market, broaden our customer base and augment our existing product line.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition, accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141). The purchase price allocation is based on management's best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which, based on facts and circumstances are subject to change.
As a result of different fiscal year ends of F5 Networks and uRoam, financial information has been combined for different periods in the pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities had occurred on June 30, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 and for the nine months ended June 30, 2003 have been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2001. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform uRoam's historical and pro forma amounts to F5 Network's financial statement presentation.
2. Acquisition by F5 Networks
We accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information compiled by management, including an independent valuation, prepared by an independent valuation specialist that utilizes established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry. The purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):
To determine the value of the developed technology, a combination of cost and market approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The market approach measures the fair value of the technology through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. The $3.0
Table of Contents
million allocated to developed technology will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years. The $24.2 million allocated to goodwill will not be amortized but will be subject to at least an annual impairment test under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets."
3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflect those matters that are a direct result of the transaction, which are factually supportable and, for pro forma adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations, are expected to have continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are as follows (in thousands):
(A1) F5 Networks funded the purchase of the net assets acquired with the payment of cash and cash equivalents of $10,373, short-term investments of $12,000 and long-term investments of $5,000. Additionally uRoam's cash of $25 was not acquired and has been eliminated.
(A2) Accounts receivable, net have been recorded at estimated net realizable value, which approximates fair value. Accordingly, the carrying value of uRoam's accounts receivable of $389 has been reduced by $54 to reflect amounts that were not considered to be realizable.
(A3) uRoam's other current assets of $152 were not acquired and have been eliminated.
(A4) Goodwill represents the residual of purchase cost, including direct costs relating to the acquisition, over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill recorded in the uRoam acquisition totaled $24,188. The pro forma adjustment of $22,866 is net of uRoam's recorded goodwill of $1,322, which was not acquired and has been eliminated.
(A5) Other assets, net includes purchased technology of $3,000 acquired in the acquisition, net of uRoam's other assets of $1,235, which were not acquired and have been eliminated.
(A6) uRoam's accounts payable of $354 were not assumed in the acquisition and have been eliminated.
(A7) uRoam's short-term debt and capital lease obligations of $11,118 were not assumed in the acquisition and have been eliminated.
(A8) F5 Networks assumed $29 of uRoam's accrued liabilities which have been recorded at fair value. uRoam accrued liabilities of $2,138 were not assumed in the acquisition and have been eliminated.
(A9) The carrying value of uRoam's deferred revenue of $142 has been reduced by $17 to reflect the estimated fair value of F5 Networks future performance obligations.
(A10) uRoam's redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholder's equity balances have been eliminated.
(A11) Cost of net revenues has been increased by $600 and $450 for the year ended September 30, 2002 and the nine months ended June 30, 2003, respectively. The increase reflects additional amortization of developed technology acquired in the acquisition. The developed technology of $3,000 has an estimated useful life of five years and has been reflected as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2001.
(A12) For the year ended September 30, 2002 and the nine months ended June 30, 2003 other income (expense), net has been adjusted to eliminate $626 and $371, respectively. The decrease reflects the historical interest income that was earned on cash held by F5 Networks that was used to fund the acquisition. Additionally, other income (expense), net has been adjusted to eliminate $327 and $546 for the same respective periods for historical interest expense on uRoam's short-term debt and capital lease obligations.

. . . EXHIBIT 99.1 UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY FILANET CORPORATION) INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders and Board of Directors uRoam, Inc. (formerly Filanet Corporation) Sunnyvale, California We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of uRoam, Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly Filanet Corporation) as of December 31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, redeemable convertible preferred stock, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. We did not audit the financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets of $767,000 included in assets of discontinued operations, net of intercompany balances, as of December 31, 2002. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for such subsidiary, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of uRoam, Inc. (formerly Filanet Corporation) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring losses from operations, and has a net capital deficiency and negative working capital at December 31, 2002. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management's plans as to these matters are also discussed in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. s\BDO Seidman, LLP San Francisco, California June 12, 2003, except for Note 11 which is as of July 2, 2003 2

UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization uRoam, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company" or "uRoam") was incorporated in California in 1998. From December 2000 through December 2002, the Company, originally doing business as Filanet Corporation ("Filanet"), marketed a low-cost, broadband solid-state appliance with integrated router and server functionality to small/remote offices. This product, known as the InterJak Internet Service Appliance ("InterJak Product"), enabled broadband service providers to offer a myriad of remotely managed value-added services to telecommuters and small to medium-size businesses from a single extensible platform. On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of uRoam, Inc. ("Predecessor uRoam"), also incorporated in California. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, the Company changed its name to uRoam, Inc. With this acquisition, the Company refocused its investment and resources on applications and software. Since October 1, 2002, the Company's focus has been to develop, market and sell a complete solution for secure user access to applications and desktops, and collaborative tools for real time information sharing. As further described in Note 3, in December 2002, the Company decided to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet. As such, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, net assets and the results of the discontinued operations have been reflected as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated financial statements. With the discontinuance of the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, the Company's continuing operations are comprised of the business activities acquired from Predecessor uRoam and the corporate activities of the merged companies. These continuing operations are treated as a single business segment, and the Company's continuing operations have historically been conducted primarily in the United States of America, with some quality assurance and test activities being performed in Russia. Liquidity and basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since its inception, has an accumulated deficit of $50 million and a deficit in working capital at December 31, 2002, and expects that it will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company has been dependent on its investors to provide financing and loan guarantees to fund operating activities, and management anticipates that the Company will continue to require additional financing to fund operations. At December 31, 2002, the Company was relying on funds provided by a revolving line of credit facility guaranteed by certain investors to fund its operations. At December 31, 2002, the principal balance of this line of credit was $3 million, and there were no remaining funds available to the Company under this facility. Through April 30, 2003, the facility and related guarantees were increased to $4.89 million, and the maturity date has been extended to June 30, 2003. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to pursue additional financing sufficient to fund operations of the Company until revenues from the product sales are sufficient to fund operations. Management is also exploring a possible sale of the Company. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional financing, or that the Company can be sold. If management is unable to obtain additional financing or complete a sale of the Company, operations will need to be ceased. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 8
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As more fully discussed in Note 3, in December 2002, the Company discontinued all operations attributable to its business activities related to the InterJak Product line, including the operations of the Company's subsidiary located in Denmark, Filanet Europe ApS. Accordingly, these operations have been reflected as discontinued in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory, deferred revenue, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, the valuation of the acquisition of Predecessor uRoam, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivables. The Company sells its products to a limited number of companies in diverse industries and generally does not require its customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. During 2002, revenues recognized from five customers represented approximately 32%, 20%, 13%, 13% and 10% of total consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2002, 50%, 17% and 10% of accounts receivable was due from three customers. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, as necessary, in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and existing economic conditions. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, management believes no allowance for doubtful accounts is required as of December 31, 2002. However, actual write-offs might be necessary in the future. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and short-term debt. Cash is reported at fair value. The recorded carrying amount of accounts receivable and short-term debt approximates their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. Estimated useful lives range from two to five years. Included in property and equipment at December 31, 2002 is computer software with a cost basis of $6,000 and accumulated depreciation of $1,000. During 2002, as a result of current and expected future negative net operating cash flows due to the discontinuance of the InterJak Product line, the Company recorded a $434,000 impairment loss relating to the recoverability of certain property and equipment (see Note 3). 9
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenue primarily from sales of its FirePass server product and from related maintenance services. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" since the software component is not considered incidental to its products as a whole. In accordance with SOP 97-2 and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, the Company recognizes revenue upon meeting all of the following criteria: execution of a written customer agreement and purchase order signed by the Company and the customer; product delivery has occurred; the fee for the product is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured and vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement. The Company is migrating its business model to sell to resellers/distributors; however, the Company has historically sold to end customers. When agreements with distributors provide for stock rotation or price protection rights, the Company defers recognition of revenue until sell-through to the end customer has occurred. The Company defers a portion of its product revenues based on the value of certain maintenance arrangements when these arrangements are included with a product sale and recognizes these revenues over the applicable maintenance period. The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements. Revenue from extended maintenance arrangements is recognized over the period of coverage purchased by the customer. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual (first-in, first-out method), or net realizable value. The valuation of inventories at the lower of standard cost or market value requires the use of estimates regarding the amount of inventory that will be sold and the prices at which current inventory will be sold. These estimates are dependent on the Company's assessment of current and expected orders from its customers. The Company has historically not carried significant quantities of FirePass inventory in excess of amounts pertaining to current orders from customers; however, because of lead times associated with components used in manufacturing the InterJak Product line, significant inventories were carried in connection with that product line prior to its discontuance. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company's review of goodwill and other intangible assets is based on the estimated future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. The Company's review is based on its best estimate of a variety of factors, including future market growth, forecasted revenues and costs and a strategic review of its business and operations. In the event the Company determines that an asset is impaired in the future, an adjustment to the value of the asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. 10
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Software Development Costs Costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 86, "Computer Software To Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed." The costs to develop such software have not been capitalized, as the Company believes its current software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). Since the inception of the Company, no stock options were granted at an exercise price below the estimated fair market value of the common stock. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services," under the fair value method. SFAS No. 123 also requires the disclosure of pro forma net loss as if the Company had adopted the fair value method for stock-based awards to employees. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models, even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company's stock option awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The Company's calculations were made using the minimum value method with the following assumptions: expected life one year from vest date; risk free interest rate of 4%, and no dividends during the expected term. The following table represents the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (in thousands): 11
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary is its local currency. The assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end rates of exchange, and income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Since the operations of the foreign subsidiary were discontinued in 2002, gains and losses resulting from translating financial statements into U.S. dollars have been included in loss from discontinued operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in loss from discontinued operations. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002. As the Company did not carry any goodwill or other intangible assets on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2001, the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". SFAS 143 requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized when incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset's useful life. The provisions of SFAS 143 were effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Company does not believe it has any assets at December 31, 2002 that are subject to retirement obligations requiring recognition under SFAS 143. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally EITF Issue No. 94-3. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the Company's commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also established that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring plans. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure," an amendment of SFAS No. 123. Although it does not require use of fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, it does provide alternative methods of transition. It also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in financial statements. SFAS No. 148's amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 12
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). The interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor's obligations do not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements for annual or interim periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has provided disclosures of its guarantees in the accompanying footnotes. The effect of the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions FIN 45 will be based on the nature of guarantees prospectively issued after December 31, 2002, and is not yet determinable. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"), which requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities. FIN 46 is applicable to financial statements issued after 2002, however, disclosures are required currently if the Company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities. There are no entities that will be consolidated with the Company's financial statements as a result of FIN 46. 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITION As described in Note 1, on October 1, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Predecessor uRoam. Prior to the acquisition, the Company conducted business under the name of Filanet. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company changed its name to uRoam, Inc. For acquisition accounting purposes, Filanet was determined to be the acquiring company. The value of the purchase price totaled $1.575 million and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The Company exchanged 3.3 million shares of its Series B-1 Preferred Stock stock with a fair value of $1.03 million for all of the outstanding stock of Predecessor uRoam. The total purchase price also includes $400,000 in pre-acquisition liabilities of Predecessor uRoam paid by Filanet and an estimate of the direct costs associated with the transaction totaling approximately $145,000. All pre-existing Predecessor uRoam stock options and warrants were converted to Predecessor uRoam's common stock or were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information compiled by management, including an independent valuation, prepared by an independent valuation specialist, that utilizes established valuation techniques appropriate for the high technology industry. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be reviewed periodically for impairment. 13
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 A summary of the total purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
Series B-1 preferred stock $ 1,030 Pre-acquisition payments of uRoam liabilities made by Filanet 400 Estimated direct costs of the acquisition 145 ------- Total purchase price $ 1,575 =======
The total purchase price has been preliminarily allocated as follows (in thousands):
Cash $ 42 Accounts receivable 228 Other assets 37 Liabilities assumed (1,154) -------- Fair value of net liabilities assumed (847) Purchased technology 900 Customer base 50 Trademark 100 Non-Compete 50 Goodwill 1,322 -------- Total purchase price $ 1,575 ========
The fair value of net liabilities assumed was reduced by $103,000 resulting from subsequent renegotiation and settlement of certain liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Predecessor uRoam incurred operating losses through the acquisition date. The potential value of the combined companies, products and technologies contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Intangible assets Of the total purchase price, $1.1 million was allocated to intangible assets, including purchased technology, customer base, trademark and non-compete agreements. All of the intangible assets were valued using the income approach, which measures present worth and anticipated future benefits of the intangible asset. This approach calculates the value of the intangible asset as being the present value of the after tax cash flows potentially attributable to it, net of adjustments made to account for the replacement and obsolescence of technology and a fair rate of return on other assets that contribute to the income stream attributable to the intangible asset. Purchased technology and trademark consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and includes Predecessor uRoam's FirePass product line and the related trademark name. The Company is amortizing the fair value of the purchased technology and trademark on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of four years. The customer base represents the value of an installed base of customers that are expected to result in additional licenses under these customers' existing applications. The fair value of the customer base is being amortized based on estimated revenue from identified existing customers over a three year period. Non-compete agreements represent the value of non-compete agreements signed by key executives of Predecessor uRoam. The Company is amortizing the 14
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 fair value of the non-compete agreements on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years. The components of intangible assets as of December 31, 2002 follows (in thousands): Total amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $69,000. Estimated amortization expense for the next four years is as follows (in thousands): 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In December 2002, the Company's board of directors, who also comprised a controlling shareholder interest, unanimously authorized and directed management to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet prior to the Company's acquisition of Predecessor uRoam on October 1, 2002. The decision to discontinue these operations was based on the low margins being achieved in that business, and a decision to concentrate management's efforts and all of the Company's resources on the operations newly acquired from Predecessor uRoam. As a result of the decision to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, management issued termination notices to substantially all employees associated with the InterJak Product operation on or around December 31, 2002, which resulted in a severance accrual totaling $516,000, and management began taking steps to limit the remaining liabilities associated with this business. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2,278,000 and $434,000 to reduce the carrying values of inventories and property and equipment, respectively, of the discontinued business to their estimated net realizable values. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," assets and liabilities of the discontinued business have been segregated from continuing operations in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated balance sheets, and the related operating results have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, and related notes. Revenues of the discontinued operation were $4.7 million in 2002. There were no income tax expenses or benefits recognized in 2002. 15
Balance sheet details of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Assets of discontinued operations: Accounts receivable $ 623 Inventory 670 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 19 Property and equipment, net 17 Other assets 198 ------- Total assets of discontinued operations $ 1,527 ======= Liabilities of discontinued operations: Capital lease obligations $ 428 Accounts payable 2,547 Accrued liabilities 1,517 Deferred revenue 197 ------- Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 4,689 =======
4. OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES Other accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Professional fees $ 50 Accrued interest 56 Compensation and related benefits 107 Other accrued liabilities 112 ------- Total $ 325 =======
5. SHORT-TERM DEBT Short-term debt as of December 31, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Line of credit $ 3,000 Short-term bridge notes payable 4,381 Discount relating to bridge loan facility (23) ------- Total $ 7,358 =======
In March 2002, the Company issued 1,044,386 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to the holders of certain outstanding promissory notes in return for the cancellation of outstanding principal and accrued interest totaling $9,080,000. In August, September, and December 2002, the Company obtained bridge loan financing for an aggregate principal amount of $4,381,000 under Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes ("2002 Bridge Loans") and issued to the lenders warrants to purchase 2,154,992 shares of common stock with an exercise price per share of $0.02. The 2002 Bridge Loans bear interest at the rate of 4.5% per annum and are due on the earlier of one year from issuance or conversion of the notes to demand notes whereby the notes will 16
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 become immediately due and payable upon consent by the noteholders representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes ("Majority in Interest"). The 2002 Bridge Loans are subordinated to the Company's obligations under capital leases, secured by substantially all of the Company's assets (except those assets acquired under capital leases) and convertible into preferred stock at the per share price sold in the Company's next round of preferred stock financing of at least $2.5 million (excluding any notes outstanding which are convertible into preferred stock) upon consent by the Majority in Interest. In the event that the Company undergoes a liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Liquidation Transaction (as defined in the Company's fifth amended and restated articles of incorporation), the Company is obligated to repay 2.5 times the outstanding principal and interest due under the 2002 Bridge Loans prior to any payments to the Company's unsecured creditors and common or preferred stockholders. The Company has allocated the proceeds between the respective estimated fair values of the 2002 Bridge Loans and related warrants resulting in a $35,000 discount to the 2002 Bridge Loans to be amortized to interest expense over a one-year period ending in August 2003 using the effective interest method. The Company recorded $12,000 in interest expense resulting from the amortization of this discount. In October 2002, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit ("Line of Credit") with a bank to provide financing for current operations of the Company. The Line of Credit provides for maximum borrowings of $3,000,000 at the prime interest rate (4.25% at December 31, 2002) and was scheduled to mature on January 1, 2003. In addition, $15,000 in loan fees paid during 2002 in connection with the line of credit agreement were charged to interest expense. The Line of Credit does not have any financial covenants. During 2003, the Line of Credit was increased and maturity date extended (see Note 11). In connection with a guarantee of the Line of Credit provided by the Company's majority stockholders, the Company issued 2,067,958 warrants to purchase common stock at $0.02 per share. In addition, the Company issued 516,988 warrants to the guarantors in both November and December 2002. The $38,000 value of these warrants was recorded as interest expense during 2002. The Company will continue to issue 516,988 warrants per month under the same terms to the guarantors as long as the Line of Credit is outstanding. Through June 12, 2003, the Company had issued 5,686,874 warrants to purchase common stock at $0.02 per share in connection with this guarantee. 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company leases its office facilities under various noncancelable-operating leases. These leases expire at various dates through February 2007 and generally require monthly payment of the prorata share of common area operating expenses. Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable-operating leases, as of December 31, 2002, are as follows (in thousands): Rent expense was approximately $661,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. 17
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 In August 2001, the Company entered into an amendment to one of its office facility lease agreements whereby future monthly cash payments due under the original lease were reduced by approximately $433,000 in aggregate. As consideration of this amendment, the Company issued approximately $433,000 worth of fully vested shares of Series B Preferred Stock. This amount was recorded as an asset to be amortized to rent expense over the remaining lease term. The Company also entered into another facility lease agreement with the same landlord commencing in August 2001, which required monthly payments of approximately $13,000 through November 2005. In March 2002, the Company amended its agreements with the above landlord, which reduced monthly payments for both facilities to approximately $13,000 each, but extended the lease term for both facilities to February 2007. In connection with these amendments, the Company issued 500,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with a value of $96,000. This amount, along with the $305,000 unamortized balance of the prepaid rent relating to the Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 2001 existing as of the lease modification date in March 2002, is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the amended lease term. In connection with the Company's decision to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, in December 2002, the Company gave notice of termination to the landlord of one of its office facility leases located in Denmark. Accordingly, the Company accrued $38,000 for a lease termination liability relating to the fair value of this leasehold and wrote off a $46,000 lease deposit. Legal matters The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. The amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions cannot be reasonably estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any liability resulting from an unfavorable outcome will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. Guarantees The following is a summary of the Company's agreements that have been determined are within the scope of FIN 45. Under its bylaws, the Company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director's serving in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer's or director's lifetime. The Company has a separate indemnification agreement with one of its directors that requires it, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify him to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by its bylaws and the California Corporation Code. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2002. As a result of the acquisition of Predecessor uRoam, the Company assumed a potential liability for events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. Therefore, the Company has no amounts recorded for these possible liabilities as of December 31, 2002. The Company enters into indemnification provisions under (i) its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, and customers, landlords and (ii) its agreements with investors. Under these provisions the Company generally indemnifies and holds 18
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company's activities or, in some cases, as a result of the indemnified party's activities under the agreement. These indemnification provisions often include indemnifications relating to representations made by the Company with regard to intellectual property rights. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2002. 7. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK In March 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company consented to the automatic conversion to common shares of all outstanding shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock. In accordance with this consent, the Series A and Series B preferred stock were converted into 181,806 common shares at a 1:1 exchange ratio immediately prior to the closing of the Series A-1 Offering in March 2002. In March and April 2002, the Company sold an aggregate of 30,461,570 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for proceeds totaling $5,410,000 (net of cash issuance costs of $186,000). In connection with this sale of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Company also issued 1,044,386 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock in exchange for the cancellation of outstanding principal and accrued interest totaling $9,080,000 due under certain notes payable. Additionally, the Company issued 500,000, 65,274, 323,655 and 1,305,478 shares of fully vested Series A-1 Preferred Stock at $0.1915 per share in exchange for renegotiation of rental payments, executive search services, accrued compensation, and severance, respectively. The Company recorded the deemed fair value of the shares issued for severance ($250,000) and in exchange for executive search services ($12,000) as an expense in 2002. The fair value of the shares issued for renegotiation of rental payments ($96,000) is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the amended five year term of the lease agreement. The significant terms of the preferred stock are as follows: Conversion Rights. Each share of Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder or will automatically be converted to common stock upon a public offering of common stock at a public offering price of at least $0.9575 per share and which yields gross proceeds of at least $20,000,000 or written consent of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares of all classes of preferred stock. Each share of Series A-1 preferred stock is convertible into such number of shares of common stock as determined by dividing $0.1915 by $0.29070358. According to this conversion ratio, the 33,700,363 shares of Series A-1 preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2002 is convertible into 22,200,000 shares of common stock. Each share of Series B-1 preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock. The conversion of preferred stock is subject to adjustment for events of dilution, and the preferred stock has the same voting rights as the number of common shares into which it is convertible. Dividends. If and when declared by the Board of Directors, and in preference to dividends on the common and Series B-1 preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-1 preferred stock are entitled to receive noncumulative dividends of $0.013405 per share per annum. After the Series A-1 convertible preferred stockholders receive their dividend preference, any additional dividends shall be distributed among the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and common stock pro rata 19
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 based on the number of shares of common stock then held by each holder (assuming conversion of all preferred stock to common stock). Redemption rights. The Company shall redeem the Series A-1 Preferred Stock at any time after January 31, 2006 upon notice from at least two-thirds of the Series A-1 holders. The Series A-1 Preferred Stock is redeemable at a price of $0.1915 per share plus all declared or accumulated unpaid dividends. If redemption of fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock is requested, the Company shall redeem such stock on a pro rata basis. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock is not mandatorily redeemable. Liquidation Preference. Holders of Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock have a liquidation preference over the common stock holders of $0.1915 per share for each share of Series A-1 and $0.3085 per share for each share of Series B-1, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. After this payment to the holders of the Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock, the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company shall be distributed among the holders of the common, Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock in proportion to the equivalent number of shares of common stock on an "as converted basis" then held by them until each holder of the Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock shall have received $0.5745 and $0.9255 per share, respectively. Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Series A-1 and Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which such preferred stock could be converted. With respect to such vote, holders have full voting rights and powers equal to those of the holders of common stock and are entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting. Because each series of convertible preferred stock has conditions for liquidation or redemption that are deemed outside the control of the Company, such preferred stock has been classified outside of stockholders' deficit. At December 31, 2002, there were 37,038,663 authorized shares of preferred stock, 33,700,363 shares of which were designated Series A-1 Preferred Stock; 3,338,300 shares of which were designated Series B-1 Preferred Stock. A summary of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2002 is as follows (in thousands, except share amounts): 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY In March 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a reverse stock split whereby each outstanding share of common stock including outstanding warrants and options to purchase shares of common stock were converted into 0.00907281 shares of Common Stock. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted to give effect to this reverse stock split. 20

The Company allows the early exercise of certain employee and non-employee stock options, resulting in the exercise of 450,809 stock options and $9,000 in proceeds to the Company in 2002. However, under the terms of the Early Exercise and Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement entered into with these individuals, the Company reserves the right to repurchase any unvested shares at the original price per share over the remaining option vesting period. As of December 31, 2002, 123,500 stock options exercised under this arrangement with an aggregate exercise price totaling $174,000 may be repurchased by the Company. 22
UROAM, INC.

These warrants expire at various dates through October 2007. These warrants were amended to purchase shares of common stock at the exercise prices noted above in connection with the conversion of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock to common stock in March 2002 and were still outstanding as of December 31, 2002. In 2002, in connection with obtaining bridge financing in the form of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase 2,154,992 shares of common stock at $0.02 per share with a term of ten years. The warrants were valued at $35,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: contractual life of ten years; risk free interest rate of 4.26%; volatility of 70% and no dividends during the expected term. The value of the warrants was classified as a debt discount, of which $12,000 was amortized to interest expense in 2002. In 2002, in connection with a guarantee of a line of credit provided by the Company's majority stockholders, the Company issued warrants to purchase common stock at $0.02 per share with a term of approximately 3 1/2 years. The number of shares of common stock that can be purchased under the warrants is 2,067,958 plus 516,988 warrants for every month that the guarantee on the line of credit is outstanding. The 3,101,934 warrants issued during 2002 were valued at approximately $38,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: contractual life of 3 1/2 years; risk-free interest rate range of 4.26%; volatility of 70% and no dividends during the expected term. The entire value of the warrants was recorded as interest expense in 2002.

As of December 31, 2002, the balance of these bridge notes due to majority stockholders was $4,381,000. In addition, the Company's majority shareholders have guaranteed the Company's line of credit with a bank. In connection with this guarantee, the Company issued 3,101,934 warrants to purchase common stock at $0.02 per share to the guarantors during 2002. 23
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 10. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions and operating loss carryforwards, net of a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized. No income taxes were provided for any periods presented due to the Company's net losses. The Company's deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2002 are comprised of the following (in thousands):
Net deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 18,203 Deferred income 89 Accruals deductible in different periods 91 Research and development credits 1,693 Depreciation and amortization (27) ------------ Total deferred tax assets 20,049 Valuation allowance (20,049) ------------ Net deferred tax assets $ -- ============
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefits of its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, as of December 31, 2002, the Company has fully reserved its net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company has available net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $46,000,000 and $35,000,000 to offset future federal and state taxable income, respectively. The federal NOL carryforwards expire in various years through 2022, while the state NOL carryforwards expire in various years through 2010. At December 31, 2002, the Company also has research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $765,000 and $928,000 available to offset future federal and state income taxes, respectively. The federal credit carryforward expires in various years through 2022, while the state credit carryforward has no expiration. Current tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change," as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. If there should be an ownership change, the Company's ability to utilize its carryforwards could be limited. California has disallowed the use of net operating losses in the 2002 and 2003 tax years. 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2003, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding with a creditor providing equipment financing under capital leases whereby the creditor agreed to forebear collecting January and February rental payments until February 28, 2003, at which time all past due rental payments would be payable. The Company did not make the required February 28, 2003 payment or the March through June 2003 monthly payments due under the master lease agreement. This represents an event of default under the master lease agreement, which allows the creditor to request an acceleration of the remaining payments due from the Company. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owed $705,000 to this 24
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 creditor under the master lease agreement, all of which is reflected in total liabilities of discontinued operations. In January and February 2003, the Company received $506,000 of additional bridge loans from its majority stockholders under the same terms as the previous 2002 Bridge Loans. In March, April, May, and June 2003, the Company entered into successive amendments to its revolving line of credit, which have ultimately increased the principal amount to $6.453 million. Additionally, the maturity date for the line of credit was extended to July 15, 2003. In connection with these amendments, the guarantors of the line of credit continued to increase their guarantee of the Company's debt under the line of credit to the amended principal amount. On April 29, 2003, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding with one of its landlords providing the Company the option to terminate two of its office facility lease agreements. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company would continue to pay rentals due under the lease agreements through the projected lease termination date on July 31, 2003, at which time the Company had the option to make a termination payment of approximately $313,000 and forego the $50,000 security deposit on the leases. In July 2003, the Company terminated these leases and $334,000 of prepaid rents relating to the issuance of Series B and Series A-1 preferred stock, of which $167,000 is reflected in total assets of discontinued operations, was written off. Subsequent to December 31, 2002, the Company entered into settlement agreements with certain of its vendors which provided for the settlement and release from payment of approximately $280,000 of trade accounts payable. The effects of these settlement agreements will be recorded in the period that the settlement agreement was entered into. On June 30, 2003, the Company signed a non-binding term sheet whereby substantially all of the Company's assets would be acquired. The completion of the merger transaction is contingent upon, among other things, the satisfactory performance of due diligence and execution of a definitive merger agreement. On July 2, 2003, the Company received a copy of a complaint filed by a company alleging breach of contract and other claims related to exclusivity provisions of a March 2003 cover letter for a preliminary non-binding term sheet in contemplation of the plaintiff's proposed acquisition of the Company. The complaint indicates that the plaintiff incurred damages of no less than $2 million and seeks to recover all damages and require the Company's performance with respect to the March 2003 letter agreement. The Company believes that the complaint is without merit and has hired litigation counsel to defend itself vigorously should the plaintiff continue to pursue its claims. 25

UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization uRoam, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company" or "uRoam") was incorporated in California in 1998. From December 2000 through December 2002, the Company, originally doing business as Filanet Corporation ("Filanet"), marketed a low-cost, broadband solid-state appliance with integrated router and server functionality to small/remote offices. This product, known as the InterJak Internet Service Appliance ("InterJak Product"), enabled broadband service providers to offer a myriad of remotely managed value-added services to telecommuters and small to medium-size businesses from a single extensible platform. On October 1, 2002, the Company, acquired all of the outstanding stock of uRoam, Inc. ("Predecessor uRoam"), also incorporated in California. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, the Company changed its name to uRoam, Inc. With this acquisition, the Company refocused its investment and resources on applications and software. Since October 1, 2002, the Company's focus has been to develop, market and sell a complete solution for secure user access to applications and desktops, and collaborative tools for real time information sharing. As further described in Note 2, in December 2002, the Company decided to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet. As such, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, net assets and the results of the discontinued operations have been reflected as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated financial statements. With the discontinuance of the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, the Company's continuing operations are comprised of the business activities acquired from Predecessor uRoam and the corporate activities of the merged companies. These continuing operations are treated as a single business segment, and the Company's continuing operations have historically been conducted primarily in the United States of America, with some quality assurance and test activities being performed in Russia. On July 23, 2003, the Company sold substantially all of its assets and selected liabilities to F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5") for $25 million in cash. Liquidity and basis of presentation In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2003 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 have been derived from the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements, but do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2002. The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since its inception, has an accumulated deficit of approximately $50 million at December 31, 2002 and a deficit in working capital, and continued to incur losses through June 30, 2003. The Company has been dependent on its investors to provide financing and a guarantee of a bank line of credit to fund operating activities. At December 31, 2002, the principal balance of this line of credit was $3 million, and there were no remaining funds available to the Company under this facility. At June 30, 2003, available financing under the facility and related guarantees had 5
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) been increased to $6.453 million, and the maturity date had been extended to July 15, 2003. Through July 23, 2003, the facility and related guarantees were further increased to $6.75 million. However, with the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets to F5 for $25 million in cash on July 23, 2003, all principal and accrued interest borrowed under this facility was repaid in full. The Company now believes that it has adequate resources to fund its operations and repay its obligations. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As more fully discussed in Note 2, in December 2002, the Company discontinued all operations attributable to its business activities related to the InterJak Product line, including the operations of the Company's subsidiary located in Denmark, Filanet Europe ApS ("Filanet Europe"). Accordingly, these operations have been reflected as discontinued in the consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, deferred revenue, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, the valuation of the acquisition of Predecessor uRoam, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In December 2002, the Company's board of directors, who also comprised a controlling shareholder interest, unanimously authorized and directed management to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet prior to the Company's acquisition of Predecessor uRoam on October 1, 2002. The decision to discontinue these operations was based on the low margins being achieved in that business, and a decision to concentrate management's efforts and all of the Company's resources on the operations newly acquired from Predecessor uRoam. As a result of the decision to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, management provided termination notices to substantially all employees associated with the InterJak Product operation on or around December 31, 2002, which resulted in a severance accrual totaling $516,000. Management also began taking steps to limit the remaining liabilities associated with this business. In addition, at December 31, 2002, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2,278,000 and $434,000 to reduce the carrying value of inventories and property and equipment, respectively, of the discontinued business to their estimated net realizable values. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company recorded a $1,106,000 gain from discontinued operations. This was primarily attributable to the recognition of $1.2 million of revenues relating to the discontinued InterJak Produce line at Filanet Europe and the settlement and release from payment of $300,000 of trade accounts payable which were recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003, the period that the settlement occurred. Additionally, due to the termination of substantially all employees associated with the InterJak Product operation and the related 2002 severance accruals, the ongoing expenses of the discontinued operations in 2003 significantly decreased from that previously incurred. Revenues of the discontinued operation were $2.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2002. There were no income tax expenses or benefits recognized in 2003 or 2002. 6
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," assets and liabilities of the discontinued business have been segregated from continuing operations in the consolidated balance sheet, and the related operating results have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, and related notes. Balance sheet details of Discontinued Operations as of June 30, 2003 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Assets of discontinued operations: Accounts receivable $ 2 Inventory 15 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 19 Property and equipment, net 16 Other assets 260 ------------ Total assets of discontinued operations $ 312 ============ Liabilities of discontinued operations: Capital lease obligations $ 204 Accounts payable 1,263 Accrued liabilities 35 Deferred revenue 3 ------------ Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 1,505 ============
3. SHORT-TERM DEBT Short-term debt as of June 30, 2003 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Line of credit $ 5,854 Short-term bridge notes payable 4,887 Discount relating to bridge loan facility (5) ------------ Total $ 10,736 ============
In August, September, and December 2002, the Company obtained bridge loan financing from its majority shareholders for an aggregate principal amount of $4,381,000 under Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes ("2002 Bridge Loans") and issued to the lenders warrants to purchase 2,154,992 shares of common stock with an exercise price per share of $0.02. In January and February 2003, the Company obtained an additional $506,000 in bridge loan financing from its majority shareholders under the same terms as the 2002 Bridge Loans, except that no additional warrants were issued. The 2002 Bridge Loans bear interest at the rate of 4.5% per annum and are due on the earlier of one year from issuance or conversion of the notes to demand notes whereby the notes will become immediately due and payable upon consent by the noteholders representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes ("Majority in Interest"). The 2002 Bridge Loans are subordinated to the Company's obligations under capital leases, secured by substantially all of the Company's assets (except those assets acquired under capital leases) and convertible into preferred stock at the per share price sold in the Company's next round of preferred stock financing of at least $2.5 million (excluding any notes outstanding which are convertible into preferred stock) upon consent by the Majority in Interest. In the event that the Company undergoes a liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Liquidation Transaction (as defined in the Company's fifth amended and restated articles of incorporation), the Company is obligated to repay 2.5 7
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) times the outstanding principal and interest due ("Investor Premium") under the 2002 Bridge Loans prior to any payments to the Company's unsecured creditors and common or preferred stockholders. The Company has allocated the proceeds between the respective estimated fair values of the 2002 Bridge Loans and related warrants resulting in a $35,000 discount to the 2002 Bridge Loans to be amortized to interest expense over a one-year period ending in August 2003 using the effective interest method. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company recorded $18,000 in interest expense resulting from the amortization of this discount. All principal and accrued interest outstanding on the Company's short-term bridge notes payable was repaid in full upon the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets to F5 on July 23, 2003, which qualified as a Liquidation Transaction. In addition, on July 23, 2003, the bridge notes were amended such that; 1) the conversion feature to capital stock of the Company was eliminated, 2) the 2,154,992 warrants issued to the lenders of the 2002 Bridge Loans were cancelled and 3) the Investor Premium would only apply to $3.5 million of the principal balance, and that this Investor Premium would be payable only upon the approval of the Company's board of directors and after all debts and liabilities of the Company had been provided for in a cash reserve account. In October 2002, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit ("Line of Credit") with a bank to provide financing for current operations of the Company. At June 30, 2003, the Line of Credit provides for maximum borrowings of $6.453 million, of which $5.854 million was outstanding, at the prime interest rate (4.25% at June 30, 2003) and was originally scheduled to mature on July 15, 2003. Through July 23, 2003, availability under the facility and related guarantees were further increased to $6.75 million. Upon the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets to F5 on July 23, 2003, all principal and accrued interest borrowed under this facility was repaid in full. In connection with a guarantee of the Line of Credit provided by the Company's majority stockholders, the Company issued 2,067,958 warrants to purchase common stock at $0.02 per share. In addition, the Company issued 516,988 warrants at the same exercise price to the guarantors in both November and December 2002. The $38,000 value of these warrants was recorded as interest expense during 2002. The Company was obligated to continue to issue 516,988 warrants per month under the same terms to the guarantors as long as the Line of Credit was outstanding through June 2003 and issued an aggregate of 3,101,928 during the six months ended June 30, 2003. The warrants issued during 2003 were valued at $32,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: contractual life of 3 1/2 years; risk free interest rate of 4%, volatility of 70% and no dividends during the expected term. In July 2003, the 6,203,862 warrants issued during 2002 and 2003 in connection with the guarantee of the Line of Credit were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition of the Company's assets by F5. 4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company leases its office facilities under various noncancelable-operating leases. These leases expire at various dates through February 2007 and generally require monthly payment of the prorata share of common area operating expenses. Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable 8
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) operating leases, as of June 30, 2003, are as follows (in thousands): Rent expense was approximately $249,000 and $281,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In August 2001, the Company entered into an amendment to one of its office facility lease agreements whereby future monthly cash payments due under the original lease were reduced by approximately $433,000 in aggregate. As consideration of this amendment, the Company issued approximately $433,000 worth of fully vested shares of Series B Preferred Stock. This amount was recorded as an asset to be amortized to rent expense over the remaining lease term. The Company also entered into another facility lease agreement with the same landlord commencing in August 2001, which required monthly payments of approximately $13,000 through November 2005. In March 2002, the Company amended its agreements with the above landlord, which reduced monthly payments for both facilities to approximately $13,000 each, but extended the lease term for both facilities to February 2007. In connection with these amendments, the Company issued 500,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with a value of $96,000. This amount, along with the $305,000 unamortized balance of the prepaid rent relating to the Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 2001 existing as of the lease modification date in March 2002, is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the amended lease term. On April 29, 2003, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding with the above landlord providing the Company the option to terminate two of its office facility lease agreements. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company would continue to pay rentals due under the lease agreements through the projected lease termination date on July 31, 2003, at which time the Company had the option to make a termination payment of approximately $313,000 and forego the $50,000 security deposit on the leases. In July 2003, the Company terminated these leases, and $270,000 of prepaid rents existing as of June 30, 2003 relating to the issuance of Series B and Series A-1 preferred stock, of which $135,000 is reflected in total assets of discontinued operations and $135,000 is reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets, was written off subsequent to June 30, 2003. In connection with the Company's decision to discontinue the operations formerly conducted by Filanet, in December 2002 the Company gave notice of termination to the landlord of one of its office facility leases located in Denmark. Accordingly, the Company accrued $38,000 for a lease termination liability relating to the fair value of this leasehold and wrote off a $46,000 lease deposit as of December 31, 2002. The Company vacated the facility in Denmark on June 30, 2003. Legal matters The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. The amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions cannot be reasonably estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any liability resulting from an unfavorable outcome will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. See Note 7 for details of a complaint filed against the Company in July 2003. 9
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) Guarantees In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial Interpretation Number ("FIN") 45 "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others -- an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FIN 34." The Company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002. The following is a summary of the Company's agreements that have been determined are within the scope of FIN 45. Under its bylaws, the Company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director's serving in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer's or director's lifetime. The Company has a separate indemnification agreement with one of its directors that requires it, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify him to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by its bylaws and the California Corporation Code. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of June 30, 2003. As a result of the acquisition of Predecessor uRoam, the Company assumed a potential liability for events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. Therefore, the Company has no amounts recorded for these possible liabilities as of June 30, 2003. The Company enters into indemnification provisions under (i) its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, and customers, landlords and (ii) its agreements with investors. Under these provisions the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company's activities or, in some cases, as a result of the indemnified party's activities under the agreement. These indemnification provisions often include indemnifications relating to representations made by the Company with regard to intellectual property rights. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of June 30, 2003. Settlement of Trade Payables During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company entered into settlement agreements with certain of its vendors which provided for the settlement and release from payment of approximately $300,000 of trade accounts payable. The effects of these settlement agreements have been recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003 as a credit to the gain from discontinued operations. 5. COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to 10
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) Employees" (APB 25). During 2003 and 2002, no stock options were granted at an exercise price below the estimated fair market value of the common stock. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and EITF Issue No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services," under the fair value method. SFAS No. 123 also requires the disclosure of pro forma net loss as if the Company had adopted the fair value method for stock-based awards to employees. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models, even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company's stock option awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The Company's calculations were made using the minimum value pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life, one year from vest date; risk free interest rate of 4% in 2003 and 2002, and no dividends during the expected term. The following table represents the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): During the six months ended June 30, 2003 options to purchase 119,752 shares of the Company's common stock were exercised resulting in proceeds of $3,000. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company received repayments of notes receivable from stockholders aggregating $39,000. 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On July 23, 2003, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with F5 whereby substantially all of the Company's assets were acquired and certain ongoing liabilities were assumed for the aggregate cash consideration of $25 million. In addition, F5 paid $650,000 in closing costs incurred by the Company as a result of the completion of the transaction. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, 10% of the aggregate consideration, or $2.5 million, was deposited in an escrow account to be held for a one-year period to satisfy certain potential indemnification provisions of the asset purchase agreement. As more fully described in Note 3, all principal and accrued interest outstanding on the Company's short-term debt was repaid in full utilizing the proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets on July 23, 2003. Additionally, in connection with an amendment to the bridge note agreements immediately prior to the sale of the Company's assets, the Company is obligated to pay an additional Investor Premium of $5,250,000 to certain bridge note holders, subject to the approval of the Company's board of directors and after all debts and liabilities of the Company had been provided for in a cash reserve account. 11
UROAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited and in thousands) As more fully described in Note 4, the Company terminated two of its office facility lease agreements in July 2003 by paying a $313,000 termination payment and foregoing the $50,000 security deposit. In July 2003, the Company received a copy of a complaint filed by a company alleging breach of contract and other claims related to exclusivity provisions of a March 2003 cover letter for a preliminary non-binding term sheet in contemplation of the plaintiff's proposed acquisition of the Company. The complaint indicates that the plaintiff incurred damages of no less than $2 million and seeks to recover all damages and require the Company's performance with respect to the March 2003 letter agreement. The Company believes that the complaint is without merit and has hired litigation counsel to defend itself vigorously. In January 2003, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding with a creditor providing equipment financing under capital leases whereby the creditor agreed to forebear collecting January and February rental payments until February 28, 2003, at which time all past due rental payments would be payable. The Company did not make the required February 28, 2003 payment or the March, April, May, June or July 2003 monthly payments due under the master lease agreement. This represented an event of default under the master lease agreement, which allowed the creditor to request an acceleration of the remaining payments due from the Company. As of June 30, 2003, the Company owed $735,000 to this creditor under the master lease agreement, all of which is reflected in total liabilities of discontinued operations. On July 23, 2003, the Company paid $727,000 in full satisfaction of all of the Company's obligations to this creditor. 12

UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Uroam Acquisition Corporation was incorporated in California in 1998. From inception through September 30, 2002, the Company, originally doing business as uRoam, Inc. ("uRoam" or "Predecessor uRoam"), marketed a server based solution that provided secure, web-based remote access from multiple devices to numerous applications. This product, known as the FirePass Server ("FirePass"), provides a web-based alternative. FirePass enables companies to extend secure remote access to anyone connected to the Internet with no special software or configuration on the remote device, and with no additions or modifications to the back-end resources being accessed. This approach eliminates the support burden of traditional remote access such as IPSec, VPN and RAS, and adds application functionality going considerably beyond mere connectivity. The Company's operations are treated as a single business segment and have historically been conducted primarily in the United States of America, with some quality assurance and test activities being performed in Russia. On October 1, 2002, all of the outstanding stock of the Company was acquired by a Company now known as uRoam, Inc., formerly known as Filanet Corporation ("Filanet"). Prior to the acquisition, the Company conducted business under the name of uRoam, Inc. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company changed its name to uRoam Acquisition Corp. For acquisition accounting purposes, uRoam, Inc., formerly known as Filanet, was determined to be the acquiring company. The value of the purchase price totaled $1.575 million and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The Company exchanged all of its equity for 3.3 million shares of the acquiror's Series B-1 Preferred Stock with an estimated fair value of $1 million. The total purchase price also includes $400,000 in pre-acquisition liabilities of the Company paid by Filanet and $175,000 in costs directly related to the acquisition. All pre-existing Predecessor uRoam stock options and warrants were converted to Predecessor uRoam's common stock or were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition. Basis of presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory, deferred revenue, recoverability of accounts receivable, valuation of warrants and stock options provided for outside services, and estimates of accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The Company sells its products to a limited number of companies in 8
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 diverse industries and generally does not require its customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, revenues recognized from four customers represented approximately 13%, 13%, 11%, and 10% of total revenues. As of September 30, 2002, 50%, 19% and 16% of accounts receivable was due from three customers. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, as necessary, in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and existing economic conditions. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, management believes no allowance for doubtful accounts is required as of September 30, 2002. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and short-term debt. Cash is reported at fair value. The recorded carrying amount of accounts receivable and short-term debt approximates their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. Estimated useful lives range from two to five years. Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenue primarily from sales of its FirePass server product and from related maintenance services. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" since the software component is not considered incidental to its products as a whole. In accordance with SOP 97-2 and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, the Company recognizes revenue upon meeting all of the following criteria: execution of a written customer agreement and purchase order signed by the Company and the customer; product delivery has occurred; the fee for the product is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured and vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement. The Company has historically sold to end customers. When agreements with distributors provide for stock rotation or price protection rights, the Company defers recognition of revenue until sell through to the end customer has occurred. The Company defers a portion of its product revenues based on the value of certain maintenance arrangements included with each product sale and recognizes these revenues over the applicable maintenance period. The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements. Revenue from extended maintenance arrangements is recognized over the period of coverage purchased by the customer. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The valuation of inventories at the lower of standard cost or market value requires the use of estimates regarding the amount of inventory that will be sold and the prices at which current 9
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 inventory will be sold. These estimates are dependent on the Company's assessment of current and expected orders from its customers. The Company has historically not carried significant quantities of FirePass inventory in excess of amounts pertaining to current orders from customers. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company's review is based on the estimated future cash flows the assets are expected to generate using the best estimate of a variety of factors, including future market growth, forecasted revenues and costs and a strategic review of its business and operations. In the event the Company determines that an asset is impaired in the future, an adjustment to the value of the asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Software Development Costs Costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, "Computer Software To Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed." The costs to develop such software have not been capitalized, as the Company believes its current software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). The Company accounts for stock-based awards to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services," under the fair value method. SFAS No. 123 also requires the disclosure of pro forma net loss as if the Company had adopted the fair value method for stock-based awards to employees. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models, even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company's stock option awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The Company's calculations were made using the minimum value pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of one year from vest date; risk free interest rate of 4% and no dividends during the expected term. 10
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 The following table represents the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (in thousands): 2. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment as of September 30, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Computer and networking equipment $ 84 Less accumulated depreciation 79 ------------ Property and equipment, net $ 5 ============
In 2002, the Company reassessed the remaining lives of its fixed assets and as a result recorded additional depreciation of approximately $20,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002. 3. ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Professional fees $ 19 Accrued interest 13 Compensation and related benefits 112 Other accrued liabilities 51 ------------ Total $ 195 ============
4. SHORT-TERM DEBT Short-term debt as of September 30, 2002 consisted of the following (in thousands):
Notes payable to stockholders $ 305 Notes payable to employees 449 ------------ Total $ 754 ============
During 2000, 2001 and 2002, certain employees elected to receive salary in the form of notes payable. Several employees entered into multiple deferral elections during this period. The agreements provided for interest to be earned ranging from 6% to 10% per annum and contained varying repayment terms. On July 30, 2002, the Company converted certain outstanding employee loans totaling $367,000 into 11
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 156,710 shares of Series B Preferred Stock using a conversion price of $2.34 per share. Subsequent to the acquisition referenced in Note 1 above, all remaining employee notes payable were repaid. During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company obtained bridge note financing from several of its stockholders for an aggregate principal amount of $305,000. The bridge notes bore interest at the rate of 10% per annum, and became due and payable as of the effective date of the acquisition referenced in Note 1 above. Subsequent to the acquisition, the bridge notes were repaid in full by the acquirer. 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company leases its Fremont office facilities under a non-cancelable-operating lease. This lease expires at June 30, 2003 and requires monthly payment of the pro rata share of common area operating expenses. Future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable-operating leases, as of September 30, 2002, are as follows (in thousands): Rent expense was approximately $68,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. The Company plans to vacate this space at the end of the current lease term, which is June 30, 2003. The Company also leased office space in Tomsk, Russia; however, this was under a cancelable lease which was subsequently cancelled effective February 2003. Legal matters The Company was involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. The amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions cannot be reasonably estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any liability resulting from an unfavorable outcome will not materially affect the financial position or operating results of the Company. 6. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK In July of 2002 the Company agreed with certain employees to convert an aggregate $366,700 of deferred compensation notes payable into 156,710 shares of Series B Preferred stock. In August 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company consented to the automatic conversion to common shares of all outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. In accordance with this consent, the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock were converted into 1,112,757 common shares at a 1:1 exchange ratio. The Series B Preferred Stock contained redemption provisions that, among other requirements, provided for the redemption amount to be equal to be equal to $2.34 per share of Series B plus $0.1872 per share per annum for each year elapsed. Accordingly the Company recorded $186,000 in accretion of Series B 12
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2002. Such accretion has been reflected as a charge to common shareholders in the statement of operations. 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 1998 Stock Option Plan The 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "1998 Plan") authorized the grant of options to purchase up to 481,250 shares of the Company's common stock. Under the 1998 Plan, incentive options may be granted at a price per share no less than the fair market value of common stock at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price per share no less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted to any 10% stockholder may have an exercise price per share that is not less than 110% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of grant. Options granted are immediately exercisable, and unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the amount originally paid. Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over four years. At September 30 2002, 32,083 shares issued under the 1998 Plan were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average price of $0.15 per share because such shares were not vested. The Company determined that an aggregate of 259,319 options to purchase common stock issued during 2002, 2001 and 2000 with an exercise price of $0.25 per share were issued when the estimated value of the underlying common stock was determined by the Company to be $0.59 per share. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $31,000 in deferred stock-based compensation cost, net of cancellations, and $9,000 in related amortization of deferred stock-based compensation during 2002. Stock option activity under the 1998 Plan is summarized as follows: All options outstanding were cancelled prior to the Company's acquisition by Filanet. Warrants In 2002, in connection with obtaining bridge financing in the form of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes, the Company issued 3,600 warrants to purchase Common stock at an exercise price of $2.34. The warrants expire in 10 years. The Company valued the warrants at $2,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: contractual life of 10 years; risk free interest rate of 4.0%; volatility of 85% and no dividends during the expected term. The entire amount was recorded as interest expense in 2002. These warrants were cancelled in connection with the acquisition described in Note 1. 13
UROAM ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 8. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions and operating loss carryforwards, net of a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized. No income taxes were provided for any periods presented due to the Company's net losses. The Company's deferred income tax assets of approximately $1.8 million at September 30, 2002 are comprised primarily of net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefits of its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, as of September 30, 2002, the Company has fully reserved its net deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2002, the Company has available NOL carryforwards of approximately $4.5 million to offset future federal and state taxable income. The federal NOL carryforwards expire in various years through 2022, while the state NOL carryforwards expire in various years through 2010. Current tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change," as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Given that there was an ownership change, the Company's ability to utilize its carryforwards could be limited. California has disallowed the use of net operating losses in the 2002 and 2003 tax years. 14

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WA  October 29, 2003  F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced net revenue of $31.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, up 8 percent from $29.2 million in the prior quarter and 17 percent from $27.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Fourth quarter net income was $1.4 million ($0.05 per share) compared to net income of $1.4 million ($0.05 per share) in the third quarter and a net loss of $423,000 ($0.02 per share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. Both net revenue and income for the quarter exceeded the target ranges ($0.02 to $0.03 per share on revenue of $29.5 million to $30.5 million) set by management in the company's July 23rd earnings release.
For fiscal 2003, the company had net income of $4.1 million ($0.14 per diluted share) on record annual net revenue of $115.9 million compared to a fiscal 2002 net loss of $8.6 million ($0.34 per share) on net revenue of $108.3 million.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's top-line growth was a result of continued strengthening in its core business, augmented by initial sales of its recently acquired FirePass SSL VPN products. "During the quarter, overall product and service revenue grew 8 percent and 9 percent respectively from the prior quarter, while gross margin held steady at 77 percent of revenue. Sales were up across all product categories, with systems and software representing 68 percent and 5 percent of revenue respectively. Switch sales represented 67 percent of systems revenue."
On a regional basis, McAdam said Japan and North America drove the company's net revenue growth in Q4. "Japanese sales rebounded from the seasonally slow June quarter that marks the beginning of Japan's fiscal year. In North America, we continued to see the strengthening in product sales and service revenue that has characterized the last two quarters.
 
F5 Networks Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Earnings
"A key factor in the strong growth of North American sales was the increasing contribution of our sales channels. In addition, our focus on major accounts and our investments in our iControl partnership program also continued to pay dividends. Sales to new and existing major accounts were up sequentially in dollars and as a percent of total revenue in Q4. Sales involving one or more iControl partners  principally Microsoft, BEA, Oracle, and IBM (Websphere)  were also up sequentially and represented a growing percentage of quarterly revenue," McAdam said.
Along with its strong operating results, the company's balance sheet continued to improve during the fourth quarter. After spending $27.4 million to acquire substantially all of the assets of uRoam in July, F5 ended the year with $79 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Operating cash flow of $5.6 million in Q4 reflected days sales outstanding (DSOs) of 55 days.
Based on the company's strong Q4 results and the strength of the current sales pipeline, McAdam said he expects to see continued revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and into the next calendar year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2004, ending December 31, 2003, McAdam said the company has set a net revenue target of $32 million to $34 million, with net income in the range of $0.06 to $0.08 per share.

Table of Contents
On July 23, 2003, we filed a Form 8-K to announce our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uRoam, Inc., which we refer to as uRoam. On September 15, 2003, we filed a Form 8-K/A to provide the financial statements of uRoam required by Item 7(a) of Form 8-K and the pro forma financial information required Item 7(b) of Form 8-K. The purpose of this Form 8-K is to provide updated pro forma financial information required by Rule 11-02(c) of Regulation S-X.
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(b) Pro forma financial information
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements have been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of F5 Networks, Inc., or F5 Networks, and uRoam. Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information combines the consolidated statement of operations of F5 Networks for the year ended September 30, 2003 with uRoam's unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2003 and the unaudited statement of operations for the period July 1, 2003 through July 23, 2003, the effective date of the uRoam acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information is based on estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have been made solely for purposes of developing this pro forma information, which is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations of future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
1. Basis of Unaudited Pro Forma Presentation
On July 23, 2003, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uRoam and its subsidiaries for cash of $25.0 million. We also incurred $2.4 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of $27.4 million. We have hired substantially all of uRoam's 20 employees consisting of product development, sales and service personnel. uRoam's FirePass server is a comprehensive remote access product that enables users to access applications in a secure fashion using industry standard Secured Socket Layer (SSL) technology. The acquisition of uRoam is intended to allow us to quickly enter the SSL Virtual Private Network (VPN) market, broaden our customer base and augment our existing product line.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition, accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141). The purchase price allocation is based on management's best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which, based on facts and circumstances, are subject to change.
As a result of different fiscal year ends of F5 Networks and uRoam, financial information has been combined for different periods in the pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 has been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform uRoam's historical and pro forma amounts to F5 Network's financial statement presentation.
2. Acquisition by F5 Networks
We accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information compiled by management, including an independent valuation, prepared by an independent valuation specialist that utilizes established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry. The purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):
To determine the value of the developed technology, a combination of cost and market approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The market approach measures the fair value of the technology through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. The $3.0 million allocated to developed technology will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years. The $24.2 million allocated to goodwill will not be amortized but will be subject to at least an annual impairment test under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets."

3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflect those matters that are a direct result of the transaction, which are factually supportable and, for pro forma adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations, are expected to have continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are as follows.

(f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any other shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock; or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto, provided, however, that the Company may issue and sell Common Stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock ownership plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company in effect at the Execution Time and the Company may issue Common Stock issuable upon

(e) (i) The Company shall have requested and caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and stating in effect that: (1) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and the pro forma financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
18 (2) on the basis of carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the 2003 meetings of the Company's stockholders, and the Company's board of directors and its committees; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to September 30, 2003, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (x) with respect to the period subsequent to September 30, 2003, there was any change, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt or decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or stockholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the September 30, 2003 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from October 1, 2003, to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding fiscal year in net revenues or in the total or per share amounts of net income or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; or (y) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; (3) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary", "Capitalization", "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7, 11 and 13 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus agrees with the accounting
19 records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation; and (4) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited pro forma financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (the "pro forma financial statements"); carrying out certain specified procedures; inquiries of certain officials of the Company and uRoam, Inc. who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters; and proving the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the pro forma financial statements, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that the pro forma financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such statements. (ii) The Company shall have requested and caused BDO Seidman LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives. (iii) The Company shall have requested and caused the Company's chief financial officer to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the applicable letter. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
20 (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (i) The Securities shall have been listed and admitted and authorized for trading on the Nasdaq National Market, and satisfactory evidence of such actions shall have been provided to the Representatives. (j) At the Execution Time, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a lock-up agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each officer and director of the Company addressed to the Representatives. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancelation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 3330 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304, on the Closing Date. 7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission
21 to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such
22 action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such
23 Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the Nasdaq National Market or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7
24 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancelation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the Citigroup Global Markets Inc. General Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 10013, Attention: General Counsel; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to (206) 272-5556 and confirmed to it at 401 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, Washington 98119, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. 13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings.

F5 Networks today announced net income of $3.8 million ($0.11 per diluted share) on revenue of $36.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, up from $1.4 million ($0.05 per diluted share) on revenue of $31.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003 the company reported net income of $0.5 million ($0.02 per diluted share) on revenue of $27.1 million.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 21, 2004
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's strong performance reflected continuing strength in its core traffic management business across all geographic regions and product lines, which helped boost its first quarter operating margin to 11 percent. Year over year, product revenue grew 35 percent while service revenue increased 28 percent during the same period. In addition, McAdam said sales of the company's recently acquired FirePass SSL VPN technology were stronger than anticipated, accounting for more than 5 percent of product sales.
"During the past several quarters we've seen increasing returns from our ongoing investments in product development and our focus on enterprise customers," McAdam said. "Growing demand for our core products and services is evidence that enterprises are increasingly aware of the benefits of application traffic management in general and the advanced features and functionality that have made BIG-IP a technology and market leader."
In addition to its strong operating results, McAdam said the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSO) fell to 44 days, contributing to positive cash flow of $8.4 million from operations. At December 31, 2003, the company had $205.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, including $113.6 million from its recently completed public offering. For the second quarter of fiscal 2004, McAdam said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $37.0 million to $39.0 million in revenue with net income of $0.13 to $0.15 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks today announced net income of $6.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share) on record revenue of $40.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, up from $3.8 million ($0.11 per diluted share) on revenue of $36.1 million in the first quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003 the company reported net income of $0.8 million ($0.03 per diluted share) on revenue of $28.0 million.
SEATTLE, WAApril 21, 2004
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's revenue growth was driven by strong international sales, which accounted for 45 percent of total revenue. "With the Japanese fiscal year ending in March, the second quarter is typically our strongest in Japan and this quarter was no exception."
In terms of mix, McAdam said both product and service revenue grew sequentially and were up sharply from the second quarter a year ago. "Product revenue, which increased 46 percent year over year, reflects growing demand for our core traffic management products and our FirePass SSL VPN appliances, which accounted for 9 percent of product revenue. In addition, we continue to see improving earnings leverage in our business model, with our operating margin at 14 percent, up from 11 percent in the prior quarter. Service revenue, which grew 42 percent year over year, points to our increasing penetration of the enterprise market and the high rate of service contract renewal in our installed base."
As the company has expanded its share of the enterprise market, McAdam said customers have increasingly recognized the central importance of application traffic management in ensuring the delivery of mission-critical applications to any point in their networks and improving application performance. "A growing number of enterprise customers also see BIG-IP and its position in the network as an ideal platform for additional functionality. As a result, I'm very excited about the upcoming release of our next-generation application traffic management products, which will add new functionality to BIG-IP and deliver major performance improvements in Layer 4/7 processing and SSL acceleration."
 
To ensure a solid financial foundation for its product and business development programs, McAdam said the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSO) fell to 42 days, contributing to positive cash flow of $10.2 million from operations. At March 31, 2004, the company had $227 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2004, McAdam said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $42 million to $44 million in revenue with net income of $0.18 to $0.20 per share.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On May 31, 2004, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks") acquired MagniFire Websystems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MagniFire"), as a wholly-owned subsidiary through a merger transaction. F5 Networks agreed to pay $29 million in cash for all of the issued and outstanding shares of MagniFire capital stock. F5 Networks used existing cash reserves to finance the transaction.
As a result of the merger, F5 Networks acquired all the assets of MagniFire, including MagniFire's web application firewall product line, all plant, equipment or other physical property that MagniFire used in its business and assumed all of the liabilities of MagniFire with the exception of certain liabilities. F5 Networks intends to use the plant, equipment and other physical property of MagniFire consistent with its long-term business objectives. The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and Exhibits
* The financial statements of MagniFire Websystems, Inc. and the pro forma financial information will be filed by an amendment to this form 8-K within 60 days after the date on which this initial report on Form 8-K must be filed.
** The schedules and certain exhibits to the merger agreement have been omitted pursuant to Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A supplemental copy of any omitted schedule will be furnished to the Commission upon request.
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
For the remainder of fiscal 2004, we do not anticipate that revenues from the acquired product line will be material. For fiscal 2005, we believe MagniFire related product sales have the potential to generate revenue in the range of $8 million to $12 million. The acquisition is expected to be approximately $0.02 dilutive to our earnings per share guidance in the current quarter. While we believe MagniFire's operations will be dilutive to earnings for the remainder of fiscal 2004 and the first half of fiscal 2005, we anticipate breakeven results in the third quarter of 2005.
Table of Contents
The terms of the merger are more fully described in the merger agreement attached as exhibit 2.1. to this 8-K report. A press release announcing the completion of the transaction is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

In addition, forward-looking statements regarding revenues from MagniFire products and the effects of the MagniFire acquisition on future net income are subject to the risks that the market for the MagniFire product line will not develop as we anticipate; that a competitive product will be developed that will adversely affect sales; that we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality, technology and other matters, and that the costs of further development and marketing will exceed those that we presently anticipate.

The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. 6.4.3 If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Adverse Consequences that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 10 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if (i) any such claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary losses, any injunctive or other equitable relief, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of the adequacy of the Escrow Fund to provide indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement with respect to such proceeding or (iii) there is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate (in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its reasonable discretion) for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.

If no settlement of such Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Adverse Consequences arising out of any judgment rendered with respect to such claim. Any Adverse Consequences for which an Indemnified Party is 25
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be promptly paid as suffered, incurred or accrued (in accordance with GAAP). If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim which it has the right to assume hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to do so. 6.4.5 In the event that the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 6.4.3, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend or prosecute such claim and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate after giving written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Adverse Consequences incurred in connection with such judgment or settlement. In such case, the Indemnified Party shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party. If no settlement of such Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Adverse Consequences arising out of any judgment rendered with respect to such claim. Any Adverse Consequences for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be promptly paid as suffered, incurred or accrued (in accordance with GAAP). 6.5.

Stockholders on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund, provided, no such withdrawal may be made until all claims of Escrow Amount by Buyer have been satisfied. 6.5.3 A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Representative shall constitute a decision of all the stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise payable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such Target Stockholder.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Alane Moran Holly Hagerman F5 Networks, Inc. Connect Public Relations 206/272-6850 801/373-7888 a.moran@f5.com hollyh@connectpr.com F5 NETWORKS ACQUIRES LEADING WEB SECURITY COMPANY F5 EXECUTES ON ITS PROMISE OF DELIVERING ENTERPRISE APPLICATION SECURITY THROUGH ACQUISITION OF MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS; TRAFFICSHIELD(TM) WEB FIREWALL IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO PROTECT AGAINST APPLICATION LEVEL ATTACKS SEATTLE, JUNE 1, 2004 -- F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), the leading provider of Application Traffic Management products, today announced that it has acquired MagniFire WebSystems, Inc. MagniFire is a technology leader in the web application firewall market and is recognized as a visionary in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Firewalls, 2H03. The $29 million cash transaction for 100% of the equity of MagniFire was signed and closed on May 31, 2004. With this move, F5 is executing on its promise to protect enterprises from malicious application level attacks. Unlike other security products, MagniFire's TrafficShield(TM) security appliance protects against attacks that can circumvent current network perimeter defenses. It combines robust application-layer filtering with best-in-class network and encryption technology for a complete Web security solution that effectively protects against "zero-day" web infrastructure attacks, which are the most costly to businesses. In addition, the TrafficShield product is the only solution that truly supports dynamically changing content, which addresses one of the toughest challenges for web application protection in most corporate applications. By employing optimized real-time software for analysis of traffic at near wire speed, the TrafficShield product is the fastest application protection system available and ensures no impact on the user experience. "As part of our product requirements planning for F5's Application Security Gateway, we solicited input from over 150 enterprises worldwide," said John McAdam, President and CEO of F5 Networks. "These customers have been asking us to apply our expertise in Application Traffic Management toward application security and they helped define the criteria for a best-of-
breed solution. The acquisition of MagniFire gives us immediate access to superior products and technology and TrafficShield's underlying design fits perfectly into F5's overall architecture and product roadmap." The MagniFire acquisition is complementary to F5's successful acquisition of uRoam and its FirePass SSL VPN product for secure remote access, last July. The TrafficShield and FirePass product's web application security capabilities enforce granular web application security policies, creating a complete and reliable solution to protect organizations against any web application (Layer 7) vulnerabilities. As the FirePass product secures user-to-application access, the TrafficShield product ensures that only valid traffic reaches the application. MagniFire's TrafficShield technology implements a positive security model that integrates readily with F5's Application Traffic Management architecture. Unlike network firewall products that focus on protecting against network level attacks, or pure Intrusion Prevention Systems that focus on preventing ever increasing quantities of known attacks, the TrafficShield product allows organizations to easily define what "good traffic" is and apply policies to only allow desired traffic through to web servers and applications. It offers organizations a Web application infrastructure protection system capable of blocking a broad range of network, web infrastructure and web application attacks to enable maximum business-critical transaction throughput at all times. "F5 owns a strategic piece of real estate in the network that sits directly in front of applications and servers, making F5's Application Traffic Management and MagniFire's products an elegant and unmatched solution for application security," said Eitan Bauch, CEO of MagniFire. "F5 is a trusted name in application networking and has a strong track record of leading the market with timely innovations. I'm confident that the combined strength of our people, technologies and products will deliver immediate benefits to the market, while laying a robust and resilient foundation for future needs." In order to induce MagniFire employees to continue their employment following the acquisition, F5 will issue options to acquire up to an aggregate of 415,000 shares of common stock to approximately 20 non-officer MagniFire employees. These options will be granted without shareholder approval pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350 (i)(1)(A)(iv) with the following general terms; each option will have an exercise price equal to fair market value on the grant date, have a ten-year term, and vest over a four year period. Further details about the MagniFire WebSystems acquisition will be discussed in a conference call tomorrow, June 2 at 8:00 a.m. E.T. Call-in numbers: 1-888-323-2712 (US and Canada) and 773-756-4700 (international); conference ID: F5 Call. To listen to the webcast, go to

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Investor Relations John Eldridge (206) 272-6571 j.eldridge@f5.com Public Relations Alane Moran (206) 272-6850 a.moran@f5.com F5 Networks Announces Fiscal Third Quarter Results 16 percent operating margin on record quarterly revenue, up 52 percent year over year SEATTLE, WA -- JULY 21, 2004 -- F5 Networks today announced net income of $7.4 million ($0.20 per diluted share) on record revenue of $44.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2004, up from $6.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share) on revenue of $40.6 million in the second quarter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the company reported net income of $1.4 million ($0.05 per diluted share) on revenue of $29.2 million. F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said sales in North America rebounded during the quarter and combined with strong sales in Europe and Asia Pacific to boost overall revenue 9 percent sequentially and 52 percent year over year. Strength in North America was led by product revenue, which grew 32 percent sequentially and contributed to 24 percent sequential growth of North American product and service revenue combined. As expected, Japan revenue was down sequentially following exceptionally strong sales in the prior quarter and reflecting the seasonality that typically characterizes the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year. McAdam said sales of the company's FirePass SSL VPN products also grew during the third quarter. FirePass revenue of $3.8 million was up from $2.7 million in the prior quarter, pushing revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 to $8.0 million. Steady growth of FirePass sales since the technology was acquired from uRoam in July 2003 is reflected in a recent Infonentics report which ranked FirePass second in global SSL VPN market share. In line with management's guidance, the company did not report any revenue from its newest security offering, TrafficShield, acquired with the purchase of MagniFire on May 31 of this year. McAdam said the company will continue to focus on training and integration during the current quarter, ending September 30, and expects to generate its first material revenue from TrafficShield in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, with a target of $8 to $12 million for the year. Even with the additional operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of MagniFire, the company's revenue growth enabled it to realize further improvements in its operating margin, which increased to 16 percent from 14 percent in the prior quarter. In addition, the company continued to strengthen its
balance sheet, with days sales outstanding (DSO) of 40 days, contributing to positive cash flow of $10.6 million from operations. Following $26.9 million in cash payments related to the purchase of MagniFire, the company had $210 million in cash and investments at June 30. With the launch of its new traffic management products -- code-named "Buffalo Jump" -- scheduled for early September, McAdam said he is confident the new products will have a positive impact on the company's core business and will help drive solid revenue growth in fiscal 2005. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, ending September 30, he said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $45 million to $47 million in revenue. Following F5's strong performance during the past three quarters, management expects to begin recording additional U.S. income taxes and expects to reverse the valuation allowance on the company's U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $5.7 to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter. The estimated net tax benefit includes U.S. federal, state and international taxes. Earnings calculated in a manner consistent with prior quarters are expected to be $0.20 to $0.22 per share. Earnings per share including tax adjustments are expected to be $0.37 to $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter. A reconciliation of the difference between expected earnings before and after the tax adjustment is shown in the following table: RECONCILIATION OF EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS ABOUT F5 NETWORKS F5 enables organizations to successfully deliver business-critical applications and gives them the greatest level of agility to stay ahead of growing business demands.

Item 7. Financial Statements,
Pro Forma
Financial Information and Exhibits
On May 31, 2004, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks") acquired MagniFire Websystems, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("MagniFire") as a wholly-owned subsidiary through a merger transaction. This Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A is filed to provide the financial information with respect to the merger required by Item 7(a) of Form 8-K and the pro forma financial information required by Item 7(b) of Form 8-K.
(a) Financial statements of business acquired
See Exhibit 99.1 for the audited consolidated financial statements of MagniFire as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period July 15, 2000 (date of inception) through December 31, 2003. See Exhibit 99.2 for the unaudited consolidated financial statements of MagniFire as of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, and for the period July 15, 2000 (date of inception) through March 31, 2004.
(b) Pro forma financial information
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements give effect to the acquisition of MagniFire by F5 Networks under the purchase method of accounting and have been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of F5 Networks and MagniFire. Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements. The merger was completed on May 31, 2004.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the merger as if it occurred on March 31, 2004. Integration costs are not included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 and for the six months ended March 31, 2004 have been prepared to reflect the merger as if it occurred on October 1, 2002. There were no material differences between the MagniFire amounts recorded as of March 31, 2004 and the amounts as of the closing date of the merger transaction. The excess of consideration paid by F5 Networks in the acquisition over the fair value of MagniFire identifiable assets and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill.
During the previous fiscal year, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uRoam, Inc. (uRoam). Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 have also been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of uRoam for the period October 1, 2002 through July 23, 2003, the effective date of the uRoam acquisition. Refer to the F5 Networks Current Report on Form 8-K/A as filed with the SEC on September 15, 2003 for additional information related to our acquisition of uRoam.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 combines the consolidated statement of operations of F5 Networks for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 with uRoam's consolidated statement of operations for the period October 1, 2002 through July 23, 2003 and MagniFire's consolidated statement of operations for the calendar year ended December 31, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended March 31, 2004 combines the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of F5 Networks for the six months ended March 31, 2004 with MagniFire's unaudited statement of operations for the six months ended March 31, 2004. As a result of different fiscal year ends, MagniFire's results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2003 were combined with the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004 to conform to the six month period presented for F5 Networks. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, MagniFire recorded no revenue and recorded a net loss of $1.3 million.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information is based on estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have been made solely for purposes of developing this pro forma information, which is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations of future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.

1. Basis of Unaudited Pro Forma Presentation
On May 31, 2004, we acquired MagniFire Websytems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (MagniFire) through a merger transaction. We agreed to pay $29.0 million in cash for all of the issued and outstanding shares of MagniFire capital stock. We also incurred $1.5 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of $30.5 million. As a result of the merger, we acquired all the assets of MagniFire, including MagniFire's web application firewall product line, all property, equipment and other assets that MagniFire used in its business and assumed certain of the liabilities of MagniFire. The acquisition of MagniFire is intended to allow us to quickly enter the web application security market, broaden our customer base and augment our existing product line.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition, accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141). The purchase price allocation is based on management's best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which, based on facts and circumstances are subject to change.
As a result of different fiscal year ends of F5 Networks and MagniFire, financial information has been combined for different periods in the pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the merger had occurred on March 31, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 and for the six months ended March 31, 2004 have been prepared to reflect the acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2002. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform MagniFire's historical and pro forma amounts to F5 Network's financial statement presentation.
2. Acquisition by F5 Networks
We accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information compiled by management, including an independent valuation, prepared by an independent valuation specialist that utilizes established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry. The purchase price allocation as of May 31, 2004, the effective date of the merger transaction, is as follows (in thousands):
Of the total estimated purchase price, $5.0 million was allocated to developed technology. To determine the value of the developed technology, a combination of cost and market approaches were used. The cost approach required an

estimation of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The market approach measures the fair value of the technology through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. The $5.0 million allocated to developed technology will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets," goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually. In the event that we determine that goodwill has been impaired, we will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
The estimated purchase price was allocated to goodwill of $24.8 million, including the Company's valuation allowance on the deferred taxes acquired from MagniFire. We have a full valuation allowance to offset U.S. deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Based on current and expected financial trends, we expect to release the valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. At that time, Goodwill will be increased by an estimated additional $1.0 million to $2.0 million.
3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflect those matters that are a direct result of the merger transaction which are factually supportable and, for pro forma adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations, are expected to have continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are as follows (in thousands):

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from July 15, 2000 (date of inception) through December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. /s/ KOST FORER GABBAY & KASIERER A Member of Ernst & Young Global Tel-Aviv, Israel May 24, 2004 - 2 -

MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 1:- GENERAL a. Magnifire Websystems Inc. (the Company") was incorporated and commenced its operations in the State of Delaware on January 29, 2001. The Company is engaged in the development of solutions for Internet security applications. b. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary was incorporated on November 15, 2000, under the name Magnifire Networks Limited (a British Virgin Islands corporation). Its wholly-owned subsidiary was incorporated and commenced its operations on July 15, 2000, under the name Magnifire Networks (Israel) Limited. c. Magnifire Networks Limited (BVI) repurchased all of its shares from its stockholders on January 30, 2001 and issued 100 shares par value of $ 0.01 each to Magnifire Websystems Inc. (see Note 7c). The Company issued 100% of its issued and outstanding share capital to the stockholders of Magnifire Networks Limited (BVI). d. The Company and its subsidiaries are devoting substantially all of their efforts toward conducting research, development and marketing of their software. The Company's and its subsidiaries' activities also include raising capital and recruiting personnel. In the course of such activities, the Company and its subsidiaries have sustained operating losses and expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future. The Company and its subsidiaries have not generated significant revenues and have not achieved profitable operations or positive cash flows from operations. The Company's accumulated deficit aggregated to $ 9,883 thousand as of December 31, 2003. The Company has a shareholder's deficiency of $ 560 thousand.

NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. a.

MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) b. Foreign currency translation: The functional currency of the Israeli subsidiary is the U.S. dollar, as the U.S. dollar is the primary currency of the economic environment in which the Company has operated and expects to continue to operate in the foreseeable future. The majority of the Company's operations are currently conducted in Israel and most of the Israeli expenses are currently paid in new Israeli shekels ("NIS"); however, most of the expenses are denominated and determined in U.S. dollars. Financing and investing activities including loans, equity transactions and cash investments, are made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of the Financial Accounting Standard Board No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation" ("SFAS No. 52"). All transaction gains and losses of the remeasured monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the statement of operations as financial income or expenses, as appropriate. c. Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. d. Cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments originally purchased with maturities of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. e. Restricted cash: Restricted cash is primarily invested in certificates of deposit, which mature within one year and is used as security for the lease of the Company's office in Israel. f. Inventory: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items, technological obsolesce, excess inventories, discontinued products, and for market prices lower than cost. In 2003, the Company wrote off approximately $ 101 of excess inventory, discontinued products, and for market prices lower than cost, which has been included in cost of revenues. Cost is determined as follows: Raw materials, parts and supplies -using the average cost method with the addition of allocable indirect manufacturing costs. Work-in-progress - cost of manufacturing with the addition of allocable indirect manufacturing costs. - 8 -
MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) Finished products - recorded on the basis of direct manufacturing costs with the addition of allocable indirect manufacturing costs. g. Property and equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, at the following annual rates: % -------------------------- Computers and peripheral equipment 20-33 Office furniture and equipment 7 - 15 Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease The Company and the subsidiary's long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144") whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs. Through December 31, 2003, no impairment losses have been identified. h. Accrued severance pay: The subsidiary's liability for severance pay is calculated pursuant to Israeli severance pay law based on the most recent salary of the employees multiplied by the number of years of employment as of the balance sheet date for all employees. Employees are entitled to one month's salary for each year of employment or apportion thereof. The subsidiary's liability for all of its employees is fully covered by monthly deposits with severance pay funds, insurance policies and by an accrual. The deposited funds include profits accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The value of these policies is recorded as an asset in the Company's balance sheet. The deposited funds include profits accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to Israeli severance pay law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the cash surrendered value of these policies, and includes immaterial profits. Severance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounted to approximately $ 27 and $ 47, respectively. - 9 -
MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) i. Revenue recognition: The Company generates revenues mainly from licensing the rights to use its software products. The Company also generates revenues from maintenance, support, professional services and training. The Company sells its products primarily through its direct sales force. The Company accounts for software sales in accordance with Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition", as amended ("SOP 97-2"). SOP 97-2 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements. In addition the Company has adopted Statement of Position 98-9, "Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions, "("SOP 98-9"). SOP 98-9 requires that revenue be recognized under the "residual method" when Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") of Fair Value exists for all undelivered elements and VSOE does not exist for all of the delivered elements. Under the residual method any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered elements. Revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Maintenance and support revenue included in multiple element arrangements is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance and support agreement. As VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements (maintenance, support and services) is not established, revenues from software license fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance and support services. j. Research and development costs: Research and development costs are charged to the Statement of Operations as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 86 "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed"("SFAS No. 86"), requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Company's product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Costs incurred by the Company between completion of the working models and the point at which the products are ready for general release have been insignificant. Therefore, all research and development costs have been expensed. - 10 -
MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) k. Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiary account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". This Statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company and its subsidiary provide a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. l. Concentrations of credit risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company and its subsidiary to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in major banks in Israel and the United States. Such deposits in the United States may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company's investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments. The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. m. Fair value of financial instruments: The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company and its subsidiary in estimating their fair value disclosures for financial instruments: The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade payables and other accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. Long-term liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current interest rate for loans, of similar terms and maturities. The carrying amount of the long-term liabilities approximates their fair value. - 11 -
MAGNIFIRE WEBSYSTEMS INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) n. Accounting for stock-based compensation: The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Options Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and Interpretation No. 44 "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44") in accounting for its employee stock options plans. Under APB 25, when the exercise price of an employee stock option is equivalent or above the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - transition and disclosure" ("SFAS No. 148"), which amended certain provisions of SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company continues to apply the provisions of APB No. 25, in accounting for stock-based compensation. Pro-forma information regarding net income and loss per share is required by FAS-123, and has been determined assuming the Company had accounted for its employee share options under the fair value method prescribed by that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant, using a minimal value option pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2003 and 2002: risk-free interest rates 1.5%; dividend yields of 0% and a weighted-average expected life of the option of four years for each year. For purposes of pro-forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company's pro-forma information is as follows: The Company applies SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and EITF 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services", with respect to options and warrants issued to non-employees. SFAS No. 123 requires the use of option valuation models to measure the fair value of the options and warrants at the measurement date. - 12 -

The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows.

Through December 31, 2003, Magnifire Websystems Inc. had a U.S. federal net operating loss of approximately $ 2,160, which can be carried forward and offset against taxable income, and which expires during the years 2021-2023. Through December 31, 2003, Magnifire Websystems Ltd. had a net operating loss of approximately $ 7,630. b. Loss before taxes on income consists of the following: - 19 -

Deferred income taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company and its subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows: As of December 31, 2003, the Company and its subsidiaries have provided valuation allowances of $ 3,430, in respect of deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences. Management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the loss carryforwards and other temporary differences will not be realized in the foreseeable future. d. The main reconciling items between the statutory tax rate of the Company and the effective tax rate are the non-recognition of the benefits from accumulated net operating losses carryforward among the various subsidiaries worldwide, due to the uncertainty of the realization of such tax benefits.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAOctober 26, 2004F5 Networks, Inc . (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $50.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up 14 percent from $44.2 million in the prior quarter and 59 percent from $31.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Fourth quarter net income was $15.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share) compared to net income of $7.4 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in the third quarter and net income of $1.4 million ($0.05 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago.
During the quarter, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income and also reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company is presenting pro forma net income for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year to eliminate the impact of these items and report the results in a manner that is comparable to previous periods. Pro forma net income was $10.3 million ($0.28 per diluted share), exceeding the target range ($0.20 to $0.22 per share) set by management in the company's July 21st earnings release.
For fiscal 2004, the company reported record annual revenue of $171.2, up 48 percent from $115.9 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for the year was $33.0 million ($0.92 per diluted share) and pro forma net income was $27.4 million ($0.76 per diluted share) compared to net income of $4.1 million ($0.14 per diluted share) in fiscal 2003. A tabular reconciliation of pro forma differences from actual net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statement of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's record quarterly revenue reflected growing strength in its core business and solid demand for its security products. "During the quarter, overall product and service revenue grew 15 percent and 8 percent respectively, and our gross margin held steady at 77 percent. As a result, the leverage in our business model enabled us to achieve an operating margin of 20 percent, up from 16 percent in the prior quarter and 6 percent in

the fourth quarter of 2003. While our revenue growth derived primarily from strong sales of our core traffic management products and services, we also exceeded both our quarterly and annual revenue targets for our FirePass SSL VPN solution. In addition, we saw a steady ramp in orders for our new generation of BIG-IP products introduced on September 7."
As a result of strong demand for its new products, McAdam said he expects the company's growth to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. "Interest in the new technology and, in particular, the advanced functionality of BIG-IP version 9 has been growing steadily as customers and partners learn about the full-proxy capabilities of our Traffic Management Operating System (TM/OS) and the flexibility of Version 9's modular architecture."
"By nearly any measure, Version 9 is a major leap forward that significantly increases our technology leadership and our competitive edge in application traffic management. Along with major performance enhancements, Version 9 delivers advanced functionality integrated in a modular architecture on a single hardware platform. The capability of TM/OS to inspect and manage bi-directional traffic flows, combined with our powerful new iRules and iControl functionality, dramatically reduces the cost and complexity of implementing critical functions necessary to secure, optimize and deliver mission critical applications. Based on the enthusiastic response from our customers and partners, we believe BIG-IP Version 9 will be the biggest factor driving our growth in fiscal 2005."
In addition to rapid acceptance of F5's new traffic management offerings and continued growth of FirePass, McAdam said he expects TrafficShield, the company's application firewall introduced on October 4, to begin contributing to the company's revenue stream during the current quarter. "With its unique ability to inspect the flow of traffic across multiple packets, TrafficShield's positive security enforcement offers customers protection against application attacks that traditional firewalls and other security devices can't detect or prevent."
For the first quarter of fiscal 2005the first in which the company's earnings will be fully taxed with no offsetting tax benefitMcAdam said the company has set a revenue target of $52 million to $54 million, with net income in the range of $0.20 to $0.21 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, F5 Networks announced revenue of $60.0 million, a 20 percent increase over revenue of $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and a 66 percent increase over revenue of $36.1 million in the first quarter a year ago. The company's operating margin for the quarter was 24 percent, compared to 20 percent in the prior quarter and 11 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 19, 2005
Net income for first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $10.0 million ($0.26 per diluted share).
During the fourth quarter of 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income and also reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in net income of $15.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share), which included a net tax benefit of $5.5 million. To present prior results on a tax-affected basis that is comparable to the current period, the company's financial statements include pro forma earnings for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004. On a pro forma basis, excluding the net tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance and including a 37 percent provision for income taxes, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $6.8 million ($0.18 per diluted share).
In the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the company reported net income of $3.8 million ($0.11 per diluted share). On a pro forma basis, net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $2.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) had the company recorded a 37 percent provision for income taxes.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's strong revenue growth was driven by continuing strength in its core traffic management business across all geographic regions. In addition, McAdam said he believes the recent introduction of the company's new products (the BIG-IP 6400, 3400 and 1500 running version 9 of the BIG-IP software), will expand its growth opportunities by enabling customers to secure, optimize and deliver their applications in ways that go

beyond traditional definitions of application traffic management. Leveraging the full-proxy architecture of the company's new Traffic Management Operating System (TM/OS), BIG-IP's advanced functionality includes delivery and optimization features such as IPv6 translation, universal persistence, error response handling, connection pooling, intelligent compression, L7 rate shaping and TCP optimization, as well as a number of security features, including cookie encryption, resource cloaking, advanced client authentication and selective content encryption.
During the first full quarter of shipment, McAdam said demand for the Version 9 BIG-IP products was strong, with sales of the new platforms accounting for 30 percent of application traffic management revenue.
In addition to continued improvement in profitability, McAdam said, the company's strong revenue growth and leveraged business model enabled it to further strengthen its financial position. During the quarter, collections resulting in 42 days sales outstanding (DSO) contributed to a record $13.5 million in cash from operations and total cash and investments of $254 million at quarter end.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, McAdam said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $63.0 million to $65.0 million in revenue with net income of $0.28 to $0.29 per diluted share.

On February 24, 2005, the shareholders of F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company"), upon recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors, approved the F5 Networks, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Equity Incentive Plan").
Description of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
A maximum of 1,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock is available for issuance under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, combination of shares or similar change to capital structure of the Company. No more than 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued during any fiscal year under stock awards to employees of the Company or its affiliates.
The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock units. The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company unless the Board delegates administration to the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Employees, directors and consultants of the Company are eligible to receive stock awards under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan.
A more detailed summary of the material features of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan is set forth in the Company's proxy statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7, 2005. The summary in the proxy statement and the description of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which is included as part of the proxy statement and filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
Awards under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
On February 24, 2005, each of the non-employee directors was granted options to purchase 7,500 shares of the Company's common stock (subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, merger, combination of shares or similar change to capital structure of the Company) under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Directors receiving option grants were A. Gary Ames, Keith D. Grinstein, Karl D. Guelich, Alan Higginson and Rich Malone. Subject to the director's continuing service with the Company throughout such period, the options vest as to 100% of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date except that in the event of a change in control of the Company, the vesting of 100% of the shares subject to the options will accelerate immediately prior to the change of control. Each option has an exercise price equal to $53.73 per share of common stock (the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant). The term of each option is ten years from the grant date.

The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan: (i) To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how each Stock Award shall be granted; what type or combination of types of Stock Awards shall be granted; the provisions, terms and conditions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical as among Participants or as among types of Stock Awards), including, without limitation: the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive Shares pursuant to a Stock Award, the number of Shares with respect to which a Stock Award shall be granted to each such person, the exercise or purchase price (if any) of a Stock Award, the time or times when Stock Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, any pro rata adjustment to vesting as a result of a Participant's transitioning from full- to part-time service (or vice versa), and any other restriction (including forfeiture restriction), limitation or term of any Stock Award, based in each case on such factors as the Board, in its sole discretion, shall determine; provided, however, that such provisions, terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. (ii) In order to fulfill the purposes of the Plan and without amending the Plan, to modify grants of Stock Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside of the United States in order to recognize differences in local law, tax policies or customs. (iii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the 4
exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective. (iv) To amend the Plan or a Stock Award as provided in Section 12.

(c) DELEGATION TO COMMITTEE. The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees of one or more members of the Board, and the term "Committee" shall apply to any person or persons to whom such authority has been delegated. In the discretion of the Board, the Committee may consist solely of two or more Outside Directors, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, and/or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3, and/or solely of two or more Independent Directors under applicable Nasdaq (or other exchange) rules. The Board or the Committee may further delegate its authority and responsibilities under the Plan to an Officer. However, if administration is delegated to an Officer, such Officer may grant Stock Awards only within guidelines established by the Board or the Committee, and only the Board or the Committee may make a Stock Award to an Officer or Director. If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board shall thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee, or an Officer to whom authority has been delegated), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board may abolish the Committee at any time and revest in the Board the administration of the Plan, and unless otherwise specified by the Board shall retain any authority granted to a committee or individual hereunder unto itself. 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. (a) SHARE RESERVE. Subject to the provisions of Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards shall not exceed in the aggregate One Million Seven Hundred Thousand (1,700,000) Shares of Common Stock. (b) SECTION 162(m) LIMITATION ON SHARE NUMBERS. No Employee shall be eligible to be granted Stock Awards covering more than One Million (1,000,000) Shares during any fiscal year of the Company. (c) REVERSION OF SHARES TO THE SHARE RESERVE. If any Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the Shares not acquired under such Stock Award shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. Further, if any previously-issued Shares are forfeited under the terms and conditions of the Stock Award, then any Shares so forfeited shall revert to and again become 5
available for issuance under the Plan. The provisions of this Section 4(c) are qualified by Section 4(a) such that the total number of Shares issued and outstanding under the Plan at any time may not exceed the number set forth in Section 4(a) (as adjusted under Section 11). (d) SOURCE OF SHARES. The stock subject to the Plan may be unissued Shares or reacquired Shares, bought on the market or otherwise. 5. ELIGIBILITY. Stock Awards may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants. 6. OPTION PROVISIONS. Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) TERM. No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted. (b) EXERCISE PRICE OF AN OPTION. The exercise price of each Option shall be at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code. (c) CONSIDERATION. The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash, check or wire transfer at the time the Option is exercised or (ii) at the discretion of the Board at the time of the grant of the Option or subsequently by (1) by delivery to the Company of other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option is exercised, provided that in the case of Shares acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, such Shares must have been owned by the Partcipant for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender (or such other period as may be required to avoid the Company's incurring an adverse accounting charge), (2) if, as of the date of exercise of an Option the Company then is permitting Employees to engage in a "same-day sale" cashless brokered exercise program involving one or more brokers, through such a program that complies with the Applicable Laws (including without limitation the requirements of Regulation T and other applicable regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board) and that ensures prompt delivery to the Company of the amount required to pay the exercise price and any applicable withholding taxes, (3) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board, or (4) any combination of the foregoing methods. In making its determination as to the type of consideration to accept, the Board shall consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company and the Board may, in its sole discretion, refuse to accept a particular form of consideration at the time of any Option exercise. 6
(d) TRANSFERABILITY OF AN OPTION. The Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 6(d), the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. (e) VESTING. (i) GENERALLY. The total number of Shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may, but need not, vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments which may, but need not, be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary. The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of Shares as to which an Option may be exercised. (ii) LEAVE OF ABSENCE. The Board (or any other party to whom such authority has been delegated, including under this Plan) shall have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent the vesting of Options shall be tolled during any unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that in the absence of such determination, vesting of Options shall be tolled during any such unpaid leave (unless otherwise required by the Applicable Laws). In the event of military leave, vesting shall toll during any unpaid portion of such leave, provided that, upon a Participant's returning from military leave (under conditions that would entitle him or her to protection upon such return under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act), he or she shall be given vesting credit with respect to Options to the same extent as would have applied had the Participant continued to provide services to the Company throughout the leave on the same terms as he or she was providing services immediately prior to such leave. (f) TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Participant's death or Disability), the Participant may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate. (g) EXTENSION OF TERMINATION DATE. Following the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service (other than upon the Participant's death or Disability), if the Participant would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of Shares would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act or violate any prohibition on trading on the basis of possession of material nonpublic information involving the Company and its business, 7
then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in subsection 6(a), or (ii) the expiration of a period of three (3) months after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such requirements. (h) DISABILITY OF PARTICIPANT. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (i) DEATH OF PARTICIPANT. In the event (i) an Participant's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant's death or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service for a reason other than death, then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of death) by the Participant's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option upon the Participant's death pursuant to subsection 6(d), but only within the period ending on the earlier of (1) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement) or (2) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (j) EXERCISE GENERALLY. Options shall be considered exercised when the Company (or its authorized agent) receives (i) written or electronic notice from the person entitled to exercise the Option of intent to exercise a specific number of Shares, (ii) full payment or appropriate provision for payment in a form and method acceptable to the Board or Committee, for the Shares being exercised, and (iii) if applicable, payment or appropriate provision for payment of any withholding taxes due on exercise. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. The Option may, at the discretion of the Board or Committee, include a provision whereby the Participant may elect to exercise the Option as to Shares that are not yet vested. Unvested Shares exercised in such manner may be subject to a Company repurchase right under Section 10(f) or such other restrictions or conditions as the Board or Committee may determine. (k) ADMINISTRATOR DISCRETION. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, the Board or the Committee shall have complete discretion exercisable at any time to (i) extend the period of time for which an Option is to remain exercisable, following the Participant's termination of Continuous Service, but in no event beyond the expiration date for the Option, and (ii) permit the Option to be exercised, during the applicable post-termination exercise period, not 8
only with respect to the number of Shares that were vested on the date of termination, cut also with respect to additional Shares on such terms and conditions as the Board or Committee may determine. 7. PROVISIONS OF STOCK AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS. Each Stock Award Agreement reflecting the issuance of a Stock Unit shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of such agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each such agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) CONSIDERATION. A Stock Unit may be awarded in consideration for such property or services as is permitted under Applicable Law, including for past services actually rendered to the Company or an Affiliate for its benefit. (b) VESTING; RESTRICTIONS. Shares of Common Stock awarded under the agreement reflecting a Stock Unit award may, but need not, be subject to a Share repurchase option, forfeiture restriction or other conditions in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting or lapse schedule to be determined by the Board. (c) TERMINATION OF PARTICIPANT'S CONTINUOUS SERVICE. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates, the Company may reacquire any or all of the Shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not vested or which are otherwise subject to forfeiture or other conditions as of the date of termination under the terms of the agreement. (d) TRANSFERABILITY. Rights to acquire Shares of Common Stock under a Stock Unit agreement shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and Shares of Common Stock issued upon vesting of a Stock Unit shall be issuable during the lifetime of the Participant only to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 7(d), the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to receive Shares of Common Stock issued upon vesting of a Stock Unit. 8. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. (a) AVAILABILITY OF SHARES. During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of Shares of Common Stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards. (b) SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue and sell Shares upon exercise of the Stock Awards; 9
provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Stock Award or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. 9. USE OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK; UNFUNDED PLAN. Proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to Stock Awards shall constitute general funds of the Company. The Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants who are granted Stock Awards hereunder, any such accounts will be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any asset which may at any time be represented by Stock Awards, nor shall this Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company nor any party authorized to administer the Plan be deemed to be a trustee of stock or cash to be awarded under the Plan. Any liability of the Company to any Participant with respect to a Stock Award shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations which may be created by the Plan; no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. Neither the Company nor any party authorized to administer the Plan shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any obligation which may be created by this Plan. 10. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) ACCELERATION OF EXERCISABILITY AND VESTING. The Board shall have the power to accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest, become exercisable or be settled in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time at which it may first vest, be exercised or be settled. (b) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. No Participant shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any Shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms. (c) NO EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER SERVICE RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or any Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Participant or other holder of Stock Awards any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Stock Award was granted or shall affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause, (ii) the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant's agreement with the Company or an Affiliate or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the 10
Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be. (d) INVESTMENT ASSURANCES. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Shares under any Stock Award, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring the stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (iii) the issuance of the Shares upon the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (iv) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock. (e) WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS. To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the Participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of Shares under a Stock Award by any of the following means (in addition to the Company's right to withhold from any compensation paid to the Participant by the Company) or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold Shares from the Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered Shares. (f) REPURCHASE LIMITATION. The terms of any repurchase option shall be specified in the Stock Award and may be at Fair Market Value at the time of repurchase, at the original purchase price or on such other terms and conditions as the Board may determine (and as shall be reflected in the Stock Award Agreement). 11
(g) CANCELLATION AND RE-GRANT OF OPTIONS. The Company may not reprice any outstanding Stock Awards under the Plan, including implement any program whereby outstanding Stock Awards will be cancelled and replaced with Stock Awards bearing a lower purchase or exercise price, without first obtaining the approval of the shareholders of the Company; provided however that this Section 10(g) shall in no way limit the Company's ability to adjust Stock Awards as provided under Section 11 below. (h) INTERPRETATION OF PLAN AND STOCK AWARDS. In the event that any provision of the Plan or any Stock Award granted under the Plan is declared to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be reformed, if possible, to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, or otherwise deleted, and the remainder of the terms of the Plan and/or Stock Award shall not be affected to the extent necessary to reform or delete such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision. All questions arising under the Plan or under any Stock Award shall be decided by the Board or the Committee in its or their total and absolute discretion and such decisions shall be final and binding on all parties. (i) ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. Any document required to be delivered under the Plan, including under the Applicable Laws, may be delivered in writing or electronically. Signature may also be electronic if permitted by the Board or the Committee, and if permitted by Applicable Law. (j) ESCROW OF SHARES. To enforce any restriction applicable to Shares issued under the Plan, the Board or the Committee may require a Participant or other holder of such Shares to deposit the certificates representing such Shares, with approved stock powers or other transfer instruments endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent of the Company until the restrictions have lapsed. Such certificates (or other notations representing the Shares) may bear a legend or legends referencing the applicable restrictions. 11. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN STOCK. (a) CAPITALIZATION ADJUSTMENTS. If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award, without the receipt of consideration by the Company (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to subsection 4(a) and the maximum number of securities subject to award to any person pursuant to subsection 4(b), and the outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and number of securities and price per Share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards. The Board, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive, shall make such adjustments. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a transaction "without receipt of consideration" by the Company.) 12
(b) CHANGE IN CONTROL--DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION. In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, then such Stock Awards shall be terminated if not exercised (if applicable) prior to such event. (c) CHANGE IN CONTROL--ASSET SALE, MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR REVERSE MERGER OR ACQUISITION OF STOCK. (i) In the event of (1) a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise, or (4) the direct or indirect acquisition (including by way of a tender or exchange offer) by any person, or persons acting as a group, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, then any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation shall assume any Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar awards (including with respect to a Stock Award an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the shareholders in the transaction described in this subsection 11(c) for those outstanding under the Plan). (ii) For purposes of subsection 11(c) a Stock Award shall be deemed assumed if, following the change in control, the Stock Award confers the right to purchase in accordance with its terms and conditions, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Stock Award immediately prior to the change in control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) to which a holder of a share of Common Stock on the effective date of the change in control was entitled. (iii) Subject to the provisions of any Stock Award Agreement, in the event any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation refuses to assume such Stock Awards or to substitute similar stock awards for those outstanding under the Plan, then with respect to Stock Awards held by Participants whose Continuous Service has not terminated, the vesting of 50% of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised or settled) shall be accelerated in full, and the Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised or settled (if applicable) at or prior to such event. With respect to any other Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan, such Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to such event. (iv) The Board shall at all times have the authority, in its sole discretion, to provide for additional or different vesting, exercisability, settlement or forfeiture conditions with respect to Stock Awards than that reflected in this Section 11(c), provided that its determinations in this regard shall be reflected in the Stock Award Agreement (including in amendments thereto) issued to the affected Participant. 13
12. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN AND STOCK AWARDS. (a) AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the Company to the extent shareholder approval is necessary to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 or any Nasdaq or securities exchange listing requirements. (b) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Board may, in its sole discretion, submit any other amendment to the Plan for shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers. (c) CONTEMPLATED AMENDMENTS. It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide eligible Employees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code or any other Applicable Law. (d) NO IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS. Rights under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (ii) the Participant consents in writing. (e) AMENDMENT OF STOCK AWARDS. The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the terms of any one or more Stock Awards; provided, however, that the rights under any Stock Award shall not be materially impaired by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (ii) the Participant consents in writing. 13.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 20, 2005, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2005. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

99.1 Press Release of F5 Networks, Inc. announcing quarterly earnings dated April 20, 2005.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, F5 Networks announced revenue of $67.7 million, up 13 percent sequentially over revenue of $60.0 million in the first quarter and 67 percent over revenue of $40.7 million in the second quarter a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $12.1 million ($0.31 per diluted share), compared to $10.0 million ($0.26 per diluted share) in the prior quarter.
SEATTLE, WAApril 20, 2005
For the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the company reported net income of $6.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share). However, during the fourth quarter of 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income, and to present the results for prior periods on a tax-affected basis that is comparable to the current period, the company's financial statements include pro forma earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. On a pro forma basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $4.0 million ($0.11 per diluted share) had the company recorded a 37 percent provision for income taxes.
"During the second quarter, we continued to see solid growth across our business," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Demand for our application traffic management products remained strong, and sales of BIG-IP version 9, launched last September, accounted for 47 percent of traffic management revenue. Likewise, strengthening demand for our FirePass SSL VPN products fueled the growth of security revenue to $6.5 million, up 28 percent from the prior quarter."
With gross margins remaining constant at 77 percent, McAdam said a further decline in the company's expense ratio boosted its operating margin to 26 percent, up from 14 percent in the second quarter of last year. In addition, the company's financial position continued to strengthen during the quarter, with record cash flow of $17.6 million from operations contributing to a quarter-end balance of $293 million in cash and investments.
 
F5 Networks Announces Fiscal Second Quarter Results
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2005, ending June 30, McAdam said the company has set a revenue target of $70 million to $72 million, with an earnings target of $0.33 to $0.34 per diluted share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAJune 13, 2005F5 Networks announced today that Steve Coburn, senior vice president of Finance and chief financial officer, plans to resign from the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Coburn, who joined the company in June 2001, said his decision was based on personal considerations and that he has no immediate plans to seek other employment.
"When I took on my responsibilities as F5's CFO in the summer of 2001 it was a challenging time for the company," Coburn said. "During the subsequent four years, I've had the privilege of working with an exceptional executive team that has succeeded in building a highly effective business model and has put the company on a solid growth track. Among the accomplishments I am personally proud of is developing a strong and flexible Finance organization with the talent, expertise and discipline necessary to manage the financial aspects of the business and support the company's continued growth. Having done that, I believe it's an opportune time for me to begin a transition I've contemplated for some time."
Commenting on the many contributions Coburn has made to the F5 organization, president and chief executive officer John McAdam said those contributions went beyond his responsibilities as CFO. "In addition to Steve's key role in building a solid financial foundation for the company, his oversight of human resources, information technology and investor relations has had a major impact on the company's growth and in raising awareness of F5 in financial markets. Throughout his tenure, I've enjoyed working with Steve personally and professionally, and I will be sorry to see him go. At the same time, I'm confident that the organizations and processes Steve has put in place will make it easy to recruit a strong successor."
With the announcement of Coburn's planned departure, McAdam said he believed it was appropriate to set aside the company's policy of not updating financial guidance for the
 
current quarter. "Although we have three important weeks left in the third quarter, business to date is tracking with our expectations. As we expected, sales in Japan are experiencing seasonal weakness, reflecting the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year, and will be down sequentially from the prior quarter. Also as expected, we have seen strong results in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. As a result, we are reaffirming the revenue and earnings guidance we provided in our second quarter earnings release and conference call on April 20. "
On April 20, the company set a third quarter revenue target of $70 million to $72 million, with an earnings target of $0.33 to $0.34 per diluted share.
"Looking out a bit further," McAdam added, "we continue to see our pipeline of business strengthening as we move toward Q4."
John McAdam and Steve Coburn will hold a conference call today, Monday, June 13, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss the information contained in this release. Call in numbers: 1-800-619-0355 (US and Canada) and 210-234-0001 (international); conference passcode: F5 Networks. To listen to the webcast, go to .

Net income for the quarter was $14.0 million ($0.35 per diluted share), compared to $12.1 million ($0.31 per diluted share) in the prior quarter of fiscal 2005.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 20, 2005
For the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the company reported net income of $7.4 million ($0.20 per diluted share). However, during the fourth quarter of 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income, and to present the results for prior periods on a tax-affected basis that is comparable to the current period, the company's financial statements include pro forma earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. On a pro forma basis, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $4.9 million ($0.13 per diluted share) if the company had recorded a comparable provision for income taxes.
"During the third quarter, the company's revenue growth reflected strong demand for our products in Europe and North America," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Compared to the prior quarter, revenue grew 19 percent in Europe and 25 percent in North America. Year over year, revenue in Europe and North America increased 78 percent and 69 percent respectively. The strength in these regions and solid performance in Asia-Pacific more than offset a slowdown in Japan that is typical of Japan's first fiscal quarter."
With continued revenue growth, stable gross margins, and further improvement in its expense ratio, the company's operating margin was 27 percent in the third quarter, up from 16 percent in the third quarter of last year. Record cash flow of $21.2 million from operations contributed to a quarter-end balance of $329 million in cash and investments, a net increase of $36 million during the quarter.
 
F5 Networks Announces Fiscal Third Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, ending September 30, McAdam said management has set a revenue target of $76 million to $78 million. Effective July 1, the company has voluntarily adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, which would have required it to begin expensing the cost of stock-based compensation in the quarter beginning October 1. Accordingly, McAdam said, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be $0.29 to $0.30 per diluted share, including the charge for stock-based compensation. Excluding the compensation charge, the anticipated earnings range would have been $0.37 to $0.38 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and pro forma earnings is provided in the following table:

     On September 6, 2005, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5") entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Swan Labs Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Swan Labs"), which provides for the acquisition of Swan Labs by F5. Swan Labs is a privately held company located in San Jose, California that provides WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and application acceleration products and services.
     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of F5 will merge with and into Swan Labs, with Swan Labs continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of F5 (the "Merger").

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all stockholders of Swan Labs, other than any stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights under Delaware or California law, will receive at closing an aggregate cash purchase price of $43,000,000. At closing, F5 will deposit $5,375,000 of the cash purchase price in escrow for twelve (12) months as security for various indemnification obligations of the Swan Labs stockholders. All outstanding restricted shares of common stock of Swan Labs and options to purchase shares of common stock of Swan Labs will be accelerated in full prior to the closing of the Merger, and any stock options that remain unexercised will be extinguished upon closing.
     F5 and Swan Labs have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. Closing of the Merger is also subject to customary conditions, including (i) absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties, (iii) delivery of certain third party consents, (iv) acceptance of employment with F5 by certain key employees of Swan Labs, (v) delivery of certain agreements between F5 and certain stockholders of Swan Labs regarding releases of claims and other matters, (vi) satisfaction of various tax matters, and (vii) absence of any material adverse effect on Swan Labs.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
John Eldridge Investor Relations 206/272-6571 j.eldridge@f5.com
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), the leading provider of Application Traffic Management products, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Swan Labs Corporation, a technology leader in the WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and application acceleration market. The $43 million cash transaction for 100% of the equity of Swan Labs was signed on September 6, 2005 and, subject to customary closing conditions, including acceptance of employment with F5 Networks by certain employees of Swan Labs, is expected to close in the first quarter of F5 Networks' 2006 fiscal year. Swan Labs is recognized as a visionary in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Web-Enabled Application Delivery, 2H04.
SEATTLE, SEPTEMBER 6, 2005 
     Swan Labs' WAN optimization and application acceleration technologies extend F5's market leading Application Traffic Management product portfolio. Upon integration, Swan Labs and F5 products together will provide a uniquely powerful enterprise-class solution that is expected to create the only integrated application delivery network to ensure superior performance, security, and availability for all applications  across the WAN and within the LAN.
     "The opportunity to acquire such powerful solutions that nicely round out F5's optimization portfolio was extremely attractive," said John McAdam, President and CEO of F5 Networks. "The acquisition will accelerate the execution of our strategy to deliver application acceleration and WAN optimization for all applications and users. A distinct competitive advantage for us is F5's advanced Traffic Management Operating System that creates a shared
 
application and network services framework that will enable Swan Labs' solution to integrate well into F5's architecture. No other vendor in the market has this powerful capability."
     Upon completion of this acquisition, F5 not only will have access to superior branch office-based and application-specific optimizations through Swan Labs' WANJet solution, but will also gain access to very advanced web application optimization technology in Swan Labs' WebAccelerator solution. When combined, Swan Labs' and F5's solutions will offer an integrated framework that extends application and network security, acceleration and availability to remote, branch, public and private users  regardless of where they are coming from.
     "The marriage of F5 and Swan Labs is a natural fit and will be an exciting and productive move for the industry and customers," said Andrew Foss, CEO of Swan Labs. "F5 and Swan Labs have a parallel strategy of a shared services architecture and our combined solutions will offer enterprises the most advanced and integrated application delivery network."
     Further details about the Swan Labs acquisition will be discussed in a conference call tomorrow, September 7, 2005, at 8:00 a.m. E.T. Call-in numbers: 1-888-552-9191 (US and Canada) and +1-773-756-4632 (international); conference ID: F5 NETWORKS.

B. The Board of Directors of the Company and the requisite number of stockholders of the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law. C.

D. The Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the sole stockholder of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law. E.

AGREEMENT In consideration of the terms hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows: -1-
ARTICLE I - THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, (a) at the Effective Time the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have all the effects of a merger under the laws of the State of Delaware and other applicable law. 1.2 THE CLOSING Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place on the earliest practicable business day (the "CLOSING DATE") after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles IV and V at 10 a.m. local time at the offices of DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP, 701 Fifth Avenue, Suite 7000, Seattle, WA 98104, or such other date, time or location as Parent and the Company shall agree; provided, however, that in no event shall the Closing Date be prior to October 1, 2005. 1.3 EFFECTIVE DATE AND TIME On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") complying with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DELAWARE LAW") to be properly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "DELAWARE SECRETARY OF STATE"). The Merger shall become effective on the date (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") and at the time (the "EFFECTIVE TIME") of filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger as filed. If the Delaware Secretary of State requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to filing or to issuing its certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, as appropriate, will execute any necessary revisions incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement. 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION Unless otherwise specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety as of the Effective Time to conform to the certificate of incorporation attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.4.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.7.2 below, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Company Capital Stock as follows: (i) Each issued and outstanding share of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock (the "COMPANY SERIES A STOCK"), other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration. (ii) Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Common Stock Consideration. (iii) The amount of cash to be paid to each stockholder of the Company under this Section 1.7.1(b) shall be calculated by aggregating all shares of Company Capital Stock held by each such stockholder, so that such amount of cash to be paid shall be equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such -3-
stockholder multiplied by the Per Share Common Stock Consideration, and (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Series A Stock held by such stockholder multiplied by the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.01, with $0.005 being rounded up. (c) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (d) All options, warrants or other outstanding rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Capital Stock (together, the "COMPANY OPTIONS") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with Section 6.11 hereof. 1.7.2 ESCROW Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to effectiveness of the Merger, an aggregate of (a) $4,300,000 in cash (the "BASE ESCROW AMOUNT") and (b) $1,075,000 in cash (the "SPECIAL ESCROW AMOUNT" and, together with the Base Escrow Amount, the "ESCROW AMOUNT") from the Purchase Price shall be deposited in escrow (the "ESCROW") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "ESCROW AGENT"), to be held and administered in accordance with an Escrow Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), such Escrow Amount to be deducted, pro rata based on the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of Company Capital Stock under Section 1.7.1(b), from the aggregate amount otherwise payable to each such holder of Company Capital Stock as of the Effective Time. By approving the Merger at a special meeting of the stockholders or by written consent or by delivering a Letter of Transmittal and their certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.7.4, the stockholders shall agree (i) that the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable to each such stockholder pursuant to Section 1.7.1 shall be reduced by their respective portions of the Escrow Amount, which amounts will be set forth on the Consideration Allocation Certificate, and (ii) to be bound with respect to the indemnification obligations of the stockholders and the procedures set forth in Article VIII. In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will take all steps necessary to enable it or the Surviving Corporation to deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds, all to be managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 1.7.3 APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND DISSENTERS' RIGHTS Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such holder's right for appraisal or rights of dissent of such shares in accordance with California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal or right of dissent ("DISSENTING SHARES"), if any, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but -4-
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or notice of dissent received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand or notice. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand or notice. Each holder of Dissenting Shares (a "DISSENTING Stockholder") who, pursuant to the provisions of California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Company Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of a certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this Section 1.7.3 and this Agreement less the portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder that has been deposited with the Escrow Agent in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.7.2. To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to recover under Article VIII hereof (i) the aggregate amount by which such payment (plus the amounts paid at the Effective Time) exceeds the Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder and (ii) any other costs and expenses, including attorney fees and expenses, incurred in connection with investigating, defending and settling such demands for appraisal (the amounts in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, "EXCESS DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"). 1.7.4 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate an agent (which may be Parent or a subsidiary of Parent) to act as a disbursement or exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger. (b) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall cause to be mailed, no later than 20 days prior to the Closing Date, to each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock and each holder of Company Options: (i) a letter of transmittal (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") containing (A) an agreement to be obligated for such holder's pro rata potion of the indemnification obligations set forth in Article VIII below, and (B) an obligation to execute and deliver the Stockholder Agreement, which document is substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.7.4; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for a portion of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents specified in the Letter of Transmittal, and immediately following the Closing, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or wire transfer representing the portion of the Merger -5-
Consideration that such stockholder of the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.7.1 as of the Effective Time. If any certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the stockholder of the Company claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form satisfactory to Parent, and delivery of the Letter of Transmittal, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the portion of the Merger Consideration that such stockholder of the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.7.1; provided, however, that Parent may in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require such stockholder to provide Parent with an indemnity agreement against any Claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration. Unless otherwise approved by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) shall be delivered only to the Person in whose name the certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable law, including abandoned property, escheat and similar laws. (c) Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to either the making of such payment under the Code or acquiring and/or disposing the shares of Company Capital Stock (through exercise of options or otherwise), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, provided that no amount of Merger Consideration shall be withheld with respect to Taxes arising from the acquisition of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to option exercises unless the Company has failed to comply with applicable Tax withholding requirements in respect thereto. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Company Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding is made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, the stockholders of the Company will provide Parent or the Exchange Agent any Forms W-9 or other certificates or forms required to allow Parent or the Exchange Agent to meet its withholding obligations under the law. 1.7.5 NO FURTHER TRANSFERS After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of any shares of Company Capital Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be forwarded to Parent and shall be cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this Section 1.7, subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to Section 1.7.3. -6-

(b) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, the former stockholders of the Company may, by written consent of the holders of a majority of the former shares of Company Capital Stock (based on the respective ownership amounts immediately prior to the Closing), appoint new representatives as the Stockholder Representatives, including in the event that any Stockholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his capacity as Stockholder Representative, or if any Stockholder Representative resigns as a Stockholder Representative. Written notice, together with a copy of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of the applicable stockholders, must be delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to such appointment. Upon approval of the new representative by Parent, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, such appointment will be effective upon the later of (i) the date indicated in the consent, (ii) the date that Parent approves such new representative or (iii) the date such written consent is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent. -7-

In all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representatives may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the Stockholder Representatives will not be liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder Representatives based on such advice. Except as expressly provided herein, the Stockholder Representatives will not be required to take any action involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to both the Stockholder Representatives. (b) Each stockholder shall severally but not jointly indemnify the Stockholder Representatives and hold the Stockholder Representatives harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on the part of the Stockholder Representatives and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives' duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representatives.

(b) Any Person against whom an Indemnification Claim is being asserted (an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") shall not be obligated to defend and hold harmless any Person claiming indemnification under this Article VIII (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), or otherwise be liable to such Indemnified Party, with respect to any Indemnification Claim made by the Indemnified Party after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time period described in Section 8.1, except that indemnity may be sought after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time limitation if a Claim Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim shall have been delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of such time period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.4, the threshold limits imposed by this Section 8.4(c) shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or in connection with (A) any breach by the Company of Section 2.3 (Capitalization), Section 2.8 (Taxes), Section 2.16 (Intellectual Property), Section 2.25 (Brokers or Finders), or Section 2.6(e) (cash and cash equivalents), (B) any Excess Dissenting Share Payments or any Pre-Closing Taxes, or (C) any intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement, or fraud or similar circumstances.

No Claim for contribution or other Claim, whether under any indemnification agreement or pursuant to general principles of contribution, tort or other liability laws, shall be made by the stockholders of the Company against the Surviving Corporation for any Losses suffered by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with this Article VIII. 8.5 ESTABLISHMENT AND CONTESTING OF INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY (a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "CLAIM NOTICE") of any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against Parent, to Parent and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against the stockholders of the Company, to the Stockholder Representative, reasonably promptly, but in any event (A) prior to expiration of any survival period for such Indemnification Claim and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), within thirty (30) days after assertion of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend or resolve such Indemnification Claim is materially and adversely affected thereby. Any such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which the asserted Indemnification Claim is based, specify the amount of such Indemnification Claim if then ascertainable and, if not then ascertainable, the estimated amount thereof, and shall specify how such Indemnified Party intends to recover such amount pursuant to this Agreement. (b) Unless the Indemnifying Party contests in a writing given to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice that Losses identified in such Claim Notice constitute indemnifiable claims or the amount of such -58-
alleged Losses (a "CONTEST NOTICE"), the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Article VIII, be paid the amount of the Losses related to such Indemnification Claim or the uncontested portion thereof in accordance with Section 8.5(c). An Indemnifying Party shall not object to any Indemnification Claim unless (i) it believes in good faith that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified with respect to the Losses specified therein, or (ii) it lacks sufficient information to assess the validity or amount of the Indemnification Claim or Loses that are in dispute. If the Indemnifying Party objects to an Indemnification Claim on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall promptly request from the Indemnified Party any additional information reasonably necessary for it to assess such Indemnification Claim and the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent the Indemnified Party reasonably can, provide additional information reasonably requested. Upon receipt of such additional information, the Indemnifying Party shall review it as soon as reasonably practicable and notify the Indemnified Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. If a Contest Notice relating to a non-Third Party Claim is given in such time period, and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to reach agreement with respect to any contested Losses within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Contest Notice, the matter shall be settled by binding arbitration in Seattle, Washington as set forth in Section 9.7 below. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cause the arbitrator to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision with respect to such a Contest Notice shall relate solely to whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for the contested Losses, or the contested portion thereof, pursuant to the applicable terms of this Agreement. The final decision of the arbitrator shall be furnished to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in writing and shall constitute the conclusive determination of the issue in question binding upon the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and shall not be contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrator's decision. If a Contest Notice relating to a Third Party Claim is given in such 30-day time period, such Third Party Claim shall be deemed an Open Claim under Section 8.5(d). (c) Upon final determination of the amount of the Losses that is the subject of an Indemnification Claim, whether such determination is the result of an Indemnifying Party's acceptance of, or failure to contest, a Claim Notice, or a resolution of any dispute with respect thereto by agreement of the parties, or a final, non-appealable court order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or pursuant to Section 8.6(c) or otherwise (each, "FINALLY DETERMINED LOSSES"), the Indemnifying Party or parties shall be obligated to pay the amount of such Finally Determined Losses within five (5) days of such final determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Finally Determined Losses that are payable to any Parent Indemnified Party and must be resolved through the Escrow Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in this Article VIII. -59-
8.6 DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. (a) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at any time within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has delivered the Claim Notice for the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard; and provided, further, that the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim. (b) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.6(a) above, the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief or any other Losses upon the Indemnified Party and will not give rise to any increase in any Tax liability of the Parent, the Company, or any of their Affiliates. (c) In the event any of the conditions in Section 8.6(a) is or becomes unsatisfied, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including attorneys fees and expenses), (iii) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any adverse consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article VIII including payment of any judgment or settlement. 8.7 REDUCTION OF ESCROW AMOUNT Any Finally Determined Losses that are payable to any Parent Indemnified Party by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement shall reduce the aggregate Escrow Amount as follows: (i) any Finally Determined Losses arising in connection with any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by the Company in Section 2.16 (an "IP CLAIM"), shall first reduce the Special Escrow Amount until the full amount of the Special Escrow Amount has been paid to the Parent Indemnified Party and then, with respect to any excess Finally Determined Losses owing under an IP Claim or for additional Finally Determined Losses owing under an IP Claims after the Special Escrow Amount has been reduced to zero, the Base Escrow Amount shall be reduced; and (ii) any Finally Determined Losses, other than those resulting from IP Claims, shall reduce only the Base Escrow Amount until the full amount of the Base Escrow -60-
Amount has been paid to the Parent Indemnified Party. In no event shall any Finally Determined Losses arising out of any non-IP Claim reduce the Special Escrow Amount. 8.8 TERMINATION OF ESCROW (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.8 and the Escrow Agreement, upon the date of expiration of the Survival Period (the "ESCROW TERMINATION DATE"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the stockholders of the Company (other than Dissenting Stockholders) any cash remaining in the Escrow. (b) During the pendency of any Indemnification Claim subject to a Claim Notice delivered in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII prior to the expiration of the Survival Period that is the subject of a Contest Notice, unless the Indemnifying Party has assumed all Losses for such Indemnification Claim, then such claim for Losses shall be deemed to be a "OPEN CLAIM." Unless and until an Open Claim becomes a Claim with Finally Determined Losses, the amount of the Losses related to such Open Claim shall not be due or payable. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Person is the Indemnified Party pursuant to an Open Claim and such Claim must be resolved through the Escrow Amount, Parent may instruct the Escrow Agent to reserve the full amount of the Losses set forth in the Claim Notice for such Open Claim from the Base Escrow Amount and/or the Special Escrow Amount (as applicable) pending resolution of such Claim. Any such reserved amount shall remain in the Escrow Amount and be subject to the Escrow until such Claims have been resolved and become Finally Determined Losses. 8.9 EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE Except for Claims based on (a) fraud, (b) a breach of Section 2.3 of this Agreement, (c) any breach of any capitalization representation or any nonsolicitation, noncompetition or release of claims provision in a Stockholder Agreement, (d) any agreement or arrangement related to, arising under or entered into in connection with any employment or consulting relationship with Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates, (e) a breach of any confidentiality provisions contained herein or in any of the Operative Documents, or (f) a breach of Section 1.7, 1.8, 6.9, 6.13 and 6.16 (collectively, "EXCLUDED CLAIMS"), the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII are the sole and exclusive remedy for any matter arising out of, relating to or resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or failure to perform any condition or obligation contained herein or any Operative Document. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof (including the indemnification provisions hereof) in any competent court having jurisdiction over the parties, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity. -61-

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WA  October 25, 2005  F5 Networks, Inc . (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $80.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, up 10 percent from $73.1 million in the prior quarter and 61 percent from $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fourth quarter net income was $15.7 million ($0.39 per diluted share) compared to net income of $15.8 million ($.43 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. For fiscal 2005, the company reported record annual revenue of $281.4 million, up 64 percent from $171.1 million in fiscal 2004. Net income for the year was $51.7 million ($1.34 per diluted share) compared to net income of $32.9 million ($0.92 per diluted share) in fiscal 2004.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company began expensing stock-based compensation. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income and also reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. The company is presenting pro forma annual and fourth quarter net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to eliminate the impact of these items and report net income on a comparable basis.
On a pro forma basis, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $19.0 million ($0.47 per diluted share) compared to net income of $14.0 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the third quarter and $7.3 million ($0.20 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and net income for fiscal 2005 was $55.1 million ($1.42 per diluted share) compared to $18.9 million ($0.52 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004.
A reconciliation of reported net income to pro forma net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's second consecutive year of strong revenue growth resulted from growing demand for application delivery networking products that enhance the security, performance and availability of Web-based applications. "In addition, the
 
introduction of our new TMOS-based products in September 2004 has enabled us to leverage this growing demand by delivering integrated application delivery networking solutions that are demonstrably superior in functionality and performance. Both increasing awareness of the F5 brand and accelerating demand for the new products drove our growth throughout the year and propelled the company to a strong finish, with Q4 product revenue up 67 percent year-over-year."
"With solid sequential revenue growth and gross margin steady at 77 percent, we continued to see further improvements in our operating results during the fourth quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, which we began expensing in Q4, we achieved an operating margin of 31 percent, compared to 27 percent in the prior quarter and 20 percent in the fourth quarter a year ago. On the balance sheet, $32.7 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter helped boost cash and investments to $365 million at year end."
As a result of the growing demand for application delivery networking solutions, coupled with the strength of the company's current offerings and plans for the delivery and integration of new technology, McAdam said he expects the company's growth to continue in fiscal 2006. "Earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of Swan Labs, rounding out our capabilities in application acceleration and WAN optimization. During the current quarter, we expect Swan's products  Web Accelerator and WANJet  to begin contributing to our top-line growth, and over the next 12 months, we plan to migrate both products to TMOS. Also this month, we announced the availability of TrafficShield, our application firewall, as an application security module on BIG-IP, and early customer response to this tightly integrated solution has been very positive."
"Moving ahead into the first quarter of fiscal 2006, I believe F5's technology leadership, strong partnerships, channel leverage, and sound business model will further strengthen our competitive position and enable us to deliver continued sequential growth." For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, McAdam said the company's revenue target is $85 million to $87 million. Earnings for the first quarter are expected to be $0.33 to $0.34 per diluted share, including the charge for stock-based compensation. Excluding the compensation charge, the anticipated earnings range would have been $0.44 to $0.45 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected reported and pro forma earnings is provided in the following table:

Reinland joined F5 in 1998, serving as director of finance and most recently vice president of finance. In that capacity he reported to the company's chief financial officer and held primary responsibility for F5's financial planning and forecasting and for providing direct financial support to the company's business functions. Prior to joining F5, Reinland was chief financial officer for RTIME, Inc., a developer of real-time 3D software for Internet applications, which was acquired by Sony.
Rodriguez joined the company as corporate controller in 2001. In his most recent position as vice president and corporate controller, he has been responsible for the performance of all international and domestic accounting and reporting functions, including SEC compliance. Before coming to F5, Rodriguez was vice president and chief financial officer of CyberSafe, a security solutions company and senior director of finance and operations at Lucent Technologies. Prior to that, he held senior accounting positions in two other Seattle-area high tech companies.
Both Reinland and Rodriguez began their careers as CPA's in public accounting.
John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said that after an exhaustive national search for a candidate to replace the company's former chief financial officer, the decision to divide responsibility for managing the finance department between Reinland
 
and Rodriguez was an easy one. "For the past four years, Andy and John have worked collaboratively to build an efficient and highly effective finance organization that has been instrumental in driving F5's growth and profitability. As head of planning and analysis, Andy has played a key role in shaping a business model that has enabled the company to more than double our revenue during the past two years and post consecutive quarterly improvements in profitability. In his role as corporate controller, John has had primary responsibility for all regulatory and compliance issues, including worldwide implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, and for managing F5's cash and investments, which increased to $350 million in the fiscal year just ended. In their former roles, they worked closely with me and all the members of our executive team. In their new positions as members of that team, I'm confident they will provide both the leadership and support necessary to drive F5's continuing growth and improving profitability."

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, F5 Networks announced revenue of $88.1 million, up 9 percent from $80.6 million in the prior quarter and 47 percent from $60.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income was $15.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share), compared to $15.7 million ($0.39 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $10.0 million ($0.26 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 19, 2006
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company began expensing stock-based compensation. To facilitate a comparison of this quarter's results with the results of prior quarters, the company is presenting pro forma net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of stock compensation expense, net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $19.0 million ($0.47 per diluted share) compared to $19.0 million ($0.47 per diluted share) in the prior quarter.
A reconciliation of reported net income to pro forma net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's revenue growth reflected the continuing strength of its core business and growing demand for its TMOS-based products. Revenue from the company's BIG-IP family of products grew 13 percent sequentially, and demand was strong across all geographic regions. As a result, overall revenue was up sequentially in North America, APAC and EMEA. In Japan, revenue was essentially flat with revenue in the seasonally strong September quarter.
 
Since the completion of the Swan Labs acquisition on October 4, integration of teams and products has proceeded smoothly. Given the incremental expenses related to the Swan integration, McAdam said he was pleased the company managed to maintain its pro forma operating margin at 31 percent, due in part to a higher mix of software revenue that boosted gross margins to 78 percent. In addition, McAdam said, the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew 10 percent to $43.3 million, and $34.5 million in cash flow from operations contributed to a quarter-end balance of $373 million in cash and investments, after paying $43 million (net) in cash for Swan Labs.
Alluding to the continuing strength of F5's core business, McAdam said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $93 million to $95 million in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Earnings for the second quarter are expected to be $0.39 to $0.40 per diluted share, including the charge for stock-based compensation. Excluding the compensation charge, the anticipated earnings range is expected to be $0.49 to $0.50 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and pro forma earnings is provided in the following table:

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 20, 2006, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The attached press release presents certain financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense which would otherwise be required by GAAP. We believe providing these measures exclusive of the impact of stock-based compensation expense, both on a historical basis and with respect to the our guidance, allows investors to compare results and expected results with results for prior periods that did not include stock-based compensation expense. Our management uses these various non-GAAP measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other companies. We have provided reconciliation between our GAAP measures and our non-GAAP measures in the press release.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, F5 Networks announced revenue of $94.1 million, up 7 percent from $88.1 million in the prior quarter and 39 percent from $67.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income was $16.1 million ($0.39 per diluted share), compared to $15.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $12.1 million ($0.31 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
SEATTLE, WAApril 20, 2006
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company began expensing stock-based compensation. To facilitate a comparison of this quarter's results with the results of prior quarters, the company is presenting pro forma net income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006. Excluding stock compensation expense, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $20.3 million ($0.49 per diluted share) compared to pro forma net income $19.0 million ($0.47 per diluted share) in the prior quarter.
A reconciliation of reported net income to pro forma net income is included on the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said revenue during the second quarter grew sequentially in all international regions and across all product categories, including the company's security offerings and its recently acquired WAN optimization and application acceleration products. "As expected, we saw strong growth in Japan, which achieved its highest quarterly revenue to date. In addition, both EMEA and Asia Pacific delivered solid sequential growth.
"The one area where we saw marked softness during the quarter was in our North American business, which was down sequentially due to a slowdown in our US Federal business during the last few weeks of the quarter. Excluding US Federal revenue, North American revenue was up sequentially from the prior quarter."
 
During the third quarter, McAdam said he expects continued sequential growth tempered by seasonal softness that characterizes the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year. Accordingly, management has set a revenue target of $96 million to $98 million and an earnings target of $0.40 to $0.41 per diluted share, including charges for stock-based compensation. Excluding the compensation charges, the anticipated earnings range is expected to be $0.50 to $0.51 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected reported and pro forma earnings is provided in the following table:

Item 8.01 Other Events
On May 24, 2006, a person claiming to be a shareholder of F5 Networks (the "Company") filed a derivative complaint in the Superior Court of Washington, King County, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain current and former executives of the Company and certain current and former members of the Company's Board. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duties between 2000 and 2004 by (i) backdating stock option grants in a manner which was intended to, and did, unduly benefit certain defendants at the expense of the Company, and (ii) knowingly filing false financial statements and other public filings. The complaint also alleges that certain defendants were unjustly enriched by their receipt and retention of the purported backdated stock option grants.
The Company does not intend to file further current reports on Form 8-K describing additional lawsuits, if any, in either federal or state court, which are based on allegations related to the Company's purported backdating of stock option grants.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 20, 2006, F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
(a)   As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has formed a special committee of the Board (the "Special Committee") to conduct a review of the Company's practices relating to the granting of stock options. This review by the Special Committee, which is being assisted by independent legal counsel and forensic accountants, has not yet been completed, and the Special Committee has not communicated any final findings to the Company.
Although this review is ongoing, in the course of furnishing information to the Special Committee, the Company identified at least one occasion on which the accounting measurement date used in the Company's financial statements for option awards granted to certain employees, officers and directors of the Company was different from the accounting measurement date called for under the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ("APB 25"). In order to correct this accounting measurement date error, the Company expects to record an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense related to these options. In addition, because the Company believes that such expense is material under applicable SEC standards, the Company will restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and balance sheets for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006. The Company has not completed its assessment of the amount or effect of any such adjustments. However, any such adjustments are not expected to affect the Company's current cash position or previously reported revenues, but will likely affect the Company's income statements through fiscal 2005 and balance sheets through the present.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
On July 18, 2006 the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") determined, after consultation with management, that the Company's financial statements and all earnings releases and similar communications relating to fiscal periods beginning on or after October 1, 2000, the first day of the Company's fiscal year 2001, should no longer be relied upon. The Company intends to file its restated financial statements as soon as practicable pending completion of the Special Committee's review of the Company's stock option grants and related practices.
The Audit Committee has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; however, as the Special Committee's review has not been completed, the final conclusions of its review are not yet known to the independent registered public accounting firm.
Any additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense recorded for the periods in question would have the effect of decreasing income from operations, net income, and net income per share (basic and diluted) in periods in which the Company reported a profit, and increasing loss from operations, net loss, and net loss per share in periods in which the Company reported a loss. The Company presently believes that additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses under APB 25 will not likely affect the Company's current cash position, or previously reported revenues and will be offset by corresponding increases in additional paid-in capital, thus leaving total shareholders' equity unaffected.
Because the Special Committee's review of the Company's stock option grant practices has not been completed, it is possible that additional issues may be identified for one or more of the periods under review, including the possible findings that the amounts recorded as compensation expense for other options granted in the periods under review should be adjusted. Moreover, the Audit Committee may determine, prior to the completion of the Special Committee's review, that the accounting of other historical stock option grants was incorrect. For this reason, the Company may determine that the financial statements issued by the Company with respect to additional fiscal periods beginning prior to October 1, 2000 should not be relied upon.
Additionally, the Company is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of this situation on its internal controls over financial reporting.
On July 20, 2006, the Company issued a related press release announcing the expected restatement. The full text of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
(d) On July 14, 2006, the Board approved an increase in the number of directors of the Company from six to seven and appointed Deborah Bevier to the Board as a Class II Director to fill the newly created vacancy. Ms. Bevier's term on the Board will expire at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2007. A copy of the press release the Company issued on July 20, 2006 announcing the appointment of Ms. Bevier to the Board is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.2.
In connection with her appointment to the Board, a determination was made that Ms. Bevier is "an independent director as defined by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules (as independence is currently defined in Rules 4200(a)(15) and 4350(d) therein). Ms. Bevier has been appointed to serve on the Special Committee that is reviewing the Company's practices related to stock option grants and related matters. The other member of the Special Committee is A. Gary Ames.

99.1 Press Release of F5 Networks, Inc. dated July 20, 2006 announcing third quarter revenues and an expected restatement.
99.2 Press Release of F5 Networks, Inc. dated July 20, 2006 announcing the appointment of Deborah Bevier to the F5 Board of Directors.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, F5 Networks announced revenue of $100.1 million, up 6 percent from $94.1 million in the prior quarter and 37 percent from $73.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 20, 2006
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said that during the third quarter the company achieved solid sequential growth in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. As expected, Japan revenue was down from the prior quarter, reflecting the seasonal weakness that characterizes the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year. Year over year, Japan revenue grew 72 percent.
During the third quarter, revenue growth was driven by continuing strength in BIG-IP sales and increasing demand for the company's recently acquired WAN optimization products. Reflecting increased competition and ongoing softness in the SSL-VPN market, overall security revenue dipped sequentially, despite a steady ramp in revenue from application security products.
Service revenue for the quarter was $22.9 million, up 7 percent sequentially and 44 percent year over year. Deferred revenue increased 12 percent from the prior quarter to $53.5 million.
For the fourth quarter, ending September 30, 2006, Mr. McAdam said management has set a revenue target of $104 million to $106 million.
Expected Restatement arising from Stock-Based Compensation
As previously announced, a special committee of F5's board of directors has been conducting a review of the company's practices relating to the granting of stock options. This review, which is being assisted by independent legal counsel and forensic accountants, has not yet been completed, and the special committee has not communicated any final findings to the company. However, in the course of furnishing information to the special committee, the company has identified at least one occasion on which the accounting measurement date for option awards granted to certain employees,
 
officers and directors of the company was different from the correct accounting measurement date determined under applicable accounting rules. As a result, the company expects to record an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense related to these options. In addition, because the company believes such expense is material under applicable SEC standards, the company will restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, and for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006. The company has not completed its assessment of the amount or effect of any such adjustments. However, such adjustments are not expected to affect the company's current cash position or previously reported revenues, but will likely affect the company's income statements through fiscal 2005 and balance sheets through the present.
Because the special committee's review of the company's stock option grant practices has not been completed, it is possible that additional issues concerning the company's historical stock option grants could be identified. As a result:
The company intends to publish financial statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, and to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with any restated historical financial statements, as soon as practicable after the completion of the special committee's review.
In light of the expected restatement of the company's financial statements to reflect the additional compensation expense for 2001 option grants described above, and the possibility that the special committee's review may identify the need for additional historical adjustments, the company's financial statements and earnings releases and similar financial communications relating to fiscal periods commencing on or after October 1, 2000, the first day of the company's fiscal year 2001, should no longer be relied upon. Moreover, the company may determine, prior to the completion of the special committee's review, that the accounting of other historical stock option grants was incorrect. For this reason, the company may determine that the financial statements issued with respect to additional fiscal periods beginning prior to October 1, 2000 should not be relied upon.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, F5 achieved revenue of 100.1 million, above our target range of 96 to 98 million. Our book-to-bill ratio was greater than one. Overall, revenue grew $6 million, a quarterly increase of over 6%. Year over year, revenue was up 27 million or 37%. The Americas represented 57% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 20%, A-PAC accounted for 13%, and Japan 10%. Japan revenue was down sequentially as expected, decreasing 29% quarter over quarter. Security revenue, including approximately 1.8 million from our Application Security products, was 7.2 million. This compares to 8 million in the prior quarter and represented 7% of total revenue. Revenue from our WAN optimization and acceleration products was 5.4 million compared to 1.4 million in the prior quarter. Year to date, revenue from these products totaled 7.6 million. Product revenue was 77% of total mix and service revenue was 23%. Deferred revenue increased 5.6 million sequentially to a total of 53.5 million.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL During Q3, we had two greater than 10% distributors, Ingro Micro, which accounted for 14.5% of total revenue, and GE Access, which accounted for 12%. As we announced on May 22nd, F5's board initiated an inquiry into the Company's stock option grant practices. This inquiry is being conducted by a special committee of the board, which is being assisted by independent legal and financial experts. Legal and accounting fees related to this inquiry added approximately 1.8 million in unanticipated operating expenses during Q3. Due to the fact that the special committee's review is ongoing, we have not included financial statements in our Q3 release and we do not expect to file our 10-Q within the required time. That leaves few financial details we are at liberty to discuss until the special committee's review has been completed and appropriate adjustments, if any, have been determined. Without disclosing actual numbers, which may change as a result of any subsequent restatement, I can say that during the third quarter, we achieved pro forma gross margin and pro forma EPS within the target ranges we provided on our second-quarter conference call. As a reminder, these pro forma numbers exclude the effects of stock-based compensation. On the balance sheet, accounts receivable DSO ended the period at 51 days compared to 50 days in the prior quarter. Consistent with our guidance, inventories increased to 7.9 million from 3 million in the prior quarter reflecting our transition to Rojas compliant products for the European Union. At quarter end, we had 453 million in cash and investments. We ended the quarter with approximately 1,010 full-time employees, an increase of 40 employees over the prior quarter. Now for outlook. For the fourth quarter, we feel confident about our ability to continue to grow our business sequentially. As a result, we have set a target revenue range of 104 to 106 million. Although we can't provide guidance on operating expenses in Q4, we do expect to incur additional costs of 4 to 5 million related to our ongoing options inquiry. In addition, we expect an increase of approximately 3 million in stock-based compensation expense resulting from annual awards granted to non-executive employees on July 1st. We estimate DSOs will be consistent with the quarter just ended, around 50 days. We believe inventories will be between 5 and 7 million and we expect to add between 40 and 60 employees during the quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to John McAdam. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I comment on Q3 in some detail, I want to draw your attention to a press release and the comments we issued on the stock option inquiry. Given that the inquiry is still ongoing, we will not be answering any questions related to that subject or providing any more information than is in the press release. I will now comment on Q3, give you some updates on the product road map and comment on Q4 guidance. Business was strong across all our key geographic markets. We saw sequential growth in all our major geographies except Japan. As expected, Japan business was down sequentially from the prior quarter, reflecting the seasonal weakness that characterizes the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year. However, the Japan year-over-year revenue growth was up 72% and exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter. Our U.S. federal business was up sequentially from last quarter but still remains at a relatively low percentage of our overall business, accounting for approximately 3% of overall revenue. U.S. enterprise and service provider business produced very solid sequential growth combined with a very strong contribution from both EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Our service business once more produced sequential growth as well as another large increase in deferred revenue. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 3 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL From a product perspective, we saw a continued sequential growth from our core BIG-IP TMOS platforms, strong sequential growth from our new WAN optimization platforms and strong sequential growth from our TrafficShield application firewall solution. The one product area which was disappointing last quarter was with our FirePass SSL-VPN remote access solution which was down from the previous quarter. We continue to experience ongoing softness in the SSL-VPN market, especially with IP replacement opportunities where customers still do not see a compelling reason to switch architecture from IP SEC with any great urgency. We continue to believe we have a very competitive offering with FirePass and indeed we introduced some exciting new features with version 6 of FirePass last quarter. Features like dynamic application tunnels and increased end-point security checks were added to increase our competitiveness. Dynamic application tunnels offer broad application interoperability, with applications without requiring special administrative privileges on the client. I now want to make some comment on our technology road map before commenting on Q4 guidance. We are now in beta test phase with our new high-end platform, which we will be naming the BIG-IP 8800 on announcement. The platform uses clustered multiprocessing technology which is a key component of the Montreal architecture and provides significant performance gains in all the key areas of Application Delivery Networking. For example, our goal is to double the number of SSL transactions per second available -- available on the current high end flagship 8400 system. This is particularly impressive given that the current 8400 is already best in class from a competitive viewpoint. We continue to believe that our TMOS or traffic management operating system platform continues to give F5 solutions a clear competitive advantage. Our web accelerator solution is the next offering that we plan to add as a software module on the TMOS platform. This strategy of offering Application Delivery Networking optimization and security modules on a single unified platform continues to be well received by our customers and we expect to see similar success with the WebAccelerator module that we have seen with other modules like GTM, our Global Traffic Manager module, and ASM, our Application Security Module based on TrafficShield. As far as Q4 guidance is concerned, Andy provided our target revenue range which will result in continued sequential growth in the final quarter of fiscal 2006. In Q4, we tend to see some softness in EMEA, particularly in the first two summer months, which we believe will result in flat to possibly slightly up sequential -- sequential quarter in that geography. In previous years, we have seen strong sequential growth in Japan in Q4, and we expect that trend to continue this quarter. Also, North America, including federal, is forecasting sequential growth this quarter as well as continued growth in Asia-Pacific. We also expect to see another strong quarter in our services business given the strong deferred revenue service backlog and the high contract renewal rates. Finally, I want to take -- to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their continued support last quarter and with that we'll turn the call over for Q & A. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS OPERATOR [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] Our first question is from Sam Wilson. Your line is open. SAM WILSON - JMP Securities - Analyst Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. First, on the financial statements and the stock options issue. What would you expect the next milestone to be? Would that be the audit committee reporting back to the Company their results? And [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 4 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL then just a generic question. Can you just kind of give a view of the competitive landscape as a change over the last quarter? Thank you. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO On the first one, basically the big milestone will be the report from the independent committee. That's the big one. We don't have a time scale on that. That's obviously independent and we're fully cooperating but no time scale. On the second one, the competitive landscape, not much different from what we've seen for frankly about a year. The two main competitors are Cisco and Sitrix. We think we are in really great shape against them. The 8400, as I mentioned before, is our flagship and our road map's in great shape so from that perspective, we feel very, very good about it. SAM WILSON - JMP Securities - Analyst Terrific. Thank you very much, gentlemen. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Thank you. OPERATOR Ryan Hutchison, your line is open. RYAN HUTCHINSON - W.R. Hambrecht - Analyst Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick clarification and a question. On the pro forma EPS that you provided for the current quarter, that was in line with the guidance you provided, I guess, on last quarter's call. Does that include the -- the legal expenses of 1.8 million? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes, it does. RYAN HUTCHINSON - W.R. Hambrecht - Analyst Okay. And in terms of the question here, on the whole WAN optimization market, clearly you had very strong results here. Can you just talk about any large deals you saw in the quarter, what your expectations are for next quarter in terms of guidance and then just the overall opportunity given it appears that this business has started to actually accelerate quite nicely. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Yes. We -- first of all, we agree the market has definitely got potential and we think it's going to continue to accelerate in general. We did have a fairly large deal in the quarter. We won't get into details on that. We won't talk about particular projects, but we did have one. The pipeline is very strong.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL In terms of the forecast, we don't forecast by product for next quarter and in fact given that this is quarter four, we're coming to the end of the year, we're really not going to change our original guidance, which is clearly very conservative of when we bought Swan Labs, we said we'd do 8 to 10 million. We're obviously very close to that range. But we're not going to give any update on that because it would effectively be an update on the product revenue. RYAN HUTCHINSON - W.R. Hambrecht - Analyst What was the U.S. government business as a percentage of revenue this quarter then? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO It was about 3%. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO For federal was 3. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO For federal, U.S. federal. RYAN HUTCHINSON - W.R. Hambrecht - Analyst Thanks, guys. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Jiong Shao, your line is open. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Thank you. I have a couple of questions as well. First, a follow-up on a prior question. Is the EPS calculation last quarter include the $1.8 million? My calculation -- rough calculation indicated that if you exclude that out, is that a $0.03 difference? Is that --each would have been $0.03 higher? Was my calculation, roughly, right? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Roughly on a tax effective basis, yes, $0.03. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 6 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. So -- okay. That's clear. And my first question is on -- on linearity. I was hoping you could talk about what did you see as you went through the quarter and especially in the last month of the quarter. Did you see any change in overall demand? Is the demand accelerating or decelerating and any color you can provide, that would be helpful. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO On the linearity, actually, this quarter we saw some improvement in the -- in the third month so a little bit better, and we'll continue to put focus on that, but it was actually better this time. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Would you be able to say any -- what the last month -- the percentage of sales in the last month of the quarter? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes. Last quarter was around 50% and this quarter was 47. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay, great. My last question is on the topic of share buyback. I know you didn't say anything today, but -- but as you may know, for example, Juniper could not report numbers as well yesterday but they did announce a share buyback program. So I was wondering from your -- just philosophically, is there any reason because of this investigation you cannot buy back shares? Is there any particular reason or not? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Regarding the buyback, and first of all it's worth reiterating that a strong balance sheet is essential for us because we're competing against Cisco in the Fortune 500 accounts. And also it does -- strong balance sheet with cash gives us some flexibility if we need to make some strategic moves and I'm not by any means implying that we're in the process of doing that. Now, having said that, we did discuss the option of stock buyback at our last board meeting. We decided to delay the decision right now while the inquiry was in place and we intend to revisit that subject at the next scheduled board meeting. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Which is when, John? JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR That's probably going to be in the October time scale. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. Thanks, guys. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 7 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Troy Jensen, your line is open. TROY JENSEN - Piper Jaffray - Analyst Hey, thanks. Just a quick question. Can you give us any sense of maybe what the BIG-IP 8400 contributed this quarter? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO You know, we're not going to break that out but I would characterize it to say we have a good sales on the 8400. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Yes, and our internal expectations but we don't break it out more than just BIG-IP in general. TROY JENSEN - Piper Jaffray - Analyst Got it. That's fine. Let me ask this guys. Last quarter you provided a guidance for revenues but you wanted to grow the backlog a little bit. Is your sense on the backlog where you want it, John, or is it another quarter where we may see our orders grow faster than we see revenues? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Yeah, no. I think we're there in the backlog, actually. I don't know if we'd want to grow it much more. I mean, you can sometimes get customer satisfaction issues if you grow it too big so I think we're up around the number we would expect to be. TROY JENSEN - Piper Jaffray - Analyst Got it. Keep up the good work, guys. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Reanjeannie Chaundra-Thompson, your line is open.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL REANJEANNIE CHAUNDRA-THOMPSON - - Analyst Good afternoon. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the growth. Do you see it more coming from market growth or some of the things you've done with your channel programs in the past year? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO It's really both, actually. I mean the market -- if you look at the markets we're in, we mentioned one -- one optimization is a pretty hot market right now. We think our core market, which is Application Delivery Networking, is a BIG-IP product line is a market that's going to keep growing for the future. But meanwhile, we're continuing to add partners as we do that to take advantage of the market markets so they're both linked together. REANJEANNIE CHAUNDRA-THOMPSON - - Analyst Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question on the WAN optimization. Do you see more coming from your WebAccelerator product or is it mostly WANJet? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO It's mostly WANJet but we do see WebAccelerator business as well but it's mostly WANJet. REANJEANNIE CHAUNDRA-THOMPSON - - Analyst Okay. Great. Thanks so much. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Thank you. OPERATOR Erik Suppiger, your line is open. ERIK SUPPIGER - Pacific Growth Equities - Analyst Good afternoon. Just a couple questions. First off, can we assume that at least one transaction that you've identified as having date issues, can we assume that's in fiscal 2001, since that's the date we're -- where your restatements would start? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Well, you know, I'm just not going to go into any assumptions. We're really going to be pretty hold fast and firm on questions on this and I hope everybody else is listening. That really we're not adding more, given that this is ongoing to what we did in the press release. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 9 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL ERIK SUPPIGER - Pacific Growth Equities - Analyst Can you talk generically, just as to why -- why you would need to restate or why anybody would need to restate so many years if -- you know, if there's an event - -- one-day event or, you know, a single event? JOHN RODRIGUEZ - F5 Networks - SVP, Chief Accounting Officer Erik, this is John Rodriguez. If there's an event where you have a problem with the measurement date, you would amortize that expense over the related vesting period and all those years would be affected. In addition then, any balance sheet would likely be restated as well for any change in a P&L in a prior year. ERIK SUPPIGER - Pacific Growth Equities - Analyst Okay. Then just on the competitive front. Net Scaler's reached probably roughly a quarter of your size at this point. Are you seeing them with -- with greater frequency, or you had said that competitive dynamics haven't changed but they're growing arguably faster in light of their acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about how frequently you're seeing them and what changes there might be on that front? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO We haven't seen many changes at all. DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing This is Dan. I think last quarter on their call yesterday they said that they did about $16 million on the Net Scaler product. So it's growing modestly over there. In terms of what we're seeing in the field in engagements, certainly nowhere outside of North America, and within North America, we see them on occasion. But as John said earlier, really no change in the competitive landscape and when we do engage with them we fare very, very well, thank you. ERIK SUPPIGER - Pacific Growth Equities - Analyst Very good, thank you. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Matt Robinson, your line is open. MATT ROBINSON - Ferris, Baker Watts - Analyst First, I missed the service provider percentage. Can you give me that? And then I've got a couple follow-ups.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes, we didn't -- 19%. We didn't give it but it was 19%. MATT ROBINSON - Ferris, Baker Watts - Analyst That must be why I missed it. Okay. What's the -- what's the population of DevCentral up to at this point? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO DevCentral's up to about 9,000 -- just over 9,500 at this point. MATT ROBINSON - Ferris, Baker Watts - Analyst Okay. And this -- the success you've had with the acquisition, are you -- is that really a function of the -- your sales force getting fully engaged and basically the cycle time for that to ramp, or have you -- or would you say it's markets -- market awareness for more cyclical reasons? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Probably the sales force engaged, getting the whole system integrated into the company. That's probably the big factor. MATT ROBINSON - Ferris, Baker Watts - Analyst And this -- with this 8800 multiprocessor scalability, do you envision that expanding? Are there new applications that you could reach with that kind of capability that you haven't been able to reach before, or is it just the ability to run more applications? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes. There are a couple of different things in play there. One is looking at some of the large service providers and the types of things that they want to do in their environment, being able to divvy the device up between multiple customers being one thing. But more importantly and on a broad scale, adding the enterprise into it as well. Really what it comes down to is how many decisions can you make per second? And people are using this prime real estate to -- to apply these decisions for lots of different outcomes. Acceleration, better security, better availability, so on and so forth across lots of different applications. So what we see in the market place and I think what's demonstrated by things like the population of DevCentral is that the more decision-making power we can provide to people, the more things they soak up with it and they just become more and more creative in how they utilize the products. ERIK SUPPIGER - Pacific Growth Equities - Analyst Thanks. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Thank you. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 11 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL OPERATOR Thank you. Ken Muth, your line is open. KEN MUTH - Baird US Equity Research - Analyst Hi. On the TrafficShield side, what do you think it takes to kind of get that to be a more important contributor to the revenue line? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO I think we're doing a numbers thing from a development perspective and maybe Karl can talk about that in a second. But we're seeing it as a really, really important leverage of our core BIG-IP business now. So our role as a module, the actual -- the price of it is relatively low in the big mix. It's driving a lot of the BIG-IP business. So I wouldn't underestimate that because it's a very, very significant differentiator. But in terms of making it easier to sell and install, Karl can talk about that. KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO Right. So with the -- with the ASM and the TrafficShield product in general, what we found out is that deployment-wise, setting the policy's the most complex part of this, setting these different security policies, and what we've been doing is focusing on simplification of the policies and having more granular control so that not only the people that are security experts in the company can help manage the TrafficShield ASM modules but also just the network administrators and really providing another layer of abstraction so there's been a lot of focus to policy generation, to performance as well as integration into some of the base features of the BIG-IP to help provide, as Dan was referring to, the consolidation of security, acceleration and availability. KEN MUTH - Baird US Equity Research - Analyst Okay. And then the last question on the 8800, when would you expect that to start having revenue contribution? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Well, we haven't given an announcement date on it. It's in beta phase. KEN MUTH - Baird US Equity Research - Analyst Okay. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO It's going well. Typically we wouldn't announce in summer. I mean we typically wouldn't do that. So that gives you some sort of clue as to what we're targeting. But we haven't actually announced it. KEN MUTH - Baird US Equity Research - Analyst Okay. Thank you.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Thanks. OPERATOR Thank you. Alex Henderson, your line is open. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Thanks. Hi, guys. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Hi. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst So just to make sure I got the math right here. It looks like your order growth was sequentially up double digits, am I reading that correctly? Given your book to bill improved from below one to above one. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR No. We didn't -- we didn't say that. Obviously we've grown revenue and we grew our backlog. But it -- and we don't say what we've grown in the backlog. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst It seems pretty clear that your book to bill was solidly below one. You had indicated something in the order of 3 or 4% below one before and now it's above one. Isn't that book to bill somewhat better than you initially anticipated? I thought your guidance last quarter was for the book to bill to go back to one, not to above one. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Well, yes, it was. Absolutely it was. We said assume a 96 to 98 million on a book to bill of one and we produced 100.1 on a book to bill greater than one. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst All right. So on the competitive landscape, lots of noise around the Cisco Blade, at the risk of beating a dead horse a little bit here. Have you had any more opportunity to evaluate the -- the product? Have you gotten your hands on it? Can you talk a little bit about the relative costs if you include not just the cost of the Blade but the cost of a slot on a 60 -- 6500, how that compares with your product? Just give us a little bit more color on what you're thinking about the competitive implications of that product. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 13 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO So I'll drop in just real quick on the competitive situation. We actually had Neval done with an ace against one of -- actually one of our 6800 platforms, not actually our high-end platform. And the customer evaluated both and actually went with us because they said quote unquote that we delivered on our results. And that's about as far as -- that was the exact quote from the customer. So we don't have a Ace module in-house but again we've had one strong trial where we went head to head with the thing. We don't have the results or numbers but that was the comment we got back from the customer. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst And the pricing differential as you see it? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Yes, Alex, this is Dan. In terms of the pricing differential and, again, thinking about things in terms of decisions per second, we far out-performed the - -- huge advantage in the FI products to go with us. The other thing I would comment on as well is we -- in terms of sourcing one internally, we've been waiting for the 16-gig version to be available and that continues not to be available. So we may back off our expectations and go with the 4 or the 8 and start looking at those instead. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst And on the Net Scaler side. Can you talk a little about how you see the continuing drive you have on hardware performance versus what you perceive to be Net Scaler's capability to deliver on hardware improvements on their product, particularly on a scalability basis? KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO Well, I mean Net Scaler's products are really basically off-the-shelf PCs and so they're trying to take advantage of kind of that morse lock curve whereas we've taken a very integrated approach to provide not only the back end processing but up-front and hardware acceleration capabilities and to do this in different form factors so we have -- so we have the 8800 coming here shortly, second half of this year, and that involves elements of all three of those that we're taking full advantage of having a full vertically integrated hardware design group and of course the Montreal platform due out next year extends that even further to provide capabilities that you just can't get off a service class PC. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst One last question then and I'll cede the floor. The deferred -- which I'm assuming you're calling 8800 at this point. KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO Yes, that's right. Correct. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst The timing of the availability of that is still on schedule for, towards the beginning of your new fiscal year?

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO The second half of this year is what we've been forecasting. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO That's what we've been seeing and it's on schedule for that. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst The second half of the calendar year, right? But the schedule hasn't changed at all? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO No. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Okay. Thanks. OPERATOR Thank you. Joanna Makris, your line is open. JOANNA MAKRIS - Adams Harkness & Hill - Analyst Hi there. Wondering what the timing is on the integration of WANJet into TMOS and then secondly if maybe you can talk about some of the initial beta applications and maybe you can talk broadly about the types of applications that people are looking at with the 8800? KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO In terms of schedule for WANJet on top of TMOS, we have broadly been saying next year. We've been clearly focused on integration of the WANJet features, capabilities within the organization, within the sales teams, and F5 productization. But there's definitely plans for next year. And I'm not going to pick a hat just yet but that's definitely on the road map. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO And just to avoid any confusion, WebAccelerator's going to be sooner. KARL TRIEBES - F5 Networks - SVP of Product Development, CTO Right. So we're actually -- WebAccelerator -- thank you for reminding me -- will be available in the second half of this year, okay, as part of TMOS. In terms of what our beta customers are doing, I mean they -- we have a number of betas running right now and these -- we actually pick customers based on the types of things that they -- they are doing and willing to work with us on in terms of the features they are going to test and what we try to do is get a broad cross-section of different features and different [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 15 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL network types, if you will, and application types. So we have customers that are doing everything from stressing some of the core features, such as compression, SSL, caching, to some of the -- to the other features like with the WebAccelerator or some of our other modules that plug into it. So -- DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing And Joanna, this is Dan. Specifically, some of the stuff we've been working on with some of the outstanders are things like Sharepoint and web access with Microsoft to tune WebAccelerator to have very precise settings to get the maximum out of those applications right out of the box. OPERATOR Thank you. Ehud Gelblum, your line is open. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Hi, thank you. Just a couple quick questions if I could. Swan seems to be obviously doing really well and John, clearly will get past your original target. Is there any concentration in the customer base there? Is it concentrated perhaps on a particular geography or in a particular vertical, or is it selling pretty much across an entire large, very diverse customer base? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Yes. It's been selling mainly in North America but that's normal when you do an acquisition. It's obviously easier to ramp up. As we move into next quarter, we expect it to be more widespread across the geographies. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Okay. Great. Thanks. Going back to SSL-VPN for a moment. Can you give us a little more color -- I know you spoke a little bit about it, but to understand - -- you have a handle on how the market is doing around you? Is it not picking up at all for any of your competitors and is it something that at a certain point you'll give up on? Or how do you -- how do you decide how much capital to plow into it? Juniper doesn't seem to be doing very well either. But do you have a sense that this is worth putting your muscle behind or if it doesn't work, that's okay. Whatever color you have. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO I'll pass it down to talk about the market and that's what your original -- in general on the give up question. No, I don't think so. I -- first of all, we really believe, even although there's been a number of courses where we are expecting IP SEC change rate to increase that hasn't happened but there are absolutely good reasons to move from IP SEC to SSL-VPN, especially if you have any mobile requirements and we think over time that's going to happen and the IP SEC market is a pretty strong market and Dan can comment on that. So that's one thing. The other thing is that from a technology perspective, a lot of the technology that we have in FirePass is very, very much embedded in our product road map on an integrated basis. So when we talk about SSL everywhere, where -- where we go from the client rate through to service oriented architectures, FirePass is a key component of that. So we don't -- we don't see any -- any concern about that and in terms of the market, Dan can comment. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 16 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Yes. In -- from calendar Q4 in '05 to calendar Q1 in '06, as reported by Infonetics, the market grew roughly about 1% sequentially, just a hair under 1%. So obviously from that perspective, and that pure SSL-VPN piece, we're not seeing big, big movement there. But just to echo what John said. How this wraps in with our overall road map and our other products, we -- we believe that this will be an important part of our product portfolio for a long time to come. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Right. Do you think -- technology speaking obviously it's very cool and you can do a lot more things with it. Do you think there are there other reasons that the market is strong that are not technology but just based on economically some cost already and there's just perhaps there -- I don't know if there's compatibility with something, I'm thinking VHS Betamax where the better technology doesn't necessarily win? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing I think definitely in terms of the subcosts piece and just people looking at -- I've got something -- it works, yeah, I've got some hiccups with it, some problems. But maybe I'll -- I'm not -- it's not that urgent for me to move off of it. Where we are seeing some people get that sense of urgency are situations where they have focus on things like disaster recovery, things like spinning up access in a hurry into their system. Where the traditional solutions are just very, very painful to -- to try and accommodate that and SSL-VPN technology, especially like FirePass, makes it very fast and easy. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Right. Okay. One last question if I could. Software modules. I know we don't really have a gross margin number to look at because of the impact of it all, but how are the growth or sales of your software modules going? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO They're going well and -- in line with our expectations. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Can you give us a metric? Are they up more this quarter than they were last? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Quarter over quarter, yes. They were. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Yes they were. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Okay. So they've accelerated. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 17 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

OPERATOR Thank you. Manny Recarey, your line is open. MANNY RECAREY - Kaufman Brothers - Analyst I just have one question. Talking about the WAN optimization market. Do you see your growth -- did you -- do you think you're taking market share away from -- from competitors, or do you see it just kind of the overall growth of the market? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO I'll answer it and then again Dan may want to give more detail. It's pretty early to tell that. This is really -- I mean it's our third quarter of revenue but it's really our second quarter of real ramp up and it's just so difficult to say. What -- what we feel very good about is the competitiveness of the product. So when we are competing against some of the strong players, they were doing extremely well. I don't know if we're taking market share or not. DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Yes. It's too early from that perspective. I'd say it's still -- the overall market is increasing. MANNY RECAREY - Kaufman Brothers - Analyst Okay. Thanks. OPERATOR Thank you. Gabe Lowy, your line is open. GABE LOWY - Blaylock & Co. - Analyst Good morning -- good afternoon. It's mostly been answered. The only question is any thoughts or comments on Microsoft's acquisition of Whale? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Yes, it was an interesting one, so Whale being the SSL-VPN piece that they picked up recently. It was picked up just, of course, the name of the team escapes me now, but the Isa Group, sorry. So it's an interesting combination between the two. And I think [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 18 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

But anyway, so it's an interesting move by Microsoft. Our partnership with them continues to be strong across many, many fronts, so it hasn't impacted us in any way. GABE LOWY - Blaylock & Co. - Analyst Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Again if you'd like to ask a question, press star followed by one. The next question is from Brent Bracelin. Your line is open. BRENT BRACELIN - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst Thank you. I have another follow-up question on WANJet, I apologize here, but obviously had to -- pretty good ramp there. You attribute some of it to some large deals in the quarter but as you look at kind of your sales force, the product, what would you attribute the -- the success in that business? Is it having kind of the right architecture that you're having some success there, or are you seeing success in bundling kind of BIG-IP with the Swan Labs, or was the success solely on the kind of Swan Labs only deal? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO We've seen some good examples of bundling BIG-IP, definitely. With scenarios where the competition would have to use BIG-IP or something like it with the customer actually preferring BIG-IP, that gives you an opportunity. But this is so early days. BRENT BRACELIN - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst Sure. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO This is an issue that -- but I think there's going to be some -- some pool of either product. It's also very, very similar in concept to the -- for the channel and -- okay. It's -- it's across the WAN is a content of optimization which of course we do in our core products and the data center with BIG-IP. BRENT BRACELIN - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst And then shifting gears to the telecom market. I know you guys have had a pretty big initiative on the wireline side. Have you guys seen any kind of ramp in the wireline business yet? I know those lead times are pretty long, but any progress report on the wireline side would be appreciated. DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Sorry. This is Dan. Our engagements on the wireline side continue. I think the types of deployments that we're seeing with them are fairly consistent in terms of the types of gateways that we're being deployed with, some of the more advanced voice over [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 19 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial.

So I think those -- those efforts are -- are definitely giving us progress there. We're at 19% of revenue in terms of our overall carrier stuff so we have yet to see that sort of really pull away. But we're positive on it. BRENT BRACELIN - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst So there was no -- you couldn't really comment on the magnitude of the change on the wireline side this quarter versus last quarter? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing No, no, not breaking down. BRENT BRACELIN - Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Jiong Shao, your line is open. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Hi. I got a couple quick follow-ups on the OpEx. Just for the -- for the June quarter, could you talk about if you exclude the legal expense or the rest of the OpEx sort of in line or better or worse vis-a-vis your guidance? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO No. We can't comment on that, I'm afraid. That's why we gave you the pro forma and the range and we gave you the -- the extra, the cost that was included in that pro forma number. But no more than that. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. Okay. Then -- then I was wondering, so for the -- for the September quarter, the first clarification, the 4 to $5 million, that's the total legal expense, not incremental, right? That first clarification. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Now that -- that would be incremental -- oh, incremental from the 1.8? JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Right, right. It's not incremental from 1.8. That's just total. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 20 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO No, that's just total. Legal and accounting fees related to the inquiry. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. Now, if you exclude that, I know in the past you -- you have always said that you -- you aim to grow revenue faster than OpEx in general. Does that still hold sort of as the guidance for the OpEx for next quarter? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Generally the way we've managed the business over the last number of years is going to continue and that's investing behind revenue, investing in the drivers that we believe will grow the top line, and we'll continue to do that. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO We have no -- no intention of -- of changing our approach to the business over the next few quarters. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. One last question is the follow-up on the service provider side. It looks like your service provider, 19% again. That's a -- last quarter was 19% as well. So this seems to be very strong but some of the other wireless vendors appear to have seen some weaker results. Could you just talk about what -- what did you see somewhat differently from what some of the other guys were seeing? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing So this is Dan. I'm not sure in terms of what the other guys were seeing. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst The other wireless application guys. Let's say Openwave, for example, just pick a company. Like sort of the -- the -- the wireless application vendors supplying to the wireless service provider vertical. That vertical doesn't seem to be particularly the strongest quarter but could you maybe comment on the wireless vertical? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO [Inaudible], a big comparison with us. I mean, it's not obvious to -- I mean what we've been doing in -- as we've seen in previous quarters but not much change but progress as we've been having more focus on the service provider. We're building more solutions. We're focusing in areas like set on the voice over IP space, areas like that, mobile being the driver. So no big, big changes. Obviously, a 19% was what it was last quarter so clearly there was growth but it was still the same percentage. And some of the sales cycles are longer. So we're going to keep the same strategy but we haven't seen any sales -- any major difference in that opportunity. JIONG SHAO - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay. Thanks, guys.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO Thanks. OPERATOR Thank you. Alex Henderson, your line is open. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Thanks. So just so that I can get a better handle on what happens beyond the September quarter a little bit. The legal expenses you're talking about in the September quarter, is it reasonable to assume that that's sort of an ongoing quarterly run rate expense until this is resolved? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO No. We can't comment, no, Alex. We can only give you the quarter. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst I mean you put us in an awkward situation of -- of not knowing whether to deal with this expense or not deal with it. It's obviously something that's not forecastable from our perspective. So how -- how should we deal with it if we don't -- is it -- ? Let me put it conceptually. Is it reasonable to think that as long as this process continues that that's the rate of expense? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Alex, we haven't disclosed how long we think that -- ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst I'm not asking that. I'm asking is it that -- is that a rate of expense that's sort of a standard rate as long as it's going? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO We went out to the -- to the people involved with the professionals involved in the investigation and asked them for the best estimate for one quarter only so that's the only information we have on that. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst All right. So -- JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO It's the only information we have, Alex.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst But presumably that's sort of the ongoing cost of associated with doing it on a per quarter. Is that a reasonable way to think about this? I mean otherwise the - -- you need to get the straight on the similar page here. And people need to make some sort of decision on whether they're going to include or not include that expense going forward and obviously you don't want to forecast it. So I'm trying to give you an opportunity to give us at least some indication if that's sort of a standard quarterly run rate? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO I understand where you're coming from. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Just trying to get a handle on the way to think about it. You don't have to give us guidance on it, just an angle on it. JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO We get where you're coming from very clearly but we don't have the information. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Okay. And then can you just refresh what you said about option costs as of July 1st? You made a comment which went by me in the -- when you were reading the text earlier. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes. I -- we expect for the quarter our run rate for stock-based compensation to go up 3 million. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst To go up by 3 million or to 3 million? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO By 3 million. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst By 3 million. ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO By 3 million, yes. We did an awards to non-executive employees on July 1st. [THOMSON LOGO] www.streetevents.com Contact Us 23 (C) 2006 Thomson Financial. Republished with permission.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst And so that is sort of an ongoing rate that we should step it up going out ad infinitum sort of thing, right? ANDY REINLAND - F5 Networks - SVP, CFO Yes, it is. ALEX HENDERSON - Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst Just want to get clarity on that point. Thank you. Thank you. OPERATOR Thank you. Kristi Hime, your line is open. KRISTI HIME - - Analyst Hi. I apologize if I missed this before. I'm assuming you did not say when you expect results of the special committee reviewing stock option grants to be completed? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO That's correct. We don't have that information. KRISTI HIME - - Analyst Okay. And one follow-up. You identified one occasion on which the accounting differed from the correct measurement date. You also said that was involving certain employees, officers and directors. Could you say how many people you're talking about? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO No, and I said at the beginning of this that we are absolutely not going to comment any more information apart from what's in the press release, given that the inquiry's ongoing.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT JUL. 20. 2006 / 4:30PM, FFIV - Q3 2006 F5 NETWORKS EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL OPERATOR Thank you. Again, if you have a question, press star followed by one. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum. Your line is open. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst Hi, a quick question for you. $45 million is a lot of money. Is that just, especially for one quarter, is that just salaries for accountants, attorneys, et cetera, or is that also accruing some for potential damages? JOHN MCADAM - F5 Networks - President, CEO No, it's the former. EHUD GELBLUM - JP Morgan - Analyst It's the former. It's the little people's salaries. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Operator, we're going to take one more question and that'll be it. OPERATOR Thank you. The next question is from Russ Keefe. Your line is open. RUSS KEEFE - - Analyst Yes, hi. In the -- in the WAN optimization market, who do you see as being sort of the leaders within that market? Can you address that a little bit, please? DAN MATTE - F5 Networks - SVP of Marketing Sure. This is Dan. So it's interesting looking at some of the people that are private players out there, folks such as Riverback that are out there. Of course, Juniper picked up Parabit a while back. We see them as well. But I think the most interesting piece of it is really that, just how wide open the market is in general. So whether it's sort of a small private companies looking at the coverage that they're providing or some of the more established players out there. It's still very much a green field opportunity for everybody. JOHN ELDRIDGE - F5 Networks - Director of IR Okay. Thank you all for joining us and if you have any follow-up questions, please give me a call and we'll look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

On August 14, 2006, F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") received a written Staff Determination notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq's Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because the Company has not timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, and that its securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market. The Company issued a press release on August 15, 2006 disclosing its receipt of this notice from Nasdaq. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
As previously disclosed, on July 20, 2006, the Company announced that its filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 would likely be delayed to allow for completion of an ongoing review of the Company's practices related to granting of stock options and related matters by a special committee of the board of directors of the Company. On August 9, 2006, the Company filed a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 (the "Form 12b-25") with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the late filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. The information in the Form 12b-25 is incorporated by reference herein.
The Company intends to request a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to review the Staff Determination notice. Delisting will be stayed pending a decision by the hearing panel. There can be no assurance that the hearing panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 25, 2006, F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") formed a special committee of the Board (the "Special Committee") to conduct a review of the Company's stock option practices. On October 25, 2006, the Company announced that the Special Committee had substantially completed its review.
To date, the Special Committee has found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 through 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes.
The Company is conducting an analysis to determine what adjustments need to be made to the Company's historical financial statements. Based on its analysis to date, the Company anticipates that it may be required to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of up to $30 million, in the aggregate, for fiscal years 1999 through 2006. The Company has not completed its analysis of the total net effect of these adjustments, but any such adjustments are not expected to affect the Company's current cash position or previously reported revenues.
On October 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") determined, after consultation with management, that the Company's financial statements and all earnings releases and similar communications relating to fiscal periods commencing on or after October 1, 1998, which is the first day of the Company's fiscal year 1999, through the date of this report should no longer be relied upon. The Audit Committee also determined that the Company should restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2005 and its financial statements for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006, to reflect adjustments prompted by the Special Committee's findings to date. The Company intends to file its restated financial statements, as well as its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which has been delayed due to the pending the Special Committee inquiry, as soon as practicable pending completion of the Company's analysis of any necessary adjustments.
Additionally, the Company is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of this situation on its internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company will describe any improvements to its policies and procedures regarding the granting of stock options and restricted stock units in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2006.
The Audit Committee has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
On October 25, 2006, the Company issued a related press release announcing the matters described herein. The full text of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, F5 Networks announced revenue of $111.7 million, up 12 percent from $100.1 million in the prior quarter and 39 percent from $80.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue for fiscal 2006 was $394.0 million, up 40 percent from $281.4 million in fiscal 2005.
SEATTLE, WAOctober 25, 2006
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said that during the fourth quarter the company achieved solid sequential growth in Japan, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. EMEA revenue grew 50 percent year-over-year but was down from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal summer slowness in Europe.
The company's strong revenue growth during the quarter and throughout the year was driven primarily by the ongoing strength in its core application delivery networking business. BIG-IP product revenue grew 17 percent sequentially and accounted for 90 percent of total product revenue in the quarter. Combined with strong sequential growth in revenue from security products, the growth of BIG-IP product revenue offset a decline in WAN optimization revenue and drove overall product revenue up 12 percent during the quarter. BIG-IP product revenue represented 89 percent of total product revenue for the year.
Service revenue also grew in the fourth quarter, increasing 11 percent sequentially and pushing deferred revenue up 13 percent from the prior quarter to $60.3 million. During fiscal 2006, service revenue grew 44 percent.
Commenting on the strength of the company's core business, McAdam said he believes it is a result of increasing demand for application delivery networking, as projected by Gartner Group and others, coupled with growing awareness of BIG-IP's superior performance and integrated functionality. "Since we introduced our TMOS-based products more than two years ago, the unique capabilities of those products have been demonstrated again and again in performance benchmarks against our competitors and in other equally important ways. Within the past year, for example, TrafficShield and WebAccelerator, technologies we acquired from MagniFire and Swan Labs respectively, have been migrated to TMOS and made available as software modules running on BIG-IP. At the same time,
 
growing numbers of customers, reflected by the steadily increasing number of registered users on DevCentral (devcentral.f5.com), are writing their own custom features and functions using iRules, a built-in programming language that exploits TMOS's ability to inspect, modify and direct traffic flows going to and from applications.
"Based on the strength of our current pipeline, as well as the market predictions of industry analysts, we believe that demand for application delivery networking will continue to grow throughout fiscal 2007 and that increasing awareness of the F5 brand will continue to drive this growth," McAdam said.
Year over year, product revenue grew 39 percent and service revenue grew 44 percent.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, ending December 31, McAdam said the company expects revenue of between $116 million and $118 million.
Update on Special Committee Review and on Financial Reporting
F5 today announced that the special committee of the board of directors has substantially completed its review of the company's stock option practices since 1997. To date, the special committee has found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 through 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes.
The company is conducting an analysis, in conjunction with the board's audit committee and professional advisors, to determine what adjustments need to be made to the company's historical financial statements. Based on its analysis to date, the company anticipates that it may be required to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of up to $30 million, in the aggregate, for fiscal years 1999 through 2006, to restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2005, and to amend its financial statements for the first half of fiscal 2006. The company has not completed its analysis of the total net effect of these adjustments, but any such adjustments are not expected to affect the company's current cash position or previously reported revenues. Between May 2006 and September 30, 2006, the company spent approximately $7.0 million in legal and accounting fees related to this inquiry.
In light of the expected adjustments described above, the company's financial statements and earnings releases and similar financial communications relating to fiscal periods commencing on or after October 1, 1998, which is the first day of the company's fiscal year 1999, and through the date of this release should no longer be relied upon.
As soon as practicable after completion of any required adjustments, including the adjustments described above, the company intends to file its restated financial statements as well as its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which has been delayed due to the pending special committee inquiry. The company anticipates that the above-described restatements will be completed in time to file its Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 by the required deadline.
 
The company is continuing to cooperate fully with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in their respective inquiries regarding the company's historical stock option practices.

The Company intends to use the Leased Premises, which are located next to the three buildings that currently serve as the Company's corporate headquarters, for general office space. The lease term on the Leased Premises is 10 years, and the Company intends to occupy this new building by fiscal Q2 2008 after construction has been completed. The Company has the option to extend the term of the lease for the Leased Premises for either (a) two terms, each for an additional five year period, or (b) one term, for an additional ten year period. The Company also has a right of first offer to purchase the Leased Premises and the real property on which the Leased Premises is located.
The base annual rent for the Leased Premises will initially be approximately $3.43 million, none of which is due until construction has been completed on the building and the Company has occupied the property. The base annual rent will be increased on each anniversary of the lease commencement date by an amount equal to $1.00 per rentable square foot. In addition to the base rent, the Company will be responsible for payment of certain operating expenses, including utilities and real estate taxes.

2. PREMISES. (A) PREMISES. Landlord does hereby lease to Tenant, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the premises described in Section 1(d) and shown on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Premises"), within the Building described in Section 1(e) and in Section 4(a) below and depicted on Exhibit B hereto (the "Building"), which Building shall be located at 333 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, Washington 98119 on the real property described as follows (the "Property"): Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Block 160 of Seattle Tide Lands, according to the official maps on file in the office of the Commission of public lands in Olympia, Washington. Except any portion thereof lying within the railroad right of way. Upon completion of the Tenant Improvements to the Premises, Landlord shall cause the rentable square footage of the Premises to be measured by Landlord's architect using the BOMA American National Standard Institute Publication, ANSI Z65.1-1996 Standards (the "Rentable Square Footage"), to determine the Building Rentable Area, which measurement shall govern with respect to the Premises Area of Section 1(d). Tenant shall have the right to have a Washington-licensed surveyor approved by Landlord and jointly responsible to Landlord and Tenant verify the Premises Rentable Square Footage determined by Landlord's Architect, if it does so within twenty (20) days after receipt of the notice from Landlord's Architect. If based on such verification Tenant disagrees with the Rentable -3-
Square Footage determined by Landlord's Architect it shall advise Landlord and its Architect of the deviation within ten (10) days thereafter or be deemed to have accepted Landlord's Architect's determination. If Tenant gives a timely notification of disagreement, then the parties shall jointly select a Washington-licensed surveyor or architect to review the calculations of Landlord's architect and the Tenant selected surveyor and make the determination of Premises Rentable Square Footage, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties. (B) COMMON AREAS. As used in this Lease, "Common Areas" shall mean all portions of the Building and Property leased but not demised to specific tenants. During the term of this Lease, Tenant and its licensees, invitees, customers and employees shall have the exclusive right to use the Common Areas, including all parking areas, landscaped areas, entrances, lobbies, elevators, stairs, corridors, and public restrooms, and shall have exclusive control and management of the same. 3. TERM. (A) INITIAL TERM. The Lease Commencement Date shall occur on the latter of the ninetieth (90th) day after the Delivery Date or upon Substantial Completion, as both terms are hereinafter defined, and shall expire on the last day of the one hundred twentieth (120th) full calendar month after the Lease Commencement Date (the "Initial Term"). (B) EARLY POSSESSION. Commencing on the Effective Date, Tenant and Tenant's contractors shall have the non-exclusive right to possess the Premises seven days per week and twenty-four hours per day (the "Early Possession Period") for the purpose of the installation of Tenant's improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and completion of Tenant's Work (as defined in the Tenant Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit C), and to perform such other activities in order to permit and facilitate Tenant's ability to fully occupy and conduct its business on all portions of the Premises as of the Lease Commencement Date. During the Early Possession Period, Tenant shall not be charged Base Monthly Rent, parking charges for stalls located in the Parking Garage or in surface parking lots on the Property, or operating expense charges. Tenant shall coordinate Tenant's Work move-in activities with the contractors working on the site so as not to impede Landlord's Work and the final completion of the Shell and Core Improvements, including punch list type activities. Tenant shall be responsible for the removal and disposal of Tenant's furniture and fixture vendor's cartons and trash. (C) RENEWAL. Provided that Tenant is not then in material default under the terms of this Lease, Tenant shall have the option(s) to renew this Lease for two (2) additional terms of five (5) years each or, if Tenant so elects, for one (1) additional term of ten (10) years (the "Renewal Terms"). If Tenant elects to renew this Lease, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of its intent to exercise such renewal option(s) no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the then existing Lease term; in the event Tenant exercises its right to initially renew for one (1) additional five (5) year Renewal Term (rather than an additional term of ten (10) years), Tenant shall notify Landlord no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the first five (5) year Renewal Term if Tenant elects to renew for an additional five (5) year Renewal Term. All provisions of this Lease shall continue in full force and effect during any Renewal Term, except Base Monthly Rent for the Renewal Term shall be at the then fair market rate (as determined based on the following criteria) for comparable space in a comparable Seattle location taking into account and making appropriate modifications for concessions and costs, such as Tenant improvement allowances, free or -4-
reduced rent periods, construction periods during which rent is not payable and the like, which would be incident to a new lease but that are avoided by Landlord by virtue of the extension of the term of this Lease. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree as to the fair market rent within sixty (60) days following Tenant's notice to Landlord of its intent to renew the Lease, fair market rent shall then be determined by appraisal as follows: Within ten (10) days after expiration of the sixty (60) day period, Landlord and Tenant shall give notice to each other stating the name and address of an impartial person to act as appraiser. Each party's appraiser shall be a licensed commercial real estate broker doing business in Seattle having not less than ten years of active experience as a commercial real estate broker in Seattle, or may be an MAI appraiser with commercial property experience in the Seattle area. The named appraisers shall, together, determine the fair market rent as of the commencement of the particular Renewal Term and according to the standards provided for above herein within thirty (30) days after their appointment. If the two appraisers shall fail to agree upon fair market rent within thirty (30) days of their appointments, and the difference in their conclusions about fair market rent is ten percent (10%) or less of the lower of the two determinations, then fair market rent shall be the average of the two determinations. If the two appraisers fail to agree on fair market rent and the difference between the two determinations exceeds ten percent (10%) of the lower of the two determinations, then the appraisers shall appoint a third appraiser similarly impartial and qualified to determine fair market rent. Such third expert shall determine the market rent within thirty (30) day of his/her appointment and the average of the determinations of the two closest experts shall be final, conclusive and binding on Landlord and Tenant. Landlord and Tenant shall then execute and deliver an amendment to this Lease confirming Base Monthly Rent to be applicable during the particular Renewal Term. Landlord and Tenant shall each pay the fees of any appraiser appointed by Landlord and Tenant respectively, and Landlord and Tenant shall each pay one-half of the fees of any third appraiser appointed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. (D) EARLY TERMINATION. Without limiting any other provisions set forth herein, in the event Tenant vacates its offices in the 401 Elliott Avenue Building, Tenant shall have the one-time right and option to cancel and terminate this Lease effective as of the expiration of the fifth (5th) year of the Initial Term by giving Landlord no less than twelve (12) months prior written notice and paying to Landlord an Early Termination Fee calculated as follows: (i) the unamortized portion of the Tenant Allowance, (ii) the unamortized portion of Pre-Paid Rent for months 12, 24 and 48 of the Initial Term, paid on behalf of Landlord for a portion of the Leasing Fee, and (iii) the unamortized portion of the Rent that would have been payable by Tenant to Landlord on Space Pocket Areas (defined in Section 5(d) below), had no portion of the Premises been designated as a Space Pocket Areas pursuant to Section 5(d), all amortized on a straight-line basis with interest at 8% per annum over the Initial Term, such payment to be made to Landlord no later than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the effective Lease termination date; provided, however, that the Early Termination Fee shall be reduced by the Base Monthly Rent otherwise due, and pre-paid, for the said 72nd month of the Initial Term. 4. DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLETION. (A) DESIGN. Landlord shall cause the Building to be designed, constructed and completed according to the design criteria, specifications and construction standards described on Exhibit D ("Building Shell and Core Outline Specifications"), the architectural, structural and mechanical plans referred to on Exhibit E (the "Plans", which plans are incorporated -5-
herein as if fully set forth) and the floor plans depicted on Exhibit A, each of which Exhibits is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, together with the other terms and conditions of this Lease. Landlord shall provide Tenant true and correct copies of all plans and specifications, and all material modifications thereto as they occur. (B) CONSTRUCTION. The contract(s) for construction of the Building shall impose schedules and deadlines on Landlord's contractor(s) so as to assure timely Substantial Completion and a timely Delivery Date. Whenever the construction schedule is revised, Landlord shall notify Tenant and promptly provide Tenant with a true and correct copy of the revised schedule. (C) PROGRESS. Landlord shall instruct its architect to issue a certificate to Tenant at such times as the Building is at seventy-five percent (75%) and one hundred percent (100%) of Substantial Completion, stating that the completed work fully complies with (i) the plans approved by all necessary governmental agencies and (ii) Exhibits C and D attached hereto. To the extent that City of Seattle inspectors or inspectors for Landlord's construction lender also provide progress certifications, copies of the same shall be provided to Tenant promptly after being received by Landlord. (D) DELIVERY AND COMPLETION. Landlord shall achieve Substantial Completion of the Building and the Premises in accordance with the permitted plans and specifications, and terms of the Exhibits hereto, by no later than January 31, 2008. For purposes of this Lease, "Substantial Completion" means issuance of the final City of Seattle shell and core Certificate of Occupancy for the Building and with respect to each floor of the Building and the parking garage. For purposes of this Lease, "Delivery Date" shall mean the date on which: (1) The Building is fully enclosed and water tight, including the roof and permanent exterior walls and windows; (2) Power and lighting and electrical service are available as described in Exhibit D to the Lease for distribution by Tenant; and (3) There shall be evidence reasonably satisfactory to Tenant that: (i) The balance of the Landlord Work can be completed prior to Lease Commencement; and (ii) The Tenant's contractor is able to proceed efficiently with the Tenant Work, subject to a requirement of reasonable coordination and cooperation with the Landlord's shell and core contractor. (E) LATE DELIVERY. For each day that Delivery Date is delayed past November 1, 2007, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit as provided below against its Rent otherwise first falling due (exclusive of pre-paid rent) under this Lease during the Initial Term, except to the extent any such delay was caused by a Force Majuere Event. A "Force Majeure Event" means only acts of God, strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, inability to procure materials despite commercially reasonable efforts to do so, discovery of archeologically significant artifacts which halt construction, reasonably unforeseen sub-surface conditions materially delaying project excavation, acts of civil or military authorities, fires, floods and earthquakes. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of each delay Landlord contends was caused by a Force Majeure Event within ten (10) business days of its occurrence, describing the impact on the then current construction schedule. -6-
More specifically: (1) In the event the Delivery Date is delayed for up to sixty (60) days past November 1, 2007, then Tenant shall be entitled to rent abatement in an amount equal to two (2) days pro-rata Base Monthly Rent for each one (1) day of such delay; (2) In the event the Delivery Date is delayed for up to an additional one hundred twenty (120) days after December 30, 2007, then Tenant shall be entitled to rent abatement in an amount equal to three (3) days pro-rata Base Monthly Rent for each one (1) day of such additional delay; and (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Delivery Date is delayed past April 29, 2008, or in the event at any time the construction schedule prepared by Landlord's prime contractor or certified by Landlord's architect reasonably indicates the Delivery Date will occur after April 29, 2008, then in either event Tenant may terminate this Lease after thirty (30) days written notice to the Landlord unless the Delivery Date is attained during such thirty (30) day period. (F) LATE COMPLETION. For each day that Substantial Completion is delayed past January 31, 2008, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit as provided below against its Rent otherwise first falling due (exclusive of pre-paid rent) under this Lease during the Initial Term, except to the extent any such delay was caused by a Force Majuere Event. A "Force Majeure Event" means only acts of God, strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, inability to procure materials despite commercially reasonable efforts to do so, discovery of archeologically significant artifacts which halt construction, reasonably unforeseen sub-surface conditions materially delaying project excavation, acts of civil or military authorities, fires, floods and earthquakes. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of each delay Landlord contends was caused by a Force Majeure Event within ten (10) business days of its occurrence, describing the impact on the then current construction schedule. More specifically: (1) In the event Substantial Completion is delayed for up to sixty (60) days past January 31, 2008, then Tenant shall be entitled to rent abatement in an amount equal to two (2) days pro-rata Base Monthly Rent for each one (1) day of such delay; (2) In the event Substantial Completion is delayed for up to an additional one hundred twenty (120) days after March 31, 2008, then Tenant shall be entitled to rent abatement in an amount equal to three (3) days pro-rata Base Monthly Rent for each one (1) day of such additional delay; and (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Substantial Completion is delayed past July 29, 2008, or in the event at any time the construction schedule prepared by Landlord's prime contractor or certified by Landlord's architect reasonably indicates Substantial Completion will occur after July 29, 2008, then in either event Tenant may terminate this Lease after thirty (30) days written notice to the Landlord unless Substantial Completion is attained during such thirty (30) day period. 5. RENT. (A) BASE MONTHLY RENT. Subject to Section 5(d), Tenant shall pay Landlord monthly base rent in the initial amount set forth in Section 1 which shall be payable monthly in advance on the -7-
first day of each and every calendar month ("Base Monthly Rent") beginning on the Lease Commencement Date until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. (B) PRE-PAID RENT. As otherwise provided in Section 37 below herein, upon Broker's certification to Landlord that the Leasing Fee has been paid, Tenant shall be deemed to have paid in full all Base Monthly Rent otherwise due hereunder applicable to months twelve (12), twenty-four (24), forty-eight (48) and seventy-two (72) of the Initial Term hereof. (C) RENT ADJUSTMENT. Base Monthly Rent shall be increased on each anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date by an amount equal to $1.00 per rentable square foot per annum as set forth in Section 1(j). (D) RENT ABATEMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, within thirty (30) days after commencing to conduct business in the Building, Tenant shall have the option to designate up to 20,000 RSF as a space pocket area, which area may be comprised of space located in various areas and floors of the Building as Tenant may select (collectively, the "Space Pocket Area"), thereafter, space pockets may not be switched or otherwise reconfigured. For each of the eighteen (18) months immediately following the Lease Commencement Date, Tenant shall not pay Rent on the Space Pocket Area as long as the Space Pocket Area remains unoccupied by Tenant. Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of its use and occupancy of any portion of the Space Pocket Area, and shall commence paying Rent on each portion of the Space Pocket Area at such time as Tenant occupies such area. Occupancy of any portion of the Space Pocket Area shall mean the date on which Tenant first has an employee actually working in such area. (E) RENT WITHOUT OFFSET AND LATE CHARGE. All Base Monthly Rent shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord without prior notice or demand in advance on the first day of every calendar month, at the address shown in Section 1(c), or such other place as Landlord may designate in writing from time to time. Whether or not so designated, all other sums due from Tenant under this Lease shall constitute Additional Rent, payable without prior notice or demand when specified in this Lease, but if not specified, then within thirty (30) days of demand, during which time the parties will work to resolve any good faith disagreements on the amount due. All Rent shall be paid without any deduction or offset whatsoever except as otherwise specifically provided herein. All Rent shall be paid in lawful currency of the United States of America. Proration of Rent due for any partial month shall be calculated by dividing the number of days in the month for which Rent is due by the actual number of days in that month and multiplying by the applicable monthly rate. Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of any Rent, Additional Rent or other sums due under this Lease will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such cost being extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include, without limitation, processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrance or note secured by the Premises. Therefore, if any Rent or other sum due from Tenant is not received within ten (10) business days of the date due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a sum equal to five percent (5%) of such overdue payment. Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of any such late payment and that the late charge is in addition to any and all remedies available to the Landlord and that the assessment and/or collection of the late charge shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default. -8-
6. USE AND ACCESS. (A) TENANT'S USE. Tenant may use and occupy the Premises for any lawful commercial purpose. Tenant shall have access to the Premises and to the parking 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, including all holidays. Tenant shall promptly comply with all laws, ordinances, orders and regulations affecting the Premises and the Building, including, without limitation, any rules and regulations that may be attached to this Lease and to any reasonable modifications to these rules and regulations as Landlord may adopt from time to time. Tenant will not knowingly use or permit to be used in said Premises anything that will materially increase the rate of insurance on said Building or any part thereof, nor anything that may be dangerous to life or limb; nor in any manner deface or injure said Building or any part thereof; nor overload any floor or part thereof; nor permit any unreasonably objectionable noise or odor to escape or to be emitted from said Premises, or do anything or permit anything to be done upon said Premises in any way tending to create a nuisance or to disturb any other tenant or occupant of any part of said Building. Tenant, at Tenant's expense, will comply with all health, fire and police regulations respecting said Premises. (B) LANDLORD ACCESS. Landlord, its engineer or other agents may retain a pass key to said Premises to enable Landlord to examine the Premises from time to time with reference to any emergency or to the general maintenance of said Premises. In recognition that Tenant will be conducting business that may involve matters of a non-public or confidential nature, if no emergency exists, Landlord shall provide Tenant at least 24 hours notice of any entry into the Premises, and Tenant shall have the right to have a party present during any such entry by Landlord, Landlord's engineer or any other agents. (C) LANDLORD ALTERATIONS. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may from time to time, at its reasonable discretion, make such modifications, alterations, deletions or improvements to the Building as Landlord may deem necessary or desirable, without compensation or notice to Tenant as long as such modifications, alterations, deletions or improvements do not materially alter Tenant's use of its Premises. 7. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. Landlord hereby covenants and warrants to Tenant that the Premises will not contain any Hazardous Material, or if such material does exist, it exists in compliance with all applicable federal, state or local law, and agrees that if during the term of the Lease Hazardous Material not introduced by Tenant is discovered within the Premises, or any state, federal or local governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction requires the removal of any Hazardous Material, Landlord shall at Landlord's expense remove, encapsulate or take other accepted abatement measures with respect to such Hazardous Material in compliance with or as required by all applicable laws, rules and regulations of local, state and federal governmental authorities. Landlord shall defend, indemnify and save Tenant harmless from and against any injuries, claims, accidents, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) arising out of any breach of the foregoing representation and warranty of Landlord. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of the Lease. For purposes of this Section 7, Hazardous Material shall include flammables, explosives, radioactive materials, hazardous wastes or materials, toxic wastes or materials, or other similar substances, petroleum products or derivatives thereof or any substance subject to regulation by or under any federal, state and local laws and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment or the keeping, use or disposition of environmentally hazardous materials, substances, or wastes, -9-
presently in effect or hereafter adopted, all amendments to any of them, and all rules and regulations issued pursuant to any of such laws or ordinances. The parties anticipate that Landlord may be required to conduct certain environmental work at, about or beneath the Building following completion of the Building and commencement of the Initial Term, which may involve monitoring and pumping sub-surface water. Any and all such work shall be the entire responsibility of Landlord to be conducted at Landlord's sole cost and risk including additional water/sewer charges for such water, and without interference to Tenant's quiet enjoyment of the Premises. 8. BUILDING SERVICES, COSTS AND REPAIRS. This is a "triple net", NNN Lease. During the term of this Lease, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of all costs and expenses incurred for electric light and power, heat, air conditioning, elevators, water, sewer, janitorial services, parking services, all building maintenance contracts (except those which are Landlord's responsibility as provided in Section 12 below), recycling and trash removal, window washing, security, landscaping, real estate taxes and insurance, and all other services to the Building. Tenant shall contract directly with utility and service providers for the provision and payment of all such utilities and other services. Landlord shall be fully responsible for the cost of, and shall promptly and regularly perform, all repairs and maintenance to the roof, exterior walls and foundation. To the extent Tenant's repair and maintenance obligations hereunder relate to work performed for or goods supplied to Landlord, Landlord shall assign to Tenant all applicable warranties and service contracts. In the event this Lease is hereafter amended to contract the scope of the Premises, such amendment shall then also provide for pro-ration or separate metering of Tenant's utility/operating/repair costs, taxes to be paid by Tenant and insurance premiums to be paid by Tenant to reflect Tenant's reduced occupancy. 9. TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES. (A) OBLIGATION FOR PAYMENT. Tenant shall pay, satisfy and discharge as the same become due and payable and prior to delinquency all ad valorem real and personal property taxes and assessments and any other taxes or charges levied or imposed upon or against Tenant's proportionate share of the real estate on which the Building is to be situated and/or any improvements now or hereafter made or constructed upon the real estate on which the Building is to be situated (the "Improvements") during the term of this Lease (collectively, "Taxes"). If any Taxes are levied against Landlord or Landlord's property and if Landlord elects to pay the same or if the assessed value of Landlord's property is increased by inclusion of personal property and trade fixtures placed by Tenant in the Premises and Landlord elects to pay the Taxes based on such increase, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand that part of such Taxes for which Tenant is primarily liable hereunder. (B) TAXES PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS. If, by law, any Taxes may, at the option of the taxpayer, be paid in installments (whether or not interest accrues on the unpaid balance of such tax), Tenant may pay such Taxes (and any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of such Taxes) in installments, as they become due during the Term of this Lease. (C) PRORATION OF TAXES FOR PERIOD OTHER THAN TERM. Any Taxes, including Taxes which have been converted into installment payments, relating to a part of a fiscal period of the taxing authority which has been included within the term and a part of which has been included in a period of time prior to the commencement or after the end of the term, shall, whether or not the Taxes are assessed, levied, confirmed, imposed upon or in respect of, -10-
or become a lien upon the Premises, or become payable during the term, be adjusted between Landlord and Tenant as of the commencement or end of the term, so that Tenant will only pay that portion of such Taxes applicable to the term, and Landlord will pay the remainder. (D) RIGHT TO CONTEST TAXES. Tenant shall have the right to contest the amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any Taxes by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted in good faith, only after paying the same or posting such security as Landlord may reasonably require in order to protect the Premises against loss or forfeiture. Upon the termination of any such proceedings, Tenant will pay the amount of such Taxes or part of such Taxes as finally determined to be due and payable, the payment of which may have been deferred during the prosecution of such proceedings, together with any costs, fees, interest, penalties, or other related liabilities. Landlord will not be required to join in any such contest or proceedings unless the provisions of any law or regulations then in effect require that such proceedings be brought by or in the name of Landlord. In that event, Landlord will join in such proceedings or permit them to be brought in its name; however, Landlord will not be subject to any liability for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection with any such contest or proceedings, and Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against and save Landlord harmless from any such costs and expenses. (E) ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS. Should there presently be in effect or should there be enacted during the term of this Lease, any law, statute or ordinance levying any assessments or any tax upon the Premises other than federal or state income taxes, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Tenant's proportionate share of said taxes or assessments at the same time as rental payments. 10. SIGNAGE. Tenant shall have the exclusive right to name the Building the "F5 Building" or such other appropriate name as Tenant may select. Tenant shall have the exclusive right, at Tenant's expense, to place its corporate logo or other identifying signage on the exterior of the Building, the size, location and design of which are depicted on Exhibit B hereto, or as otherwise reasonably approved by Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord hereby approves exterior signage consistent with the size, scope and nature of that currently in place at the 401 Elliott Building. No other sign, picture, advertising or notice shall be displayed, inscribed, painted or affixed to any of the glass or exterior of the Building without the prior approval of Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 11. BUILDING PARKING GARAGE. (A) GRANT OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. Landlord grants to Tenant and Tenant's customers, suppliers, employees and invitees, the exclusive right to use the Building Garage and the surface parking located on the Property. The Building Garage shall contain not less than one hundred twenty-three (123) parking stalls, there shall be not less than twenty-three (23) surface lot parking stalls on the Property, and Landlord shall provide to Tenant not less than one hundred (100) parking stalls at lots located within a two and one-half block radius of the Property (the "Off-Site Parking"). The initial charge will be $125.00 per month per stall for spaces within the Building Garage and $100.00 per month for spaces exterior to the Building Garage. In the event Landlord sells the Building, Landlord will no longer have an obligation to provide the Off-Site Parking. (B) CHARGES. The initial monthly charge for the parking to be provided to Tenant by Landlord shall be the amounts set forth in Section 1(i) of the Lease. Such rate shall be in -11-
effect upon the Commencement Date of the Lease, subject to adjustment during each year of the Lease term based upon comparable parking rates for similar Buildings in the Lower Queen Anne area (reflecting any applicable federal, state and local taxes and levies); provided, however, in no event shall the rates set forth in Section 1(i) be increased during the initial twelve (12) months of the Lease term. Tenant's monthly parking charge for all parking permits and the charges for all validated parking, if any, shall be billed to Tenant and shall be due as Additional Rent within ten (10) days after such billing. 12. MAINTENANCE. Landlord shall maintain and repair, in good condition, the structural parts of the Premises and the Building, which shall include the foundations, bearing and exterior walls (excluding glass), subflooring and roof (excluding skylights), the electrical, plumbing and sewerage systems outside the Building, gutters and downspouts (excluding cleaning, which shall be Tenant's responsibility) on the Building. Except as provided above, Tenant shall maintain and repair the Premises in good condition, including, without limitation, maintaining and repairing all walls, storefronts, floors, ceilings, HVAC systems, interior and exterior doors, exterior and interior windows and fixtures and interior plumbing. Upon expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord in the same condition as existed on the Lease Commencement Date, except for reasonable wear and tear or damage caused by fire or other casualty. Except as provided below, Tenant shall have no obligation to remove Tenant's Work from the Premises at the time Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises to Landlord. 13. ALTERATIONS. Tenant shall have the right to make alterations or additions to the Premises, or construct additional improvements on the Premises, subject to the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that Landlord's prior written consent will not be necessary for any alteration, addition, or improvement of a cosmetic and non-structural nature. All work shall be made with due diligence, in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all laws, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, certificates of occupancy, or other governmental requirements, and provided Tenant shall provide Landlord with thirty (30) days advance notice before commencing such work, excepting the cosmetic work. Title to all improvements constructed or installed by Tenant shall be and remain vested in Tenant during the term of this Lease. All alterations, additions, fixtures, and improvements, whether temporary or permanent in character, made to the Premises by Tenant, will immediately vest in Landlord at the end of the Term of this Lease and will remain on the Premises without compensation to Tenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, all equipment, shelves, bins, machinery and trade fixtures installed by Tenant may be removed by Tenant prior to the termination of this Lease if Tenant so elects, and shall be removed by the date of termination of this Lease or upon earlier vacating of the Premises if required by Landlord; upon any such removal, Tenant shall repair the portion of the Premises from which such equipment, shelves, bins, machinery or trade fixtures were removed. Upon Lease expiration, Tenant shall, upon Landlord's request, remove its cabling from the Premises and the Building. All such removals and restoration shall be accomplished in good workmanlike manner so as not to damage the primary structure or structural qualities of the Buildings and other improvements situated on the Premises. 14. RELEASE AND INDEMNITY. Either party (each as the "Indemnifying Party") will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other from any claim, liability or suit including attorney's fees by any person, persons, and/or entity for any injuries or damages occurring in or about the said Premises or on or about the sidewalk, stairs, or thoroughfares adjacent thereto where said damages or injury was caused by the negligence or intentional act of the Indemnifying Party, its agents, employees, servants, customers or clients. -12-
15. INSURANCE. (A) CASUALTY INSURANCE. Landlord shall, at Tenant's expense, obtain and keep in force, throughout the Initial Term and any Renewal Term(s) of this Lease, a policy or policies of "all-risk" casualty insurance, insuring the Premises against loss or damage by fire or other casualty (including earthquake and flood), naming Tenant and such other parties as Landlord or Tenant may designate as additional insureds as their interests may appear. The amount of such insurance will be not less than the full replacement value of the Building. Tenant shall be provided with full copies of all policies as revised or supplemented from time to time. (B) GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. Landlord shall, at Tenant's expense, obtain and keep in force during the Initial Term and all Renewal Term(s) of this Lease, a policy or policies of general liability insurance with a combined single limit of not less than $1,000,000 for injury to or death of any one person, $100,000 for injury to or death of any number of persons in any one occurrence, and $100,000 for damage to property, insuring against any and all liability of Landlord and Tenant including, without limitation, coverage for contractual liability, broad form property damage, host liquor liability, and non-owned automobile liability, with respect to the Premises or arising out of the maintenance, use, or occupancy of the Premises. Such insurance will be separate from any insurance which may be carried by Tenant and will contain a provision that Tenant, as an additional named insured, will be entitled to recover under the policy for any loss, injury, or damage to Tenant, its agents, and employees, or the property of such persons. (C) PASS-THROUGH PREMIUMS. Tenant shall be responsible for payment of all premiums for insurance provided by Landlord under this section to the extent such premiums are applicable only to the Premises, and shall reimburse Landlord for the same within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's invoice for the same; provided, however, that if Tenant can replace Landlord's insurance provided for herein at a more economical rate to Tenant and otherwise fully consistent with the insurance requirements of this section, Tenant may with the Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, contract directly for such insurance coverage, with Landlord as an additional named insured, in which case Tenant shall no longer be responsible for reimbursement to Landlord for the cost of any insurance Landlord elects to retain. (D) OTHER MATTERS. All insurance required in this paragraph and all renewals of it will be issued by companies authorized to transact business in the State of Washington. All insurance policies shall be subject to approval by Landlord and Tenant as to form and substance, shall expressly provide that such policies shall not be canceled or altered without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord and Tenant and shall, to the extent obtainable, provide that no act or omission of Tenant which would otherwise result in forfeiture or reduction of the insurance will affect or limit the obligation of the insurance company to pay the amount of any loss sustained. Upon issuance each insurance policy, a duplicate or certificate of such policy shall be delivered to Landlord and Tenant. Landlord may satisfy its obligation under this paragraph by appropriate endorsements of its blanket insurance policies. -13-
(E) MUTUAL WAIVER. Landlord and Tenant waive all rights to recover against each other or against any other Tenant or occupant of the Building, or against the officers, directors, shareholders, partners, joint venturers, employees, agents, customers, invitees or business visitors of each of theirs or of any other Tenant or occupant of the Building, for any loss or damage arising from any cause covered by any insurance required to be carried by each of them pursuant to this section or any other insurance actually carried by each of them to the extent actually covered by any such insurance. Landlord and Tenant will cause their respective insurers to issue appropriate waiver of subrogation endorsements to all policies of insurance carried in connection with the Premises, Improvements or the contents of either of them. Tenant will cause all other occupants of the Premises claiming by, under, or through Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord a waiver of claims similar to the waiver in this paragraph and to obtain such waiver of subrogation rights endorsements. 16. DESTRUCTION. If during the Term, more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises are destroyed from any cause, or rendered inaccessible or unusable from any cause, Landlord may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Lease by delivery of notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days of such event without compensation to Tenant. If in Landlord's estimation, the Premises cannot be restored within one hundred eighty (180) days following such destruction, then Landlord shall notify Tenant and Tenant may terminate this Lease by delivery of notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days of receipt of Landlord's notice. If neither Landlord nor Tenant terminates this Lease as provided above, then Landlord shall commence to restore the Premises in compliance with then existing laws and shall complete such restoration with due diligence. In such event, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, but there shall be an abatement of Base Monthly Rent and Tenant's obligation for the payment of expenses under Section 8 above between the date of destruction and the date of completion of restoration, based on the extent to which destruction interferes with Tenant's use of the Premises. 17. CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION. (A) CASUALTY. In the event the leased Premises or the Building is destroyed or injured by fire, earthquake or other casualty to the extent that they are no longer satisfactory for the conduct of Tenant's business, in whole or in part, then Landlord will engage a registered architect to certify within sixty (60) days after such destruction or injury to Landlord and Tenant the amount of time needed to restore the Building and the Premises to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the casualty. If the time needed to so restore the Building and Premises exceeds twelve (12) months from the date of the casualty, then either the Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving the other party such notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the notifying party's receipt of the architect's certificate. If a casualty causes damages to the Building and this Lease is not terminated by either party under the provisions of this section, then Landlord shall diligently rebuild and restore the Building and the Premises. Upon a casualty event, the rent shall be abated equitably on a per diem basis for the portion of the Premises that is unfit for occupancy commencing upon the date of the casualty and ending on the completion of the repair and restoration so as to permit Tenant's full and regular occupancy thereof or the earlier termination of this Lease. During any period of abatement of rent due to casualty or destruction of the Premises, unless this Lease has been terminated, Landlord shall use its best efforts to locate comparable space for Tenant at the fair market rate not to exceed Tenant's rental rate hereunder. Landlord shall not be liable for any consequential damages by reason of inability, after use of its best efforts, to locate alternative space comparable to the Premises. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this -14-
Section 17(a). if the casualty occurs in the last eighteen (18) months of the then current term of the Lease, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written notice. (B) CONDEMNATION. If the whole of the Premises are taken by any public authority under the power of eminent domain, or purchased by the condemnor in lieu thereof, the term of this Lease shall terminate as of the date possession is taken by such public authority. If only a part of the Premises are taken, the Lease shall terminate only as to the portion taken, and shall continue in full force and effect as to the remainder of the Premises, and the Base Monthly Rent shall be reduced proportionately; provided, however, if the remainder of the Premises cannot be made tenantable for the purposes for which Tenant has been using the Premises, or if more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the rentable square footage of the Premises are taken, then either party, by written notice to the other, given at least thirty (30) days prior to the date that possession must be surrendered to the public authority, may terminate this Lease effective as of such surrender of possession. If this Lease is not terminated and the Premises have been damaged as a consequence of a partial taking, Landlord shall restore the Premises continuing under this Lease at Landlord's cost and expense; provided, however, that Landlord shall not be required to repair or restore any injury or damage to the property of Tenant or to make any repairs or restoration of any alterations, additions, fixtures or improvements installed on the Premises, regardless of whether any of such items were initially installed or paid for by Landlord or Tenant. 18. ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLEASE. Tenant will not assign this Lease, or any interest hereunder, or sublet all or any portion of the Premises or permit the use of the Premises by any party other than Tenant and its agents, and this Lease, or any interest hereunder, shall not be assigned by operation of law without Landlord's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that this Lease may be assigned and all or any portion of the Premises sublet without Landlord's consent to a wholly owned subsidiary or parent of Tenant, or to the entity with which or into which Tenant may merge, whether or not Tenant is the survivor of such merger, or to the purchaser of substantially all of the assets of Tenant located at the Premises, provided Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of such assignment. A transfer of Tenant's stock shall not be deemed an assignment. In the event such written consent shall be given, no other or subsequent assignment or subletting shall be made without the previous written consent of Landlord, whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event the Premises or a portion thereof is sublet (other than in the event of a permitted transfer) rent paid to Tenant in excess of the rent payable hereunder shall be split equally between Landlord and Tenant after all costs are deducted which were incurred by Tenant attributable to subleasing such space. 19. TENANT DEFAULT. If Tenant fails to comply with any obligation set forth in this Lease within thirty (30) days (or five (5) business days for any monetary default) after receipt of notice of such failure, then, Landlord may with or without further notice or demand, at Landlord's option, and without being deemed guilty of trespass and/or without prejudicing any remedy or remedies which might otherwise be used by Landlord for arrearages or preceding breach of covenant or condition of this Lease, enter into and repossess said Premises and expel the Tenant and all those claiming under Tenant. In such event Landlord may eject and remove from the Premises all goods and effects (forcibly if necessary). This Lease if not otherwise terminated may immediately be declared by Landlord as terminated. The termination of this Lease pursuant to this Section 19 shall not relieve Tenant of its obligations to make the payments required herein. In the event this Lease is terminated pursuant to this Section 19, or if Landlord enters the Premises without terminating this Lease and Landlord relets all or a portion of the Premises, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all -15-
reasonable costs of reletting. Tenant shall remain liable for all unpaid rental which has been earned plus late payment charges and any deficiency between the net amounts received following reletting and the gross amounts due from Tenant, or if Landlord elects, Tenant shall be immediately liable for all rent that would be owing to the end of the term, less any rental loss Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided, which amount shall be discounted by the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank, situated nearest to the Premises. Waiver by the Landlord of any default, monetary or non-monetary, under this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of any future default under the Lease. Acceptance of Rent by Landlord after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any defaults (except the default pertaining to the particular payment accepted) and shall not act as a waiver of the right of Landlord to terminate this Lease as a result of such defaults by an unlawful detainer action or otherwise. Landlord shall promptly and continually pursue all commercially reasonable efforts and means to relet the Premises following a default by Tenant. 20. SUBORDINATION; ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. This Lease and all interest and estate of Tenant hereunder is subject to and is hereby subordinated to all present and future mortgages and deeds of trust affecting the Premises or the property of which said Premises are a part; provided, however, that a condition precedent to Tenant's agreement to subordinate this Lease pursuant to this section shall be Tenant's receipt of a non-disturbance agreement duly executed and acknowledged by the mortgagee or beneficiary of any deed of trust, and in recordable form, that in the event of foreclosure sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure, for so long as Tenant is not in default under the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct Lease between the Tenant and the lender or other succeeding owner of the Premises. Tenant agrees to execute at no expense to the Landlord, any instrument which may be deemed necessary or desirable by Landlord to further effect the subordination of this Lease to any such mortgage or deed of trust. In the event of a sale or assignment of Landlord's interest in the Premises, or in the event of any proceedings brought for the foreclosure of, or in the event of exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall attorn to the purchaser and recognize such purchaser as Landlord. Tenant agrees to execute, at no expense to Tenant, an estoppel certificate certifying as to the following matters: (i) that this Lease is in full force and effect, is binding upon Tenant and that the Lease has not been modified (or stating all modifications to this Lease); (ii) the date to which Rent has been paid, the dates to which Rent has been paid in advance, and the amount of any security deposit, if any, or prepaid rent; (iii) the rentable square footage of the Premises; (iv) that there are no current defaults which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a breach or default under the Lease by Tenant, or to Tenant's knowledge, by Landlord (or specifying any such defaults); (v) the Base Rent for the remainder of the Lease term, the Commencement Date, and the Expiration Date; and (vi) such other matters pertaining to the Lease as may be reasonably requested by Landlord or any mortgagee, beneficiary, purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Premises, the Building or any interest therein. 21. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS/ALLOWANCE. Landlord shall provide Tenant with a cash allowance equivalent to $35.00 per rentable square foot or $4,802,035.00 (the "Tenant -16-
Allowance"). The Tenant Allowance may be used by Tenant for all "hard" and "soft" costs associated with the Tenant's Work, including, without limitation, architect and engineer fees, the fee of a Tenant improvement coordinator, permit and plan costs and fees, paint, carpet, wiring and cabling, communication systems of every nature, construction and other costs Tenant incurs in order to build-out the Premises for Tenant's intended use. Any Tenant cost for Tenant's Work in excess of the Tenant Allowance shall be entirely the responsibility of Tenant; provided, however, that in addition to the Tenant Allowance, Landlord shall pay to Tenant $32,000.00 for Tenant's security system and $50,000.00 for Building lobby improvements, due upon completion of the security system and/or lobby improvements as the case may be. The Tenant's Work and the Tenant Allowance are more fully described in the Tenant Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit C. 22. FIBER OPTICS. Tenant shall have the right to install satellite dishes, fiber optics and related equipment for Tenant's sole use at Tenant's sole cost, expense and liability, subject to Landlord's approval of the location and method of installation, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed for installations that do not interfere with other electronic installations on the Building. Tenant's rights pursuant to this section shall include the right to make reasonable replacements, upgrades and additions subject to the terms of this section. 23. USE OF THE ROOF FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. Tenant shall have the right to enter on the roof of the Building from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the prior approval of Landlord, for the purpose of installing and maintaining, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, equipment in connection with Tenant's use of the Premises (the "Tenant's Equipment") at locations, designated by Landlord. Tenant shall submit drawings, specifications, and installation data for Tenant's Equipment to Landlord for its approval prior to installation. Installation of Tenant's Equipment shall be accomplished under the direct supervision of Landlord and in accordance with reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by Landlord. Tenant's Equipment shall be grounded in accordance with Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. requirements. Tenant shall make no penetration of the Building's roof during installation or removal of Tenant's Equipment without the prior written consent of Landlord. Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing all damages to Landlord's property caused by the installation, operation, repair, or removal of Tenant's Equipment, except to the extent caused by Landlord, its contractors, or employees. Furthermore, in the event Landlord determines that the Building roof must be repaired or resealed as a direct or indirect result of the installation, maintenance, repair, or removal of Tenant's Equipment, except to the extent caused by Landlord, its contractors, or employees, all such repairing and/or resealing shall be performed by Landlord's designated contractor at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Upon termination of this Lease, Tenant, at its sole cost, shall at the request of Landlord remove Tenant's Equipment from the roof of the Building, subject to the provisions of this section. Removal of Tenant's Equipment shall be done in a manner satisfactory to Landlord. If access to the Building roof is required by Tenant at times other than normal business hours, Landlord reserves the right to charge Tenant any actual costs incurred by Landlord for overtime wages to Landlord's employees or contractors. -17-
Tenant shall obtain and maintain all necessary FCC licenses, if any, and all other governmental approvals, licenses, and permits required to operate Tenant's Equipment, which operation shall not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any other tenants within the Building. Tenant agrees that Landlord hereafter shall have the right to install and to grant others the right to install transmitting equipment, satellite dishes, antennae, and similar equipment on the roof of the Building, so long as neither the installation nor operation of such equipment interferes with the operation of Tenant's Equipment. Tenant agrees that transmissions from Tenant's Equipment shall not cause interference with transmissions of other persons currently operating communications equipment in the business community in which the Building is located. Upon written notification from Landlord of such interference, Tenant shall immediately stop operation of Tenant's Equipment and not resume operation until such interference is cured. Any future agreement granting another tenant of the Building or any other person the right to make rooftop installations shall contain a covenant by such other tenant or person that its installation and operation of rooftop equipment will not interfere with the operation of Tenant's Equipment, and that if such interference occurs, such other tenant or other user shall cease installation or operation of its equipment until such interference is cured. 24. PURCHASE OPTION. Prior to Landlord listing or actively marketing the Building for sale, Tenant shall have the right of first offer to purchase the Building and the real property on which the Building is located. Prior to listing the Building for sale or otherwise offering the Building for sale to any party, unless in the event of exchange or trade, Landlord shall provide Tenant with notice of the availability of the Building for purchase. This notice will identify the Landlord's intended purchase price for the property (assuming no sales commissions) and any other material terms of a proposed sale. Tenant shall have ten (10) business days following receipt of such notice to notify Landlord of its intent to accept the same, in which event the parties shall promptly enter into a mutually acceptable real property purchase and sale agreement containing the agreed material terms and other terms generally consistent with comparable commercial real property sales agreements in the Seattle metropolitan area. 25. TELEPHONE SERVICE. If Tenant desires telephonic or any other electric connection, Landlord, with Tenant's help, will direct the electricians as to where and how the wires are to be introduced, and without such directions no boring or cutting external to the Premises for wires in installation thereof will be permitted. Tenant shall supply its own requirements for telephone service with respect to the Premises and shall be allowed to select its providers for telecommunications and other services. Tenant or its service providers, without charge, shall be allowed to install T-1 lines, multiple points of entry, and other special telecommunication facilities, including cabling and connections from service providers to the Premises. Landlord shall, without charge, cooperate as needed with Tenant's telecommunications and other service providers, including, without limitation providing Building information, providing closet space in the basement of the Building, and signing required authorizations for installation. 26. RISK. All personal property of any kind or description whatsoever in the demised Premises shall be at Tenant's sole risk. Landlord shall not be liable for any damage done to or loss of such personal property or damage or loss suffered by the business or occupation of the Tenant arising from any acts or neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the Building, or of Landlord or the employees of Landlord, or of any other persons, or from bursting, overflowing or leaking of water, sewer or steam pipes, or from the heating or plumbing or sprinklering fixtures, or from electric wires, or from gas, or odors, or caused in any other manner whatsoever except in the case of -18-
negligence or intentional acts on the part of Landlord or its agents. Tenant shall keep in force throughout the term of this lease such casualty, general liability and business interruption insurance as a prudent tenant occupying and using the Premises would keep in force. 27. INSOLVENCY. If Tenant becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for the business or property of Tenant, or a petition is filed in a court of competent jurisdiction to have Tenant adjudged bankrupt and either remains undismissed or a period of sixty (60) days or results in the entry of an order of relief against Tenant which is not fully stayed within sixty (60) days after entry, then Landlord may at Landlord's option terminate this Lease. Said termination shall reserve unto Landlord all of the rights and remedies available under Section 19 hereof, and Landlord may accept rents from such assignee or receiver without waiving or forfeiting said right of termination. 28. BINDING EFFECT. The parties hereto further agree with each other that each of the provisions of this Lease shall extend to and shall, as the case may require, bind and inure to the benefit, not only of Landlord and Tenant, but also of their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 18 of this Lease. It is also understood and agreed that the terms "Landlord" and "Tenant" and verbs and pronouns in the singular number are uniformly used throughout this Lease regardless of gender, number or fact of incorporation of the parties hereto. The typewritten riders or supplemental provisions, if any, attached or added hereto are made a part of this Lease by reference. It is further mutually agreed that no waiver by Landlord of a breach by Tenant of any covenant or condition of this Lease shall be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other covenant or condition. 29. HOLDING OVER. If Tenant holds possession of the Premises after the term of this Lease, Tenant shall be deemed to be a month-to-month tenant upon the same terms and conditions as contained herein, except rent which shall be revised to reflect 125% of the then current amount due under the Lease. During any month-to-month tenancy, Tenant acknowledges Landlord will be attempting to relet the Premises. Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord and Tenant further acknowledges Landlord's right to terminate the Lease with proper notice. 30. TIME FOR PERFORMANCE. If any date for performance hereunder falls on a day that is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, then such performance shall be due on the next business day thereafter. 31. ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any legal action is commenced to enforce any provision of this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements including those on appeal. 32. NO REPRESENTATIONS. Neither party has made any representations or promises except as contained herein. 33. QUIET ENJOYMENT. So long as Tenant pays the rent and performs the covenants contained in this Lease, Tenant shall hold and enjoy the Premises peaceably and quietly, subject to the provisions of this Lease. -19-
34. RECORDATION. Tenant shall not record this Lease without the prior written consent of Landlord, whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. However, at the request of Landlord, both parties shall execute a memorandum or "short form" of this Lease for the purpose of recordation in a form customarily used for such purpose. Said memorandum or short form of this Lease shall describe the parties, the Premises and the Lease term, and shall incorporate this Lease by reference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant may record or file this Lease with the SEC as required by SEC rules and other regulations. 35. MUTUAL PREPARATION OF LEASE. It is acknowledged and agreed that this Lease was prepared mutually by both parties. In the event of ambiguity, it is agreed by both parties that it shall not be construed against either party as the drafter of this Lease. 36. GOVERNING LAW. This Lease shall be exclusively governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. 37. REAL ESTATE COMMISSION. Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that Washington Partners, Inc. ("Broker") represented Tenant in this transaction and is due a Leasing Fee equivalent to $7.50 per RSF leased. This Leasing Fee is an agreed obligation payable by Landlord to Broker. However, the parties agree that Tenant shall pay the Leasing Fee to Broker in full upon full execution and delivery of this Lease and, in turn, shall be entitled to credits therefor as pre-paid rent for months 12, 24, 48 and 72 of the Initial Term hereof as otherwise provided in Sections 1(n) and 5(b) above herein. To the extent, if any, that the Pre-Paid Rent attributable to months 12, 24, 48 and 72 exceeds the Leasing Fee, Tenant shall pay any such excess to Landlord as soon as the same is ascertainable. Each party shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from any claim for a commission by any other broker allegedly acting on such party's behalf. 38. NOTICES.

addition or alteration in any of the work shown in the Tenant's Plans after Landlord's approval thereof (whether the result of governmental requirement or otherwise), Tenant shall promptly give Landlord a written description of the changes requested and submit to Landlord plans and specifications describing such change. Provided the plans and specifications are complete, Landlord shall expeditiously (but in no event longer than within five (5) business days after receipt of the complete plans and specifications) review such plans and specifications and provide to Tenant written approval of proposed changes. Landlord's approval shall be governed by Section III.A.4. above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the costs of any Change Order relating to the Tenant Work shall be applied against the Tenant Work Allowance to the extent of any remaining balance thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord shall have no obligation to agree to or complete any Change Order if and to the extent any delay resulting or possibly resulting from the same jeopardizes the Delivery Date of the Premises, unless Tenant accepts total responsibility for such delay and reasonably compensates Landlord for such delay. 2. CHANGES DURING CONSTRUCTION (Shell and Core Tenant Upgrades and Tenant Work). Revisions to the Shell and Core Plans or Tenant Plans, if any, are to be accommodated by Field Change Orders. A "Field Change Order" is a document which outlines the scope of a requested change in the Work as defined by the Shell and Core Plans and Tenant Plans and bears the signature of Tenant and Landlord representatives approving such change in scope. All such plans, specifications, and Field Change Orders shall be approved by Landlord and Tenant prior to being executed or acted upon by the Landlord's or Tenant's Contractors. Landlord and Tenant shall be given 24 hours to respond without causing a Landlord or Tenant Delay unless otherwise specified in said Field Change Order. In the event the Field Change Order increases the cost of the Shell and Core or Tenant Work beyond the maximum Tenant Work Allowance, Tenant shall pay for the work per the terms of this Exhibit and the Lease.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 8, 2006, F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing certain financial results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2006, the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") formed a special committee of the Board (the "Special Committee") to conduct a review of the Company's stock option practices. On November 8, 2006, the Company announced that the Special Committee had completed its review.
The Special Committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 through 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes and that the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect.
The Company has conducted an analysis to determine what adjustments need to be made to the Company's historical financial statements. Based on its analysis, the Company will be required to record an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22.9 million, in the aggregate, for fiscal years 1999 through 2006. This accounting adjustment is net of applicable tax accounting adjustments. These adjustments will not affect the Company's current cash position or previously reported revenues.
On October 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") determined, after consultation with management, that the Company should restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2005 and its financial statements for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006, to reflect the non-cash, stock-based compensation expense described above. The Company intends to file its restated financial statements, as well as its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which has been delayed due to the Special Committee's inquiry, as soon as practicable.
Additionally, the Company is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of this situation on its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is currently reviewing the Special Committee's findings.
The Audit Committee has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 8.01 with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
On November 8, 2006, the Company issued a related press release announcing the matters described herein. The full text of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

EXHIBIT 99.1
SEATTLE, WANovember 8, 2006F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced that the special committee of the company's board of directors has completed its inquiry into the company's stock option practices and reported its findings, which have been reviewed and adopted by the board. As a result, the company has released its income statements for the third and fourth quarters and for the full fiscal year 2006.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, revenue of $111.7 million was up 12 percent from $100.1 million in the prior quarter and 39 percent from $80.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Fourth quarter net income was $17.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share) compared to net income of $17.0 million ($0.41 per diluted share) in the prior quarter. For fiscal 2006, the company reported record annual revenue of $394.0 million, up 40 percent from $281.4 million in fiscal 2005. Net income for the fiscal year was $66.0 million ($1.59 per diluted share).
Excluding stock compensation expense but including expenses related to the options inquiry, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $24.0 million ($0.58 per diluted share) compared to non-GAAP net income of $21.0 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2006 was $84.3 million ($2.03 per diluted share).
A reconciliation of reported net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said that the company's strong revenue growth during the second half of fiscal 2006 helped drive its improving profitability, despite increasing investment in sales and product development and additional expenses of approximately $7.0 million related to the options inquiry.
McAdam also noted that during the second half of fiscal 2006 the company continued to strengthen its cash position, generating $37.3 million and $18.0 million in cash from operations for the third and fourth quarters respectively. For fiscal 2006, cash flow from operations was $125.4 million compared to $85.0 million in fiscal 2005. At year end, the company's cash and investments totaled $492 million.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, ending December 31, McAdam reiterated the company's revenue target of $116 million to $118 million and said management is targeting earnings per share between $0.43 and $0.45.
Conclusion of Special Committee Investigation  Financial and Remedial Measures
F5 today announced that the special committee has completed its review of the company's stock option practices and has reported its findings to the company's board of directors. The special committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 through 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes and that the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect. These findings have been reviewed and unanimously adopted by the board of directors and are currently being reviewed by our independent registered public accounting firm.
F5 has conducted an analysis, in conjunction with the board's audit committee and professional advisors, to determine the accounting impact of the special committee's findings. Based on its analysis, F5 will be required to record an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22.9 million, in the aggregate, for fiscal years 1999 through 2006. This accounting adjustment is net of applicable tax accounting adjustments. Through September 30, 2006, F5 has spent approximately $7.0 million in legal and accounting fees related to this inquiry.
F5 plans to file its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which has been delayed due to the pending final outcome of the special committee's inquiry, and all restated financial statements that are impacted by the above-described adjustments, as soon as practicable. The company currently anticipates that the above-described restatements will be completed in time to file its Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 by the required deadline.
In connection with the conclusion of its review, the special committee has also recommended that the board of directors, and its compensation and audit committees, consider and adopt certain remedial measures related to the issues raised in the special committee's investigation, including:
 
Page 3 of 8
These recommended remedial measures were reviewed and unanimously adopted by the board of directors.
In addition, at the recommendation of the special committee, F5 has identified and hired an interim general counsel to replace its current general counsel, who has tendered her resignation. The current general counsel will continue with F5 until November 22, 2006 solely to assist in transition matters.
F5 is continuing to cooperate fully with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in their respective inquiries regarding the company's historical stock option practices.

GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability.
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its financial results.
Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue range, demand for application delivery networking and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; and the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle.
Moreover, this press release contains forward-looking statements concerning the special committee's review of the company's stock option practices and related accounting, certain recommended remedial measures adopted by the board, as well as the company's expected restatement of its historical financial statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will determine that the proper accounting for the company's prior stock option grants differs from the accounting treatment utilized in determining the adjustments described in this release; that the amount and timing of additional stock-based compensation expenses and other additional expenses to be recorded in connection with affected option grants, and the corresponding restatement of our financial statements, may change; that our ability to file required reports with the SEC on a timely basis may be further impaired or that we may not file such reports within the timeframe outlined in this press release; that our ability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market for continued listing of our shares may be further impaired; that potential claims and proceedings may arise relating to such matters, including additional shareholder litigation and action by the SEC or other governmental agencies; that other actions may be taken or required as a result of the special committee's findings; including actions which may be recommended by our independent registered public accounting firm, and that the anticipated accounting adjustments and other factors described above could have negative tax or other implications for the company.
F5 has no duty to update any matters discussed in this press release. More information about potential risk factors that could affect F5's business and financial results is included in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company"), in consultation with the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), approved the Company's fiscal 2007 base salary and performance-based target percentage for a quarterly cash bonus (the "target bonus percentage") for the Company's president and chief executive officer. At such meeting, the Board also approved an annual equity grant in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs") for such executive as part of the Company's policy on equity compensation for executives. On the same day, the Compensation Committee also approved equity grants in the form of RSUs, for certain of the other current executive officers disclosed in the Company's last proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2006. These executive officers, together with the Company's president and chief executive officer, are collectively referred to as the "Named Executive Officers."
     The following table sets forth the fiscal 2007 base salaries, target bonus percentages and RSU grants for each Named Executive Officer. The base salaries and target bonus percentages are effective as of October 1, 2006, the first day of the Company's fiscal year 2007. The RSU grants are effective as of December 15, 2006.
     Under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Officers, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2004, each executive of the Company is eligible to receive quarterly cash bonuses if the Company achieves Board-approved performance targets. At the end of each fiscal quarter, subject to the Company's performance during such period, executives are eligible to receive an aggregate maximum cash bonus in an amount equal to 25% of their annual base salary multiplied by their respective target bonus percentages. In the event that the Company does not achieve at least 80% of the performance targets for a quarterly period, no bonus shall be paid to an executive under the plan. If the Company achieves between 80% and 100% of the performance targets for a quarter, the aggregate cash bonus payable to an executive for such period is proportionately reduced. If the Company exceeds the performance targets for a quarterly period, the participating executives may earn additional cash bonuses at the discretion of the Board.
     The equity grants described above were made pursuant to the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of RSUs in each such grant vests in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2008. The vesting of twenty-five percent (25%) of each such grant is subject to the Company achieving specified
Table of Contents
percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2007, relative to fiscal year 2006. The vesting of the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) is subject to the Company meeting specified performance criteria to be set by the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2008. In accordance with the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, a Named Executive Officer must be employed by the Company or its affiliates on each vesting date in order to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such vesting date.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, F5 Networks announced revenue of $120.0 million, up 7 percent from $111.7 million in the prior quarter and 36 percent from $88.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Net income was $22.4 million ($0.53 per diluted share), compared to $17.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $15.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 24, 2007
According to F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam, the company's revenue growth during the quarter was driven primarily by strong enterprise sales in North America. "Including Central and South America, revenue for the Americas grew 13 percent sequentially and 39 percent year over year. Growth in Europe was solid while Asia-Pacific revenue was down slightly from the prior quarter. Japan revenue was also down sequentially, but was consistent with the seasonal pattern we've seen there during the past three years.
"In addition to solid growth in our core business, which accounted for 90% of total revenue, security and WAN optimization revenue grew sequentially. As FirePass and WANJet become available on TMOS at the end of fiscal 2007, we believe the integration of these products will add further impetus to sales of our core products," McAdam said.
"With respect to our core products, I'm happy to report that we have completed beta testing of the BIG-IP 8800, equipped with TMOS-based BIG-IP version 9.4 software, and that it will be generally available this quarter. The 8800 platform allows customers to apply more value to applications as they flow across the network by delivering the fastest decision-per-second performance in the industry at the application layer  where it matters most."
In comparison to the BIG-IP 8400, currently the performance leader in application delivery networking, the BIG-IP 8800 delivers a 50% increase in Layer 7 throughput and doubles SSL and compression throughput. Based on published reports, the BIG-IP 8800 is more than twice as fast as the nearest competing product in all three areas.
 
"Combined with the advanced capabilities of BIG-IP 9.4, the BIG-IP 8800 reduces total cost of ownership while delivering performance and broad functionality to meet the most demanding needs of enterprise customers and internet service providers. Feedback from extended beta-tests with more than two dozen customers has been very positive, and we are confident the BIG-IP 8800 will enable us to penetrate new accounts and quickly become the new high-end standard for many of our existing customers," McAdam said.
Along with its solid gains in revenue and income, F5 continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the first quarter. Reflecting the strong growth of its services business, deferred revenue increased 14% to $68.7 million at quarter end. Cash flow from operations was $46.8 million, and the company ended the quarter with $545 million in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending March 31, 2007, McAdam said management has set a target range of $124 million to $126 million in revenue with an earnings target of $0.44 to $0.46 per diluted share.

SEATTLE, WAApril 24, 2007
The company's solid revenue gains reflect the continuing strength of its core application delivery networking business, which grew 8 percent during the quarter and accounted for 92 percent of total revenue. John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said the strength of the company's core business relative to its WAN optimization and security offerings was no surprise and further validated the company's plans to port WANJet and FirePass to TMOS and integrate their functionality into its application delivery networking solutions. TMOS-based versions of both products are scheduled for delivery in late summer.
"In the meantime, the rich functionality of BIG-IP's TMOS-based solution set, coupled with the flexibility of iRules and the high-performance of our integrated hardware platforms, is continuing to open new market opportunities," McAdam said. "Along with growing demand in large enterprises, changes in the technology landscape are driving telecommunications companies and internet service providers to look for new and better ways to manage the complex array of data, information and services they are attempting to provide their customers. From the perspective of both functionality and performance, our family of BIG-IP products offers these organizations the widest array of fully-integrated solutions to meet their needs, and we are continuing to invest in all areas of our business to take advantage of these opportunities."

management policies in the network. This deal ensures Acopia's future viability from a company perspective and will ultimately enhance the breadth of their data management capabilities."
     Acopia serves a large, high-growth market, which is directly adjacent to F5's existing core market. With this move, F5 will increase its total addressable market to include storage solutions and technologies  comprising one of the largest IT budget items for organizations worldwide.
     "In conversations with organizations around the world, IDC found that IT executives are increasing their deployments of file-based storage by 50% to more that 200% a year as they consolidate existing data centers and roll out new fixed content applications," said Richard Villars, Vice President of Storage Systems Research at IDC. "These companies need solutions like intelligent file virtualization to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs associated with creating, organizing, protecting, retaining exploding volumes of business critical, file-based information."
     "We are very excited to join the outstanding team at F5," said Christopher Lynch, President and CEO at Acopia Networks. "F5's global channels and powerful brand will accelerate Acopia's ability to address the growing worldwide demand for our products. Our technologies and strategies are very complementary and will enable the combined companies to offer customers an optimized end to end solution from the client to the storage layer."

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On September 12, 2007, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks") completed its previously announced acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc. ("Acopia"), a privately held Delaware corporation that provides high-performance, intelligent file virtualization solutions. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 6, 2007, by and among F5 Networks, Checkmate Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5 Networks, Acopia, and the stockholders' representative referred to therein (the "Merger Agreement"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Checkmate Acquisition Corporation merged with and into Acopia with Acopia surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5 Networks. Upon consummation of the acquisition, F5 Networks assumed Acopia's stock option plan and all Acopia unvested in-the-money stock options that were outstanding immediately prior to closing. Holders of the assumed Acopia unvested in-the-money stock options will have the right to purchase F5 Networks common stock upon exercise of such stock options. The aggregate purchase price payable to the former Acopia stockholders and holders of vested in-the-money Acopia stock options was $210,000,000 in cash, less $2,476,857 transaction fees incurred by Acopia. $21,000,000 of the aggregate merger consideration will be held in escrow to secure claims by F5 Networks for indemnification under the Merger Agreement. Prior to the closing of the Merger, there were no material relationships between or among F5 Networks or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the one hand, and Acopia or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the other.
     The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 8, 2007.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 (Nasdaq: FFIV), the global leader in Application Delivery Networking, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc., a best-of-breed provider of high-performance, intelligent file virtualization solutions. On August 6, 2007, F5 announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire Acopia.
SEATTLE, SEPTEMBER 13, 2007
F5 Networks, Inc.
Acopia solutions increase F5's strategic value to customers by optimizing the network storage layer that is entrusted with an organization's data. In extending the power of intelligent networking to all levels of application delivery, the acquisition furthers F5's strategic goal of making applications and information readily available to global users.
"Customers are recognizing the value of applying intelligent network technology to the challenges of managing growth at all levels of the application delivery infrastructure," said Steve Duplessie, Founder and Senior Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). "As the demands of doing business across the extended enterprise increase, the ability of application delivery controllers to intelligently optimize availability, performance, and user access to information has made them the primary weapon in an IT organization's arsenal. Intelligent file virtualization leverages the same concepts to address the equally challenging issues facing IT in managing the resulting growth of their file storage infrastructures." An in-depth analysis from ESG regarding the acquisition can be found at .
http://www.f5.com/reports/esg20070801.pdf
 
"Acopia has proven technology that is widely deployed in global enterprises today. Intelligent file virtualization is a natural and important extension to F5's data center vision," said John McAdam, President and CEO of F5. "Within the datacenter, F5 optimizes the web and application layers. Externally, we optimize the links between data centers. With the addition of Acopia, we extend that value by optimizing the file storage layerproviding our customers faster, more secure, and more reliable access to applications and information regardless of their location."
Acopia's President and CEO, Christopher Lynch, and his leadership team are joining F5's management team. "I'm excited to bring the two companies together and demonstrate to customers how Acopia extends F5's Application Delivery Network value proposition," said Lynch. "Acopia customers recognize that our products enable their networks to provide better control, manageability, availability, and access to information, which is the reason Acopia's technology is the leading intelligent file virtualization solution deployed in large enterprises today."
Based on the purchase price allocation, F5 expects to take a one-time charge of $14 million ($0.16 per diluted share) in the current quarter for in-process research and development related to this acquisition. Management will provide more information on Acopia and the impact of acquisition-related expenses on subsequent quarters during the company's quarterly conference call on October 24th.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAOctober 24, 2007F5 Networks, Inc . (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $145.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, up 10 percent from $132.4 million in the prior quarter and 30 percent from $111.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Fourth quarter net income of $12.9 million ($0.15 per diluted share) included a one-time charge of $14 million ($0.16 per diluted share) stemming from the company's recent acquisition of Acopia Networks. Net income was $21.8 million ($.26 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2007 and $17.8 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. For fiscal 2007, revenue was $525.7 million, up 33 percent from $394.0 million in fiscal 2006. Net income for the year was $77.0 million ($.90 per diluted share) compared to net income of $66.0 million ($0.80 per diluted share) in fiscal 2006.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's fourth consecutive year of strong revenue growth reflects the continuing strength of F5's core business in the context of stepped-up organizational investments in fiscal 2007. "Excluding Acopia, our single biggest investment during the year, we added approximately 385 employees across the organization, the majority in sales and marketing, product development and service. We continue to believe that our investments in sales and marketing will have a significant impact on our revenue growth in the coming year and enable us to further expand our share of the growing application delivery networking market. Meanwhile, we are seeing returns on our investment in R&D in the delivery of market-expanding products like WANJet on TMOS, announced today, and in our progress toward the delivery of our next generation chassis platform code named Montreal by calendar year end. Equally important, our investments in our service business have enabled us to provide a growing array of services and to respond more quickly to customers' needs. As a result, we believe F5 is well-positioned to extend its leadership in application delivery networking and to become a leader in the emerging file virtualization market through our newly acquired data solutions business."
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, McAdam said the company's revenue target is $154 million to $156 million. Earnings for the first quarter are expected to be $0.20 to $0.21 per diluted share.

Boston, Massachusetts November 16, 2007

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Acopia Networks, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Acopia Networks, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Acopia Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), , which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the fair-value of share-based compensation awards.
Share-Based Payment
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and will need to obtain additional funding or alternative means of financial support or both prior to December 31, 2007 in order to sustain operations. These factors raise substantial doubt concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1. Organization
Acopia Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) was incorporated on December 26, 2001, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company is a developer of network switch equipment and software, which is used by large enterprises to enhance performance and gain efficiencies for existing server and storage systems.
Since operations commenced, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, hiring personnel, product development, acquiring operational assets, and raising capital. The Company remained in the development stage until the later half of 2004 when the Company began commercial shipment of its products and recognized revenue.
The Company is subject to a number of risks common to companies at its stage and in its industry, including, but not limited to, the uncertainty of obtaining additional financing, competition from larger companies, the uncertainty of successful development and market acceptance of products, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, and the uncertainty of future profitability. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred losses of approximately $20.8 million; and as of December 31, 2006, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $73.3 million. The Company has funded these losses primarily through equity financings. Based upon the Company's current plans, the Company will be required to obtain additional funding, or alternative means of financial support or both prior to December 31, 2007 in order to sustain operations. These factors raise substantial doubt concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently pursuing various sources of financial support, including obtaining funds through an additional equity financing and believes that it will be able to obtain the additional financing. However, there can be no assurances that such funding or financial support will be available or adequate to allow the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
On August 6, 2007, F5 Networks, Inc., a global application delivery networking company, signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of Acopia Networks, Inc., for approximately $210 million cash. The transaction is expected to close on or shortly after September 14, 2007, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. These consolidated financial statements reflect the use of the following significant accounting policies, as described below and elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid securities purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and consist of money market funds which management believes to have a high credit standing subject to minimal credit and market risk.
Marketable Securities
The Company determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities at December 31, 2006, with original maturities greater than three months, consist of auction market preferred and floating rate perpetual instruments which management believes to have a high credit standing subject to minimal credit and market risk and are designated as available-for-sale short-term investments. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income, net.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and include material, labor, and overhead and consist of the following:
Significant Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company had three customers that accounted for 10%, 10% and 11%, respectively, of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with two financial institutions. At December 31, 2006, the Company had four customers that accounted for 31%, 16%, 14% and 10%, respectively, of accounts receivable.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight- line method and charges amounts to operations to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives. The Company classifies equipment used by customers under evaluation arrangements as customer evaluation equipment. The Company depreciates customer evaluation equipment over two years beginning 90 days after the equipment is placed in service at customer locations.
 
Property and equipment consist of the following:
Long-Lived Assets
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, . SFAS No. 144 requires that the Company continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles may warrant revision, or that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired. The Company does not believe that its long-lived assets have been impaired as of December 31, 2006.
Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Revenue Recognition
The Company's products incorporate software that is more than incidental to the related hardware, and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the American Institution of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, (SOP 97-2), as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9 and as interpreted. The Company includes shipping and handling costs charged to customers in revenue in accordance with EITF 00-10, .
Software Revenue Recognition,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to end users and nonstocking resellers when there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is probable. If uncertainties exist, the Company recognizes revenue when those uncertainties are resolved.
The Company's products are not generally sold on a standalone basis. Customers typically also procure installation services and maintenance. In 2006, Company personnel were involved in almost every installation of its equipment. Until the Company provides multiple third party installation alternatives to its customers; it will not consider delivery of equipment complete until the installation is completed.
The Company's arrangement with end user customers and resellers does not include any right of return or price protection. In multiple element arrangements that contain product and service elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the entire arrangement (product, installation, training, services and maintenance) ratably over the service period. An exception to recognizing revenue for the entire arrangement ratably over the maintenance term occurs when certain of the elements of a multiple element transaction are delivered and or accepted after the maintenance term has commenced. In that instance, all of the revenue including maintenance will be deferred until delivery and acceptance is complete, at which time there will be a catch up for the ratable amount that would have been recognized if delivery was complete and acceptance occurred on the first day of the maintenance term. This approach is referred to as the cumulative catch-up approach for recognizing revenue. Amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue expected to be recognized as revenue more than one year subsequent to the balance sheet date is classified as long term deferred
 
revenue. Additionally, the Company defers recognition and capitalizes costs associated with the deferred revenue as other current assets and long-term assets on the balance sheet if the revenue will be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date otherwise they are recognized as other long term assets. The Company recognizes these amounts as cost of revenue over the same period that revenue is recognized.
Research, Development, and Software Development Costs
The Company accounts for its software development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, . Accordingly, the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time, any additional costs are capitalized. The Company believes technological feasibility has been established at the time at which a working model of the software has been completed. Because the Company believes its current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have been capitalized to date.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
SFAS No. 130, , requires companies to report comprehensive income (loss) as a measure of overall performance. Comprehensive income (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. For all periods presented, the Company's comprehensive loss is the same as its reported loss.
Reporting Comprehensive Income
Limited Source Suppliers and Contract Manufacturers
Several key components of the Company's products are currently available from limited sources. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components, the manufacturing of its products would be delayed and the Company would be unable to ship its products on a timely basis. This could result in lost or delayed revenues, damage to the Company's reputation, and increased manufacturing costs.
The Company currently subcontracts the manufacturing and assembly of its products and procurement of materials to independent manufacturers. The Company does not have significant internal manufacturing capabilities. The Company's reliance on contract manufacturers exposes it to a number of risks, including reduced control over manufacturing capacity and component availability, product completion and delivery times, product quality, manufacturing costs, and inadequate or excess inventory levels, which could lead to product shortage or charges for excess and obsolete inventory.
Stock-Based Compensation
In December, 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), , which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, and amends SFAS No. 95, . Generally, the approach under SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Effective January
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Statement of Cash Flows
 
1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), , (SFAS No. 123R) to account for all stock options granted to employees and non-employees. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company had accounted for options to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation associated with stock awards to employees is determined as the difference, if any, between the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date stock compensation is measured and the price an employee must pay to exercise the award. As the Company previously accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value and used the minimum value method for disclosures of the fair value of awards under SFAS No. 123, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the prospective method. Under the prospective method, the Company applies the requirements of SFAS No. 123R prospectively to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the January 1, 2006 implementation date. Accordingly, results for fiscal years prior to January 1, 2006 do not include, and have not been restated to reflect, amounts associated with the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. The Company continues to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards, which was the intrinsic method, unless such awards are modified. Stock-based compensation to certain non-employees is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R, utilizing the measurement guidance of EITF 96-18 .
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services
The Company has recorded total stock-based compensation expense of $368,176 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the Statement of Operations as follows:
As of December 31, 2006, there was $2,843,364 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements to be recognized in future periods. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years.
The Company's calculations of the fair value of employee grants under its stock-based compensation arrangements were made using the Black-Scholes pricing model in 2006 using the following assumptions:
As there has been no public market for the Company's Common Stock, the expected volatility for the Company's common stock was determined based on the historical volatility of comparable publicly traded
 
companies in similar industries. The average expected life was determined according to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) shortcut approach as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107, . The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company has not paid, and does not anticipate paying, cash dividends on shares of its Common Stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. An estimated forfeiture rate of 12.5% was applied in determining the expenses recognized in 2006, based upon historical stock options granted and forfeited. The Company engaged an independent appraisal firm to determine the fair value per share of its Common Stock, which was estimated to be $0.60 as of December 31, 2006.
Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments Staff Accounting Bulletin
Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company's financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital lease obligations, and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments approximate their fair value.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Fair Value Measurement
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible items at fair market value as of specified election dates. Among the items eligible for such measurement are investments in subsidiaries and variable interest entities that an entity is required to consolidate, obligations under employee benefit plans, lease obligations, and various financial instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, , which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
3. Marketable Securities
The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities:
 
The Company's debt securities consist of auction market preferred and floating rate perpetual instruments that reset interest rates on a periodic basis, which allows the holder to sell at the reset date, although the underlying security does not mature on those reset dates. The Company considers these securities to be short-term due to their liquidity and the Company's intention to liquidate these securities as part of its overall cash management plans.
The Company has not realized any material gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities in the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, the Company did not have any unrealized holding gains or losses at December 31, 2006. The fair value approximated the securities' cost basis.

5. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
During 2002, the Company issued a total of 10,960,000 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) which resulted in net cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $10.9 million. During 2003, the Company issued a total of 25,751,087 shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $30.0 million.

Conversion
Each share of the Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, into common shares, subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or certain other changes in the capitalization, as defined. Mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock will occur (i) immediately upon the closing of an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of at least $2.978 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or similar recapitalization affecting such shares) and resulting in at least $40,000,000 of net proceeds or (ii) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. Also, pursuant to special mandatory conversion provisions, if holders of the Preferred Stock do not participate in certain future financings, shares of the Preferred Stock held by such nonparticipating holders shall automatically convert to Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate.
Voting Rights
Each holder of outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of the Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date of the vote.
Dividends
The Company shall not declare, pay, or set aside any dividends on shares of Common Stock (other than dividends payable in shares of Common Stock on the outstanding shares of Common Stock) unless the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of the Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (A) $0.08 per share, per annum for Series A Preferred Stock, $0.0932 per share, per annum for Series B Preferred Stock, $0.1036 per share, per annum for Series C Preferred Stock and $0.11912 per share, per annum for Series D Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) and (B) the product of (1) the per share dividend to be declared, paid, or set aside for the Common Stock, multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of the Preferred Stock is then convertible.
The Company shall not declare, pay, or set aside any dividends on shares of any series of the Preferred Stock of the Company unless the holders of the other three series of the Preferred Stock shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of such other series of the Preferred Stock in an amount proportionate (based on the relative amounts of the dividends payable described above to the dividend per share on the first such series of the Preferred Stock determined as if all such shares of the Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no dividend or other distribution shall accrue or be paid with respect to any share of capital stock of the Company for any period, unless and until declared by the Board
 
of Directors of the Company and approved by the holders of the Preferred Stock and no dividends shall automatically accrue on shares of the Preferred Stock.
As of December 31, 2006, no such dividends have been declared.
Liquidation
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, winding up of the Company or the acquisition of a majority control of the Company or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (sale of the Company), the holders of the Preferred Stock, then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made for the Common Stock or any other class or series of stock junior to the Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock, $1.165 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock, $1.295 per share for the Series C Preferred Stock and $1.489 per share for the Series D Preferred Stock (subject in each case to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares), plus any declared but unpaid dividends, or (ii) the amount per share payable if each share of Preferred Stock had converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or sale of the Company. If upon the liquidation, dissolution, winding up or sale of the Company, the assets of the Company available for distribution to the stockholders is insufficient to pay the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock, the full preferential amounts to which they shall be entitled, then the holders of the Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of such assets of the Company in proportion to the respective preferred amounts payable.
After the payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock on a pro rata basis.
Redemption
The Company shall be obligated to offer to redeem, at a per share price equal to $1.00 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock, $1.165 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock, $1.295 per share in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock and $1.489 per share for the Series D Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends (subject in each case to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares), all of the Preferred Stock, in three equal annual installments with respect to each such series of Preferred Stock, each to commence within 60 days of each of the fifth, sixth, and seventh annual anniversary dates, respectively, of the Series D Preferred Stock original issue date, to the extent it is lawfully able to do so and if requested by the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. The shares to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata among the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock electing to accept redemption.
If the Company does not have sufficient funds available to redeem the Preferred Stock redeemable on any redemption date, the Company will redeem the maximum possible number of shares of Preferred Stock, on a pro rata basis, and redeem all remaining redeemable shares as soon as practicable after the Company has funds available.
6. Common Stock
Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board, subject to the preferential dividend rights of the Preferred Stock (Note 5).
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company had 70,111,810 shares of its Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and 16,080,238 shares of its Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan of which there are 3,447,386 shares remaining for future grants (Note 7).
7. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan
The Company adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan), which provides for the issuance shares of Common Stock pursuant to incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, and restricted stock. All options are awarded at the discretion of the Board, and vest over periods as determined by the Board, generally at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary date of grant and in equal monthly installments over the next three years. Pursuant to the Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant, unless an employee owns or is deemed to own more than 10% of the combined voting power of all the classes of outstanding stock, in which case, the exercise price is 110% of fair market value. The option term may not exceed ten years, unless an employee owns or is deemed to own more than 10% of the combined voting power of all the classes of outstanding stock, in which case the option term is five years. Options to employees are granted with a ten year contractual life.
Restricted Stock Agreements
The Company has entered into restricted stock agreements with certain officers, employees, and consultants of the Company. The stock restrictions related to the sale and transferability of the stock lapse ratably according to a vesting schedule and are contingent upon maintaining a business relationship or continued employment by the Company. During the period from inception (December 26, 2001) through December 31, 2002, a total of 8,886,000 shares of stock were sold to the founders, employees, and consultants. Of the 8,886,000 shares, 4,221,000 shares of restricted common stock vest 20% upon issuance, 20% one year after the grant date, and in equal monthly installments thereafter over the next three years from the date of each agreement. The remaining 4,665,000 restricted common stock vest 25% one year from the date of the agreement and in equal monthly installments thereafter over three years. Vesting will accelerate upon certain change in control events. In the event that the business relationship is not maintained or that employment is terminated, the Company has the right to repurchase the unvested shares at the original purchase price. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-23, , the Company has classified the proceeds related to the unvested restricted stock as a liability until such time as the restrictions lapse. No shares were repurchased during 2006, and at December 31, 2006 no shares of restricted common stock were subject to repurchase.

8. Income Taxes
The Company provides for federal and state income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of the deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization.

As of December 31, 2006, the components of the Company's net deferred taxes were as follows:
At December 31, 2006, the Company had available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $65,196,000. These loss carryforwards may be utilized to offset future taxable income at various dates beginning in 2007 through 2027. They begin to expire in 2022 and 2007, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $3,239,000. These credit carryforwards may be utilized to offset future taxable income at various dates beginning in 2007 through 2027. They begin to expire in 2022 and 2017, respectively.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership may result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which may be utilized in future years.
9. 401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN
In 2002, the Company adopted the Acopia Networks, Inc. and Subsidiary 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the Plan). All employees who are 21 years of age are eligible to contribute 1% to 90% of their annual compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company may elect to make discretionary contributions to the Plan. There have been no discretionary contributions made by the Company to date.
10. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In 2006, the Company sold product and services to a customer who is also a stockholder for approximately $371,500. No revenue was recognized for this transaction during 2006. The Company recognized revenue of approximately $28,200 during 2006 relating to prior year sales. The Company believes that these transactions were negotiated at arms-length.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Acopia Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") was incorporated on December 26, 2001, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company is a developer of network switch equipment and software, which is used by large enterprises to enhance performance and gain efficiencies for existing server and storage systems.
The Company is subject to a number of risks common to companies at its stage and in its industry, including, but not limited to, the uncertainty of obtaining additional financing, competition from larger companies, the uncertainty of successful development and market acceptance of products, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, and the uncertainty of future profitability. For the six month period ended June 30, 2007, the Company incurred losses of approximately $12.3 million; and as of June 30, 2007, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $85.5 million. The Company has funded these losses primarily through equity financings. Based upon the Company's current plans, the Company will be required to obtain additional funding, or alternative means of financial support or both prior to December 31, 2007 in order to sustain operations. These factors raise substantial doubt concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently pursuing various sources of financial support, including obtaining funds through an additional equity financing and believes that it will be able to obtain the additional financing. However, there can be no assurances that such funding or financial support will be available or adequate to allow the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
On August 6, 2007, F5 Networks, Inc., a global application delivery networking company, signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of Acopia Networks, Inc., for approximately $210 million cash. The transaction is expected to close on or shortly after September 14, 2007, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions.
Basis of Presentation
The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for their fair statement in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information included in this Interim Report should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
SFAS No. 130, , requires companies to report comprehensive income (loss) as a measure of overall performance. Comprehensive income (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income was immaterial for disclosure purposes.
Reporting Comprehensive Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), , (SFAS No. 123R) to account for all stock options granted to employees and non-employees. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company had accounted for options to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation associated with stock awards to employees is determined as the difference, if any, between the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date stock compensation is measured and the price an employee must pay to exercise the award. As the Company previously accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value and used the minimum value method for disclosures of the fair value of awards under SFAS No. 123, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the prospective method. Under the prospective method, the Company applies the requirements of SFAS No. 123R prospectively to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the January 1, 2006 implementation date. Accordingly, results for fiscal years prior to January 1, 2006 do not include, and have not been restated to reflect, amounts associated with the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. The Company continues to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards, which was the intrinsic method, unless such awards are modified. Stock-based compensation to certain non-employees is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R, utilizing the measurement guidance of EITF 96-18 .
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services
The Company has recorded total stock-based compensation expense of approximately $484,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007. Stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the Statement of Operations as follows:
As of June 30, 2007, there was approximately $2.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements to be recognized in future periods. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Fair Value Measurement
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible items at fair market value as of specified election dates. Among the items eligible for such measurement are investments in subsidiaries and variable interest entities that an entity is required to consolidate, obligations under employee benefit plans, lease obligations, and various financial instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
 
currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, , which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.

Exhibit 99.3
INDEX TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
Unless specifically stated otherwise, the following information and all other information contained in this current report on form 8-K/A, gives effect to the two-for-one forward stock split by F5 Networks affected on August 10, 2007.
On September 12, 2007, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks") completed its previously announced acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc. ("Acopia"), a privately held Delaware corporation that provides high-performance, intelligent file virtualization solutions. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 6, 2007, by and among F5 Networks, Checkmate Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5 Networks, Acopia, and the stockholders' representative referred to therein (the "Merger Agreement"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Checkmate Acquisition Corporation merged with and into Acopia with Acopia surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5 Networks. The aggregate purchase price payable to the former Acopia stockholders and holders of vested in-the-money Acopia stock options was approximately $210.0 million in cash, less $2.5 million in transaction fees incurred by Acopia. $21.0 million of the aggregate merger consideration will be held in escrow to secure claims by F5 Networks for indemnification under the Merger Agreement. Prior to the closing of the Merger, there were no material relationships between or among F5 Networks or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the one hand, and Acopia or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the other. The acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provision of SFAS no. 141 "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets."
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 is based on the historical balance sheets of F5 Networks and Acopia and have been prepared to reflect the acquisition and related cash payments as if it had been consummated on June 30, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 combines F5 Networks and Acopia's historical consolidated statement of operations as if it had been consummated on October 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for fiscal year 2006 combined F5 Networks consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 with Acopia's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 as if it had been consummated on October 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and for fiscal 2006 both include Acopia's consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2006.
  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the Acquisition had been completed on an earlier date, and should not be taken as representative of future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of F5 Networks. Preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for all periods presented required management to make certain judgments and estimates to determine the pro forma adjustments, such as purchase accounting adjustments, which include, among others, amortization charges from acquired intangible assets.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of F5 Networks and Acopia (included herein) and other financial information pertaining to F5 Networks included in its respective annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
 
 
 
 
1.   Basis of Presentation
     On September 12, 2007, F5 Networks completed its previously announced merger with Acopia whereby Acopia became a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5 Networks in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations." Under this method of accounting, the total purchase price, including transaction cost of approximately $2.2 million, was approximately $210.0 million.
     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, on the effective date of the merger, each Acopia stock option that was outstanding and unexercised was converted into an option to purchase F5 Networks common stock and F5 Networks assumed that stock option in accordance with the terms of the applicable Acopia stock option plan and terms of the stock option agreement relating to that Acopia stock option. Based on Acopia's stock options outstanding at September 12, 2007, F5 Networks converted options to purchase approximately 6.4 million shares of Acopia common stock into options to purchase approximately 422,000 shares of F5 Networks common stock.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the Acquisition had been completed on an earlier date, and should not be taken as representative of future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of F5 Networks. Preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for all periods presented required management to make certain judgments and estimates to determine the pro forma adjustments, such as purchase accounting adjustments, which include, among others, amortization charges from acquired intangible assets.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheets as of June 30, 2007 are based on the historical balance sheets of F5 Networks and Acopia and have been prepared to reflect the acquisition and related cash payments as if it had been consummated on June 30, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 combines F5 Networks and Acopia's historical consolidated statement of operations as if it had been consummated on October 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for fiscal year 2006 combined F5 Networks consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 with Acopia's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 as if it had been consummated on October 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and for fiscal 2006 both include Acopia's consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2006.
     The pro forma information does not reflect cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements expected to result from the Acquisition or the costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements.
2.   Purchase Price Allocation
     Under the purchase method of accounting the total purchase price has been allocated to Acopia's tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at September 12, 2007. The change in tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from June 30, 2007 to the purchase price date of September 12, 2007 was due primarily a change in working capital in the normal course of business. Management of F5 Networks has allocated the purchase price with the assistance of an independent valuation of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities of Acopia purchased in the business combination. Based upon the valuation the total purchase price was allocated as follows (in thousands):
 
 
     The allocation of the purchase price and the estimated useful lives associated with certain assets is as follows (in thousands):
       Developed technologies relate to Acopia products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility and include processes and trade secrets acquired or developed through design and development of their products. To determine the value of the developed technology, a combination of cost and mark approach were used. The cost approach required an estimation of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The market approach measures the fair value of the technology through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. Customer relationships represent existing contracts that related primarily to underlying customer relationships. Trade name primarily relates to the Acopia and other product names. Covenant not to compete relates to an agreement with a certain former employee. The method of future amortization will be based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed.
Identifiable intangible assets.
       Approximately $152.0 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, , goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In
Goodwill.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
the event that the management of the combined company determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
     .  Approximately $14.0 million has been allocated to in-process research and development. As of the merger date, one project was in development that has not reached technological feasibility and therefore qualifies as in-process research and development. The amount allocated to in-process research and development will be charged to the statement of operations in the period the merger is consummated in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method." This amount is excluded from the pro forma condensed combined statements of income as it is not expected to have a continuing impact on operations.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 23, 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2007. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On January 23, 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. announced that its board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to $200 million of the company's outstanding common stock. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq:FFIV) announced revenue of $154.2 million, up 6 percent from $145.6 million in the prior quarter and 28 percent from $120.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 23, 2008
GAAP net income was $17.8 million ($0.21 per diluted share), compared to $12.9 million ($0.15 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $22.4 million ($0.26 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
Excluding stock-based compensation and in-process research and development expenses, non-GAAP net income was $28.8 million ($0.33 per diluted share), compared to $34.1 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $29.3 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statement of Operations.
"In EMEA we saw strong growth in demand for both our core application delivery networking products and our recently acquired line of ARX file virtualization devices," said John McAdam, president and chief executive officer. "Demand for ARX was also strong among large enterprise customers in North America, where we made modest gains in our core business as well. Growth in EMEA and North America was offset by sequential revenue declines in APAC and Japan, where sales of our core products slowed and we are in the early stages of rolling out ARX.
"Although revenue came in at the low end of our target range, the company's disciplined business model and our ability to manage expenses in line with daily changes in revenue expectations enabled us to hit the top of our earnings target. In addition, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew just under 10% to
 
$110.2 million at quarter end. Cash flow from operations was $42.0 million, and the company ended the quarter with $517 million in cash and investments."
Despite signs of a weaker global economy, McAdam said he believes the company's business is fundamentally sound and management remains confident that F5 can continue to grow sequentially throughout fiscal 2008.
"Today's introduction of VIPRION, our chassis-based application delivery controller, extends the high end of our product portfolio and further widens our competitive lead in performance and functionality. We believe VIPRION has the potential to open up new opportunities not only in telecommunications and internet service providers but in large enterprises that require a complete application-fluent infrastructure that is simple to deploy and manage."
"Facing the likelihood of constrained data center spending over the next several quarters, we believe both our BIG-IP application delivery controllers and our ARX file virtualization products offer high value and a compelling return on investment by enabling customers to spend less on other types of information technology and reduce their overall costs."
For the current quarter, ending March 31, 2008, McAdam said management has set a revenue goal of $158 million to $160 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.21 to $0.22 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.33 to $0.34 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:
Share Repurchase Program
The company also announced today that its board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to $200 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range,share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and file virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties , as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and data solutions offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income
 
excluding stock-based compensation and in-process research and development expenses, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation and in-process research and development expense. Net income excluding stock-based compensation and in-process research and development expense (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment." In-process research and development expense ("IPR&D") is a non-recurring, non-cash expense which reflects the amount allocated to IPR&D that the company acquired in connection with its acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc.
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation and in-process research and development expense (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 23, 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2008. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) announced revenue of $159.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, up 3 percent from $154.2 million in the prior quarter and 25 percent from $127.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
SEATTLE, WAApril 23, 2008
GAAP net income was $17.7 million ($0.21 per diluted share), compared to $17.8 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $20.0 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income was $28.9 million ($0.35 per diluted share), compared to $28.8 million ($0.33 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $29.2 million ($0.34 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Overall, F5 achieved solid results in both our core application delivery controller business and our recently acquired storage virtualization business," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Application delivery controller revenue grew sequentially in Q2 and was up 19% from Q2 a year ago. Revenue from ARX, our line of storage virtualization products, also grew sequentially, up 5 percent from the prior quarter."
McAdam said the company's core business grew despite unexpected weakness in Japan. "In what has historically been Japan's strongest quarter, Japan revenue was down sequentially from Q1. US Federal and Telco revenue also came in below our expectations. However, excluding Federal and Telco, North American revenue was up sequentially from the prior quarter. In addition, we saw continuing strength in EMEA, where revenue grew 9 percent sequentially, and APAC, where revenue increased 23 percent from Q1.
 
"In its first full quarter, sales of VIPRION, our chassis-based application delivery controller, were in line with our expectations, and demand continues to build during the current quarter. VIPRION's scalability, high performance, and rich functionality address the massive throughput requirements of large internet service and information providers that are struggling to keep pace with growing numbers of users and the increasing volume and complexity of online content. With a growing pipeline and an increasing number of customer evaluations, VIPRION appears to be gaining traction and promises to be a significant driver of our core business," McAdam said.
Reflecting high marks on the company's most recent customer survey, services revenue continued to grow at a healthy pace in the second quarter. In addition, deferred revenue, consisting primarily of unamortized service revenue, grew 11 percent from the prior period to $122.6 million.
Cash flow from operations was $36.9 million during the quarter, and after repurchasing $100 million of F5 shares, the company ended the quarter with $450 million in cash and investments.
Although management remains confident in the company's ability to achieve sequential revenue growth, McAdam said current economic weakness could slow the company's growth in the third quarter, ending June 30, 2008. Accordingly, management has set a revenue goal of $160 million to $162 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.21 to $0.22 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.34 to $0.35 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash
 
expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 23, 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2008. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $165.6 million, up 4 percent from $159.1 million in the prior quarter and 25 percent from $132.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 23, 2008
GAAP net income was $19.1 million ($0.23 per diluted share), compared to $17.7 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $21.8 million ($0.26 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $30.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share), compared to $28.9 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $30.3 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"During the third quarter, we saw continued strengthening in our core application delivery controller (ADC) business" said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer.
"As we anticipated, our chassis-based VIPRION controller was a key driver of product revenue growth. Sales of VIPRION were especially robust among large internet content and service providers, and we continue to see strong demand heading into the close of fiscal 2008. With VIPRION contributing to strong sales at the high end of our product line, we believe our new entry-level ADC products, announced today, will have a positive impact on our low-end sales. BIG-IP 1600 and BIG-IP 3600 represent the first phase of a complete platform refresh that will roll out during fiscal 2009, delivering higher performance and more functionality across our ADC product line."
 
Along with solid revenue and earnings growth, balance sheet highlights for the third quarter included a 13 percent increase in deferred revenue to $139 million and $56 million in cash flow from operations. After repurchasing another $50 million of the company's outstanding common stock, F5 ended the quarter with $447 million in cash and investments.
Despite continuing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, McAdam said he is encouraged by the company's solid third quarter results and the prospect of further improvement driven by new products. For the current quarter management has set a revenue goal of $172 million to $174 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.19 to $0.20 per diluted share. Management's GAAP earnings target includes a charge of $5.3 million related to a loss on facility exit and sublease ($3.3 million net of tax).  Excluding this charge and stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.38 to $0.39 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, ended September 30. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be $171.3 million, below the company's guidance of $172 million  $174 million. The company expects to meet or exceed its GAAP and non-GAAP EPS targets for the quarter.
SEATTLE, WAOctober 7, 2008
John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said results for the fourth quarter reflect further weakening in the financial vertical and a sharp slowdown in Europe during the last week of September, partially offset by a slight rebound in Japan and US Federal revenues and by strong demand for the company's new entry-level products.
"Despite weakness in the global economy, demand for the BIG-IP 3600 in particular was much stronger than we initially anticipated," McAdam said. "During the month of September alone BIG-IP 3600 sales exceeded our initial forecast for the entire quarter, resulting in more orders than we could ship during the quarter."
McAdam also said the company saw continued strong demand for VIPRION, the high-end of its BIG-IP product family, among large enterprises and internet content and service providers.
During the quarter, the company's balance sheet continued to strengthen. Cash flow from operations exceeded $50 million. After purchasing an additional $50 million of F5 stock, the company ended the quarter with cash and investments in excess of $450 million.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibit is filed as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K:
3.1 Amendment to sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the Bylaws of F5 Networks, Inc.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 3.1
Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the Bylaws of F5 Networks, Inc. are amended and restated in their entirety as follows:
     3.3 ELECTION. At each annual shareholders' meeting the shareholders shall elect the directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
     Except as provided in Section 3.4 and in this paragraph, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. A contested election is one in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
     The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority vote shall not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote shall continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of (a) ninety (90) days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to RCW 23B.07.035(2); (b) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by such director, which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 3.4; or (c) the date of the director's resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director under this Section 3.3 may be filled by the Board of Directors as provided in Section 3.4. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee failing to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and within ninety (90) days after the certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Except as provided in the next sentence, no director who failed to receive a majority vote for election will participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board decision about filling his or her office. If no director receives a majority vote in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (a) will nominate a slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable, and (b) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same director(s) who will continue in office until their successors are elected.
 
     3.4 VACANCIES. Unless otherwise provided by the Washington Business Corporation Act, in case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors or non-election of a director pursuant to Section 3.3, the remaining directors, whether constituting a quorum or not, may fill the vacancy.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAOctober 22, 2008F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $171.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, up 3 percent from $165.6 million in the prior quarter and 18 percent from $145.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. For fiscal year 2008, revenue was $650.2 million, up 24 percent from $525.7 million in fiscal 2007.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $19.7 million ($0.24 per diluted share) compared to $19.1 million ($0.23 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2008 and $12.9 million ($0.15 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP net income for the year was $74.3 million ($0.89 per diluted share) versus $77.0 million ($0.90 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2007.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and a non-recurring loss on facility exit and sublease, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $33.4 million ($0.41 per diluted share), compared to $30.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $34.1 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 (which also excluded in-process research and development expenses related to the company's acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc. in September 2007). For fiscal year 2008, non-GAAP net income was $121.3 million ($1.45 per diluted share) versus $122.9 million ($1.44 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2007.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Noting that the fourth quarter of 2008 marked F5's 23 consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth, president and chief executive officer John McAdam said he was generally pleased with the results in the context of a difficult global economy.
rd
"Although fourth quarter revenue was slightly below our expectations and guidance, robust demand for our new entry-level products outstripped our ability to fill all the orders we received during the quarter and resulted in a significant year-end backlog of orders for those products. Despite lower than expected revenue, our non-GAAP operating margin continued to improve, and earnings exceeded our targets on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis," McAdam said.
 
During the fourth quarter, F5 also continued to strengthen its balance sheet. Deferred revenue, principally from service maintenance contracts, was $145 million at year end. Cash flow from operations was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $194 million for the year. During fiscal 2008, the company repurchased $200 million of F5 common stock and ended the year with $451 million in cash and investments.
For first quarter of fiscal 2009, ending December 31, the company has set a revenue target of $172 million to $174 million and a GAAP earnings target of $0.26 to $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.41 to $0.42 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:
st
Share Repurchase Program
The company also announced today that its board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional $200 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
 
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment." In addition, in-process research and development ("IPR&D") expenses and a loss on facility exit and sublease have been excluded from GAAP net income for the purpose of measuring non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share in the fourth fiscal quarters of 2007 and 2008, respectively. IPR&D is a non-recurring, non-cash expense which reflects the amount allocated to IPR&D that the company acquired in connection with its acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc. in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007. The loss on facility exit and sublease is a non-recurring loss related to the closure of F5's office in Bellevue, Washington and the subleasing of a portion of the office space in the 333 Elliott West building in Seattle, Washington in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008.
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation, in-process research and development and non-recurring one-time losses such as those related to the facility exit and sublease (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to
 
look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, ended December 31. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be $165.6 million, below the company's guidance of $172 million  $174 million. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.26 to $0.27 per diluted share, consistent with original guidance. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.40 to $0.41 per diluted share, as compared with original guidance of $0.41 to $0.42 per diluted share.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 6, 2009
John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said the revenue shortfall resulted primarily from a fall-off in North American sales at quarter-end. "International revenue was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and total revenue was generally on track until the last week of December, when a number of anticipated orders from certain customers in North America did not come through."
McAdam said the company's sales management team is evaluating each of these anticipated orders to identify primary causes of the slowdown and the company expects to provide more specific information during its regularly scheduled conference call on January 21, 2009.
While overall product sales were below the company's internal forecast, sales of new entry-level products remained strong, and demand for BIG-IP 6900, launched in late October, were in line with expectations.
Deferred revenue, consisting primarily of unamortized service revenue, grew $11 million to $156 million. Cash flow from operations topped $57 million, and after purchasing $20 million of F5 common stock the company ended the quarter with cash and investments in excess of $487 million.
 
A reconciliation of the company's anticipated GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $32.3 million ($0.40 per diluted share), compared to $33.4 million ($0.41 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $28.8 million ($0.33 per diluted share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"As we announced on January 6, the primary reason for the revenue shortfall was a sudden fall-off in North American sales during the last week of December," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Our current analysis indicates that most of these deals were pushed into our second or third quarter of 2009 due to budget constraints. However, several were postponed indefinitely as customers evaluate their expense budgets in light of the continued recession."
th
McAdam said he was pleased that during the quarter the company continued to maintain solid margins, achieved its earnings targets, and generated strong cash flow.
During the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $57.9 million. After repurchasing $20 million of F5 common stock, the company ended the year with $487.4 million in cash and investments.
Given the likelihood of continued uncertainty and further slowing in the overall economy, McAdam said management has lowered its expectations for the current quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, ending March 31, the company has set a revenue target of $157 million to $164 million and a
st
 
GAAP earnings target of $0.19 to $0.21 per diluted share. Management expects to record a $4.5 to $5.5 million (pre-tax) restructuring charge in the second quarter related to a loss on facility exit, workforce reduction and accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements. Excluding this charge and stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.36 to $0.38 per diluted share. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP earnings targets for the second quarter reflect the anticipated return to a normalized effective tax rate, which was lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 due to the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and
 
storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors
 
should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
The reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP second quarter earnings also excludes a restructuring charge related to a loss on facility exit, workforce reduction and accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements. This restructuring charge will be incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2009 in connection with a reduction in the company's workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company's office space.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 and the exhibit hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, ended March 31. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be $154.1 million, below the company's guidance of $157 million  $164 million. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.23 to $0.24 per diluted share, exceeding the company's guidance of $0.19  $0.21 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.37 to $0.38 per diluted share, within the company's guided range of $0.36 to $0.38 per diluted share.
SEATTLE, WAApril 7, 2009
According to John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, sales during the second quarter were slower than expected across all geographic regions. Revenue from the company's application delivery controller business was flat compared with the second quarter of last year but down sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Revenue from the company's file virtualization business was down year over year but grew approximately 23 percent sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Despite the slowdown in overall sales, the company expects to meet its non-GAAP gross margin targets for the quarter. However, as a result of an accrual for a legal settlement, the company expects its GAAP gross margin to be slightly below management's guided range of 77-78%. As a result of aggressive cost-reduction and expense-control measures, the company expects to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin above 27% for the quarter, exceeding its target of 25%.
Cash flow from operations is expected to be $39 million, above the company's guidance of $35 million, and after purchasing $27.4 million of F5 common stock the company ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $499 million.

          To the extent that any payment or benefit pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a 409A Payment treated as payable upon Separation from Service, then, if on the date of the Executive's Separation from Service, the Executive is a Specified Employee, then to the extent required for the Executive not to incur additional taxes pursuant to Code Section 409A, no such 409A Payment shall be made to the Executive earlier than the earlier of (a) six (6) months after the Executive's Separation from Service or (b) the date of the Executive's death. Should this Section 19 result in the delay of benefits, any such benefit shall be made available to the Executive by the Company during such delay period at the Executive's expense. Should this Section 19.1 result in a delay of payments or benefits to the Executive, on the first day any such payments or benefits may be made without incurring additional tax pursuant to Code Section 409A (the ""), the Company shall make such payments and provide such benefits as provided for in this Agreement, provided that any amounts that would have been payable earlier but for the application of this Section 19.1 as well as reimbursement of the amount the Executive paid for benefits pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall be paid in a lump sum on the 409A Payment Date. For purposes of this Section 19.1, the term "" shall have the meaning set forth in Code Section 409A, as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company.

          For purposes of complying with Code Section 409A and without extending the payment timing otherwise provided in this Agreement, taxable reimbursements under this Agreement, subject to the following sentence and to the extent required to comply with Code Section 409A,
 
will be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year the expense was incurred. To the extent required to comply with Code Section 409A, any taxable reimbursements and any in-kind benefit under this Agreement will be subject to the following: (a) payment of such reimbursements or in-kind benefits during one calendar year will not affect the amount of such reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided during any other calendar year (other than for medical reimbursement arrangements as excepted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv)(B) solely because the arrangement provides for a limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under such arrangement over some or all of the period the arrangement remains in effect); (b) such right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another form of compensation to the Executive; and (c) the right to reimbursements under this Agreement will be in effect for the lesser of the time specified in this Agreement or ten (10) years plus the lifetime of the Executive. Any taxable reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be treated as not subject to Code Section 409A to the maximum extent provided by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) or otherwise under Code Section 409A.
          
19.3 Release.
          Subject to Section 19.1 hereof, (a) to the extent that the Executive is required to execute and deliver a release to receive a 409A Payment and (b) this Agreement provides for such 409A Payment to be provided prior to the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, such 409A Payment will be provided upon the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, provided that the release in the form acceptable to the Company, in its reasonable discretion, has been executed, delivered and effective prior to such time. To the extent there is a delay in providing a 409A Payment because of the provisions of this Section 19.3, interest for the delay and the opportunity for the Executive to pay for benefits in the interim with subsequent reimbursement from the Company shall be provided in a manner consistent with that set forth in Section 19.1 hereof. If a release is required for a 409A Payment and such release is not executed, delivered and effective by the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, such 409A Payment shall not be provided to the Executive to the extent that providing such 409A Payment would cause such 409A Payment to fail to comply with Code Section 409A.
          
19.4 No Acceleration; Separate Payments.
          No 409A Payment payable under this Agreement shall be subject to acceleration or to any change in the specified time or method of payment, except as otherwise provided under this Agreement and consistent with Code Section 409A. If under this Agreement, a 409A Payment is to be paid in two or more installments, for purposes of Section 409A, each installment shall be treated as a separate payment.
     
20. Counterparts
          This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 22, 2009, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2009. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2009, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $158.2 million, up 2.6 percent from $154.1 million in the prior quarter and down 4.4 percent from $165.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 22, 2009
GAAP net income was $22.8 million ($0.29 per diluted share), compared to $19.0 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $19.1 million ($0.23 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $31.9 million ($0.40 per diluted share), compared to $30.3 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $30.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"While it is still too early to say that the worst is behind us, customer buying patterns did appear to stabilize during the third quarter," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer.
"As a result, we were able to grow revenue sequentially and exceed our revenue target. Coupled with better top-line performance, modest gross margin improvement and ongoing expense controls further improved our non-GAAP operating margin and enabled us to exceed both our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings targets as well," McAdam said.
During the third quarter, the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet, increasing deferred revenue 6 percent to $170 million and generating $46 million in cash flow from operations. After repurchasing another $15.9 million of the company's outstanding common stock, F5 ended the quarter with $538 million in cash and investments.
 
Acknowledging that weakness and uncertainty in the global economy persist, McAdam said he is encouraged by the company's third quarter results. For the current quarter, management has set a revenue goal of $160 million to $164 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.40 to $0.42 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products
 
and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
 
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 21, 2009, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2009. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAOctober 21, 2009F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $175.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, up 11 percent from $158.2 million in the prior quarter and 2 percent from $171.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. For fiscal year 2009, revenue was $653.1 million, up slightly from $650.2 million in fiscal year 2008.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $28.4 million ($0.36 per diluted share) compared to $22.8 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2009 and $19.7 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP net income for the year was $91.5 million ($1.14 per diluted share) versus $74.3 million ($0.89 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2008.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $40.0 million ($0.50 per diluted share), compared to $31.9 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $33.4 million ($0.41 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 (which also excluded a non-recurring loss on facility exit and sublease). For fiscal year 2009, non-GAAP net income was $134.6 million ($1.68 per diluted share) versus $121.3 million ($1.45 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2008.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the rebound in revenue growth during the quarter reflected a continuation of the trend toward more normal customer spending patterns that the company experienced in the prior quarter. "Bookings were up across all geographic regions, especially in North America, as customers began purchasing equipment for new projects and moving forward with projects they had put on hold during the first half of the year. In addition, growing awareness of the performance and functionality of TMOS version 10 helped drive strong demand for our new family of BIG-IP application delivery controllers and the growth of product revenue, which increased nearly 14 percent from Q3.
 
"During Q4, a slight increase in gross margins combined with strong revenue growth to drive our non-GAAP operating margin to just under 32 percent. As a result, earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis came in well above our guidance for the quarter.
"We also saw continued improvement on our balance sheet. Deferred revenue grew 7.8 percent to $183.1 million from the prior quarter and cash flow from operations was $58.6 million. Cash flow for the full year was $202 million, and after repurchasing 3.3 million shares of F5 common stock for $87.4 million in fiscal year 2009 we ended the year with $574 million in cash and investments.
"In general, Q4 was a strong finish to a challenging year. While it is still too early to rule out the possibility of another broad economic setback, the strength of our current business and our growing pipeline are encouraging signs that the positive trends we saw in the last two quarters will continue through fiscal 2010."
For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, ending December 31, the company has set a revenue target of $182 million to $187 million and a GAAP earnings target of $0.31 to $0.33 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.47 to $0.49 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Equity Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification.
The reconciliation of the company's GAAP and non-GAAP annual earnings also excludes a restructuring charge related to a loss on facility exit and workforce reduction and a legal settlement charge, both of which were incurred during the second quarter. This restructuring charge was incurred in connection with a reduction in the company's workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company's office space.
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results.

Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $41.4 million ($0.52 per diluted share), compared to $40.0 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $32.3 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"For the second quarter in a row, strong product sales continued to drive our top-line growth," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "During the first quarter, F5's product revenue grew 9.5 percent compared to the prior quarter and 10.5 percent year-over-year. With the exception of Japan, results were strong across all regions and especially in North America, where overall revenue was up 12 percent from the prior quarter and 24 percent compared to the first quarter a year ago. Our business in EMEA continues to be quite strong, with a 20 percent increase in revenue from last quarter and a 15 percent increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
"Because our products are strategic points of control in data centers, the initial purchase and renewal of service maintenance contracts continues to be a strong component of our business, driving deferred revenue up 15.5 percent during the quarter to $211.4 million.
 
"The combination of strong revenue growth and stable gross margins enabled us to add nearly 100 employees in Q1 while maintaining our non-GAAP operating margin at just under 32 percent.
"During the quarter we generated $74 million in cash from operations, and after repurchasing 309,160 shares of our outstanding common stock we ended the quarter with $647 million in cash and investments.
"While seasonal factors typically make the second quarter our most challenging quarter, customer buying patterns continue to stabilize and our near-term business outlook remains strong," McAdam said.
For the current quarter, ending on March 31, management has set a revenue goal of $195 million to $200 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.36 to $0.38 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.52 to $0.54 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Equity Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification.
 
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $206.1 million, up 7.8 percent from $191.2 million in the prior quarter and 33.7 percent from $154.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
SEATTLE, WAApril 21, 2010
GAAP net income was $33.1 million ($0.41 per diluted share), compared to $29.3 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $19.0 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $45.2 million ($0.56 per diluted share), compared to $41.4 million ($0.52 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $30.3 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Demand for our BIG-IP family of application delivery controllers continued to strengthen in the second quarter," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Total product revenue increased 9 percent compared to the prior quarter and 38 percent year-over-year. Revenues were up sequentially across all regions. Revenue from EMEA and the Americas grew 37 percent and 40 percent respectively on a year-over-year basis."
Reflecting both the high number of service maintenance contracts generated by new product sales and the high renewal rate on existing maintenance contracts, deferred revenue increased to $226.5 million, up 7 percent from the prior quarter and 41 percent from the second quarter a year ago.
 
As a result of continued strong revenue growth and stable gross margins, the company was able to add 80 employees in the second quarter while increasing its non-GAAP operating margin to just over 32 percent.
During the second quarter, the company generated $78 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 364,958 shares of its outstanding common stock the company ended the quarter with $712 million in cash and investments.
"Looking out to the second half of fiscal 2010, we continue to see strong demand for our products as the economy recovers and customers look to enhance their productivity and competitiveness by leveraging technologies that require more intelligence and greater control in their networks," McAdam said.
For the current quarter, ending on June 30, management has set a revenue goal of $214 million to $219 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.42 to $0.44 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $230.5 million, up 11.8 percent from $206.1 million in the prior quarter and 45.7 percent from $158.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 21, 2010
GAAP net income was $40.5 million ($0.50 per diluted share), compared to $33.1 million ($0.41 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $22.8 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP net income was $53.3 million ($0.66 per diluted share), compared to $45.2 million ($0.56 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $31.9 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Strengthening demand for our BIG-IP family of application delivery controllers continued to drive strong year-over-year revenue growth across all regions," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer.
"BIG-IP product revenue was up 13 percent compared to the prior quarter and 57 percent compared to the third quarter of last year. In addition, we saw solid sequential revenue growth from our ARX file virtualization products.
"During the quarter, we enhanced and enlarged our product portfolio with the introduction of TMOS version 10.2, designed to help customers extend enterprise data center architecture to the cloud and integrate disparate technologies for application delivery, security, optimization, data management, and infrastructure control. We also added two new high-end platforms to
 
our BIG-IP appliance offerings and introduced our BIG-IP LTM VE virtual appliance. All of these new products have been well received by customers, and BIG-IP LTM VE has helped drive hardware sales by allowing customers to test BIG-IP in their networks before they purchase production systems."
McAdam said the company also continued to see solid growth in its services business. During the quarter, services revenue grew 9 percent sequentially and 33 percent year over year. Reflecting the growth of new and renewed service maintenance contracts booked during the quarter, deferred revenue increased to $239.6 million, up 6 percent from the prior quarter and 41 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Strong revenue growth and further improvement in product gross margin enabled the company to add approximately 80 employees in the third quarter while achieving a non-GAAP operating margin of 33.6 percent.
During the quarter, the company generated $75 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 291,027 shares of its outstanding common stock the company ended the quarter with $781 million in cash and investments.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, ending September 30, management has set a revenue goal of $242 million to $247 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.53 to $0.55 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.69 to $0.71 per diluted share.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding,
 
as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 Compensation  Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
The reconciliation of the company's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings for the nine months ended June 30, 2009 also excludes a restructuring charge related to a loss on facility exit and workforce reduction and a legal settlement charge, both of which were incurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. This restructuring charge was incurred in connection with a reduction in the company's workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company's office space.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WAOctober 26, 2010F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $254.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, up 10 percent from $230.5 million in the prior quarter and 45 percent from $175.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For fiscal year 2010, revenue was $882.0 million, up 35 percent from $653.1 million in fiscal year 2009.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $48.2 million ($0.59 per diluted share) compared to $40.5 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2010 and $28.4 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP net income for the year was $151.2 million ($1.86 per diluted share) versus $91.5 million ($1.14 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2009.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and a one-time charge related to a legal settlement, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $63.9 million ($0.79 per diluted share), compared to $53.3 million ($0.66 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $40.0 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal year 2010, non-GAAP net income was $203.8 million ($2.51 per diluted share) versus $134.6 million ($1.68 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2009.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said that during the fourth quarter the company continued to benefit from several key trends that drove demand for its products throughout fiscal 2010. "As enterprises and other large organizations confront the new realities of today's global economy, they are turning increasingly to technologies that enable them to operate more efficiently and compete more successfully by giving them flexible, on-demand access to more resources while reducing overall costs. This shift is reflected broadly in the trend towards data center consolidation and the widespread adoption of server virtualization and new infrastructure models such as cloud computing.
 
"Within the past year, these trends have accelerated, and our products have been increasingly deployed as strategic points of control in new data center architectures, integrating disparate resources and managing the flow of traffic within and between data centers. In addition, we have continued to see growing demand for our products among service providers grappling with the proliferation of mobile devices, the explosion of mobile applications and the corresponding increase in mobile data traffic. As a result, our product revenues grew 12 percent sequentially in Q4 and 38 percent during fiscal 2010," said McAdam.
During the fourth quarter, further improvement in gross margins combined with strong revenue growth to drive the company's GAAP operating margin to 30 percent and the non-GAAP operating margin to just under 38 percent.
On the company's balance sheet, deferred revenue grew 8 percent sequentially to $259.4 million, up nearly 42 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Cash flow from operations was $86 million in the fourth quarter and $314 million for the full year. After repurchasing $75 million of F5 common stock in fiscal 2010, the company ended the year with $862 million in cash and investments.
"In general, Q4 was a strong finish to a strong year," McAdam said. "Barring another broad economic setback, the strength of our current business and our growing pipeline are encouraging signs that the positive trends that drove our business in fiscal 2010 will continue through fiscal 2011."
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, ending December 31, the company has set a revenue target of $265 million to $270 million and a GAAP earnings target of $0.62 to $0.64 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, our non-GAAP earnings target is $0.80 to $0.82 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:
Share Repurchase Program
The company also announced today that its board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to $200 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
 
Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our
 
products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 Compensation  Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
The reconciliation of the company's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings for the three months and twelve months ended September 30, 2010 also excludes a legal settlement charge.
 
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

Sommer v. McAdam et al.
 
consolidated as , Master Case No. 06-2-17195-1 SEA (the "State Action"). On April 3, 2007, the King County Court also appointed Marilyn Adams as State Lead Plaintiff, and Schiffrin, Baroway, Topaz & Kessler LLP (now known as Barroway Topaz Kessler Meltzer & Check LLP) as lead counsel, in the State Action. At the same time, the State Action was stayed pending resolution of the Federal Action and remains stayed.
In re F5 Networks, Inc. State Court Derivative Litigation
The Federal Action and the State Action are referred to collectively in this Stipulation as the "Actions."
The Federal Action alleges claims on behalf of F5 against certain current and former officers and directors of F5, arising from or relating to the granting of stock options at F5, beginning as early as 1999. On October 25, 2006, F5 announced that a special committee had concluded after an internal investigation that the recorded grant dates for certain stock option grants made between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes. F5 further disclosed that the Company would likely need to restate its historical financial statements for fiscal years 1999-2005 "to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense" related to past stock option grants, and that "the [C]ompany's financial statements and earnings releases and similar financial communications relating to fiscal periods commencing on or after October 1, 1998, which is the first day of the [C]ompany's fiscal year 1999, and through the date of this release should no longer be relied upon." On November 8, 2006, F5 announced, among other things, that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2005 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22.9 million.
On November 26, 2006, Federal Lead Plaintiff filed its Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Consolidated Complaint"). The Consolidated Complaint asserted claims relating to the alleged backdating of stock option grant awards, and the issuance of allegedly false and misleading statements and other SEC reports allegedly designed to conceal such backdating from shareholders against certain of the Individual Defendants (as defined below in  IV(A)(10)).
 
 
On February 28, 2007, F5 moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint on the theory that a pre-suit demand on the F5 Board of Directors would not have been futile. More specifically, F5 argued that the Consolidated Complaint contained no allegations that F5's directors lacked independence or that they were sufficiently "interested" in the events at issue to disqualify them from exercising their business judgment.
Federal Lead Plaintiff opposed F5's motion, arguing that the Consolidated Complaint sufficiently alleged the reasons demand on the F5 Board would have been futile. On August 6, 2007, the Court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. On September 14, 2007, Federal Lead Plaintiff filed its Amended Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleged violations of the federal securities laws, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and state common law. F5 filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on November 16, 2007, again arguing that Federal Lead Plaintiff had not adequately alleged that demand on the F5 Board would have been futile, and Federal Lead Plaintiff filed an opposition on January 18, 2008. F5 filed its reply on February 19, 2008. On July 3, 2008, the Court certified two questions concerning Washington state law to the Washington Supreme Court. Following full briefing and oral argument by the parties, on May 21, 2009, the Washington Supreme Court issued its opinion on the certified questions. In October 2009, the Court requested supplemental briefing to address the impact of the Washington Supreme Court's opinion on F5's pending motion to dismiss. Following submission of such briefing, the parties agreed to attempt a mediation of the Action, and sought and were granted a suspension of the ruling on F5's motion to dismiss until after the mediation.
In June 2010, the parties to the Federal Action attended a mediation before the Honorable Layn Phillips (Ret.). Since the mediation, the parties have continued settlement negotiations to resolve the Action, and thereafter reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Actions.
As a result of the Federal Action and the settlement reflected in this Stipulation (the "Settlement"), F5 has instituted, or will institute, significant corporate governance reforms designed to enhance its internal controls and operations. Federal Lead Plaintiff, Federal Lead Counsel, and F5 believe that a settlement at this juncture on the terms and on the conditions set forth in this Stipulation is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of F5.
 
 
The Board of Directors of F5, in an exercise of its independent business judgment, approved the Settlement and each of its terms as fair, just and adequate, and in the best interest of F5 and its shareholders.
Federal Lead Plaintiff believes that the claims asserted in the Federal Action have merit. However, Federal Lead Counsel recognizes and acknowledges the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Actions through trial and through appeals. Federal Lead Counsel has also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Federal Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Federal Lead Counsel is also mindful of the inherent problems of proof and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Federal Action. Federal Lead Counsel believes that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon F5 and its shareholders. Based on their evaluation, Federal Lead Plaintiff and nominal party F5 have determined that the Settlement is in the best interests of F5 and its shareholders.
Defendants (as defined below in  IV(A)(4)) have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims and contentions alleged by Federal Lead Plaintiff in the Federal Action. Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them arising out of any of the conduct, statements, acts, or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Federal Action. Defendants also have denied and continue to deny, , the allegations that Federal Plaintiffs, F5, or its shareholders have suffered damage, or that Federal Plaintiffs, F5, or its shareholders were harmed by the conduct alleged in the Federal Action. Defendants have further asserted that at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of F5 and its shareholders.
inter alia
 
 
Nonetheless, Defendants have concluded that further conduct of the Federal Action would be protracted and expensive, and that it is desirable that the Federal Action be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation. Defendants agree to the Settlement without admitting any wrongdoing or liability.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and among Federal Plaintiff (as defined below in  IV(A)(8)) (for themselves and derivatively on behalf of F5), F5, and the Individual Defendants by and through their respective counsel or attorneys of record:

The Board shall adopt an equity-based compensation award policy that applies to all current and future equity incentive plans, whether or not subject to shareholder approval, providing for the following:
i. The policy shall clearly define the exercise price, the grant date, and the fair market value of stock (e.g., the closing price of the stock on a specified date, or the average closing price over a specified period). In no event will the exercise price or value of an award be determined by reference to the fair market value of F5 stock on a date other than the grant date of the award. The fair market value of F5 stock on a grant date will be defined as the closing price for a share of F5 common stock on such date as reported on the NASDAQ.
 
 
ii. The following clause will be included in the policy: "The date of grant of an equity award must, for all purposes, be no earlier than the date on which the Board or Compensation Committee makes the determination granting such award. Notice of the determination will be given to each employee or consultant to whom an equity award is so granted reasonably promptly following the grant date or by such date as may be required by applicable accounting standards. In no event will notice be given more than twenty (20) days after the date of such grant."
iii. The policy shall require compliance with legal, professional, and ethical requirements for proper disclosure and proper accounting.
iv. The policy shall require appropriate documentation for proper disclosure and accounting.
v.

vi. The Company shall maintain all records relating to all equity awards until at least seven (7) years after the expiration of the pertinent equity awards.
 
i. Authority to grant stock option awards to directors and executive officers, and authority to approve parameters for stock option awards for other employees, shall be limited to the full Board or a properly constituted Compensation Committee, consisting of solely independent directors.
ii. Grants to directors and any employee subject to  16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Covered Employees within the meaning of  162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall either be approved or be ratified by the full Board or the Compensation Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, as defined herein.

All such approvals shall occur on or prior to the New Hire Grant Date. The Board or the Compensation Committee, as applicable, at its discretion may also change in advance the annual grant dates and quarterly grant date for a given quarter, and shall disclose such change prior to the new annual grant date.
iv. For equity awards that require approval at times other than regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings (for example, in connection with the hiring of a senior executive or the closing of an acquisition or other strategic transaction), the Compensation Committee may approve equity grants by calling a special Compensation Committee meeting. The grant date for each such equity grant shall be no earlier than the date that the Compensation Committee holds the special meeting and concurrently approves the grant. When a special Compensation Committee meeting is not feasible, the Compensation Committee may approve equity grants by having the entire Compensation Committee approve such grants by written consent. The grant date for all such grants approved by written consent shall be no earlier than the date on which the written consent is complete and approved in writing (or by electronic transmission) by all Compensation Committee members. All written consents shall carry the date of when each signatory signed (or electronically approved) the consent.
v. The exercise price for any equity grants approved at times other than regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings shall be determined using the formula prescribed in the equity-based Compensation award policy described in  I.A. herein. The Compensation Committee will promptly inform the Board about any equity grants to executive officers approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
 
 
i. The Board's Committees shall have standing authorizations, at their discretion, to obtain legal or other advisors of their choice, who will report directly to the Board or the Committee.
ii. A nominee for director shall be elected by a vote of a majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee's election.
 
i. In the event that, and for as long as, the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person, the independent members of the Board shall annually elect an independent director to act in a lead capacity to coordinate the other independent directors, as described further below (the "Lead Independent Director"). The Lead Independent Director shall coordinate and moderate executive sessions of the Board's independent directors, and shall act as principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
ii. In addition to the duties applicable to all Board members (which will not be limited or diminished by the Lead Independent Director's role), the Lead Independent Director shall be responsible for the following functions:

i. Absent extraordinary circumstances, each member of the Board shall be required to attend each annual shareholder meeting in person.
ii. All qualified shareholder proposals shall be evaluated by the Company's General Counsel and a Committee of at least two independent directors, as defined herein, chaired by an independent Chairman.

Following such review, if the Board of Directors decides not to recover or cancel any portion of the awards at issue, that decision shall be disclosed in the Company's next annual proxy statement.

In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation
 
 
On , 2010, at .m., the Court will hold a hearing (the "Settlement Hearing") in the Federal Action. The purpose of the Settlement Hearing is to determine: (i) whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and should be approved; (ii) whether a final judgment should be entered; and (iii) such other matters as may be necessary or proper under the circumstances.
            
        
    
 
This is a shareholder derivative action that alleges claims based on F5's stock option grants and related acts and practices from 1999 through 2005. On June 8, 2006, plaintiff Glenn Hutton filed a complaint in the United States District Court Western District of Washington at Seattle : , Case No. 2:06-cv-00794-RSL. Thereafter, three other cases were consolidated with the Hutton case: , Case No. 2:06-cv-01057-TSZ; , Case No. 2:06-cv-01145-RSL; and , Case No. C07-1200-RSL.

In re F5 Networks, Inc. State Court Derivative Litigation
 
(the "State Action"). On April 3, 2007, the King County Court also appointed Marilyn Adams as State Lead Plaintiff, and Schiffrin Barroway Topaz & Kessler LTD (now known as Barroway Topaz Kessler Meltzer & Check LLP) as lead counsel in the State Action. At the same time, the State Action was stayed pending resolution of the Federal Action and remains stayed. The Federal Action and the State Action are referred to collectively in this Stipulation as the "Actions."
The Federal Action alleges claims on behalf of F5 against certain current and former officers and directors of F5, arising from or relating to the granting of stock options at F5, beginning as early as 1999. On October 25, 2006, F5 announced that a special committee had concluded after an internal investigation that the recorded grant dates for certain stock option grants made between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes. F5 further disclosed that the Company would likely need to restate its historical financial statements for fiscal 1999-2005 "to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense" related to past stock option grants," and that the [C]ompany's financial statements and earnings releases and similar financial communications relating to fiscal periods commencing on or after October 1, 1998, which is the first day of the [C]ompany's fiscal year 1999, and through the date of this release should no longer be relied upon." On November 8, 2006, F5 announced, among other things, that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2005 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22.9 million.
On November 26, 2006, Federal Lead Plaintiff filed its Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Consolidated Complaint"). The Consolidated Complaint asserted claims relating to the alleged backdating of stock option grant awards and the issuance of allegedly false and misleading statements and other SEC reports allegedly designed to conceal such backdating from shareholders against certain of the Defendants.
On February 28, 2007, F5 moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint on the theory that a pre-suit demand on the F5 Board of Directors would not have been futile. More specifically, F5
 
argued that the Consolidated Complaint contained no allegations that F5's directors lacked independence or that they were sufficiently "interested" in the events at issue to disqualify them from exercising their business judgment.
Federal Lead Plaintiff opposed F5's motion, arguing that the Consolidated Complaint sufficiently alleged the reasons demand on the F5 Board would have been futile. On August 6, 2007, the Court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. On September 14, 2007, Federal Lead Plaintiff filed its Amended Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleged violations of the federal securities laws, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and state common law. F5 filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on November 16, 2007, again arguing that Federal Lead Plaintiff had not adequately alleged that demand on the F5 Board would have been futile, and Federal Lead Plaintiff filed an opposition on January 18, 2008. F5 filed its reply on February 19, 2008. On July 3, 2008, the Court certified two questions concerning Washington State law to the Washington Supreme Court. Following full briefing and oral argument by the parties, on May 21, 2009, the Washington Supreme Court issued its opinion on the certified questions. In October 2009, the Court requested supplemental briefing to address the impact of the Washington Supreme Court's opinion on F5's pending motion to dismiss. Following submission of such briefing, the parties agreed to attempt a mediation of the Action, and sought and were granted a suspension of the ruling on F5's motion to dismiss until after the mediation.
In June 2010, the parties to the Federal Action attended a mediation before former United States District Judge Layn Phillips (Ret.). Since the mediation, Federal Lead Counsel and counsel for F5 and the Defendants have continued settlement negotiations to resolve the Federal Action, and reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Actions.
As a result of the Federal Action and settlement, reflected in this Stipulation (the "Settlement"), F5 has instituted, or will institute, significant corporate governance reforms designed to enhance its internal controls and operations. Federal Lead Plaintiff, Federal Lead Counsel and F5 believe that a settlement at this juncture on the terms and on the conditions set forth herein is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of F5.
 
 
On September 9, 2010, the Board of Directors of F5, in an exercise of its independent business judgment, approved the Settlement and each of its terms as fair, just and adequate, and in the best interest of F5 and its shareholders.
 
The principal terms, conditions and other matters that are part of the Settlement, which is subject to approval by the Court, are summarized below. This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Stipulation, which has been filed with the Court and is available at www.f5.com.
In connection with and conditioned upon the settlement of the Actions, F5 has agreed to implement and/or maintain the Corporate Governance Measures set forth below, which shall be maintained for a minimum of five years from the Effective Date.
 
 
The Board shall adopt an equity-based compensation award policy that applies to all current and future equity incentive plans, whether or not subject to shareholder approval, providing for the following:
(i) The policy shall clearly define the exercise price, the grant date, and the fair market value of stock (, the closing price of the stock on a specified date, or the average closing price over a specified period). In no event will the exercise price or value of an award be determined by reference to the fair market value of F5 stock on a date other than the grant date of the award. The fair market value of F5 stock on a grant date will be defined as the closing price for a share of F5 common stock on such date as reported on the NASDAQ.
e.g.
(ii) The following clause will be included in the policy: "The date of grant of an equity award must, for all purposes, be no earlier than the date on which the Board or
 
Compensation Committee makes the determination granting such award. Notice of the determination will be given to each employee or consultant to whom an equity award is so granted reasonably promptly following the grant date or by such date as may be required by applicable accounting standards. In no event will notice be given more than twenty (20) days after the date of such grant."
(iii) The policy shall require compliance with legal, professional, and ethical requirements for proper disclosure and proper accounting.
(iv) The policy shall require appropriate documentation for proper disclosure and accounting.
(v) The policy shall identify who is responsible and appropriate steps for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations by option grantees (, timely and accurate filing of SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5), and shall require effective monitoring mechanisms to ensure that such laws, and the plans, are followed.
e.g.
(vi) The Company shall maintain all records relating to all equity awards until at least seven (7) years after the expiration of the pertinent equity awards.
 
(i) Authority to grant stock option awards to directors and executive officers, and authority to approve parameters for stock option awards for other employees, shall be limited to the full Board or a properly constituted Compensation Committee, consisting of solely independent directors.
(ii) Grants to directors and any employee subject to 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Covered Employees within the meaning of 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall either be approved or be ratified by the full Board or the Compensation Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, as defined herein.
(iii) The Board or the Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall approve equity awards to newly hired employees and service providers (other than non-employee
 
directors) and to newly promoted individuals, to be granted on a quarterly basis effective February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 (or, if such day is not a business day, on the following business day) (the "New Hire Grant Date"). All such approvals shall occur on or prior to the New Hire Grant Date. The Board or the Compensation Committee, as applicable, at its discretion may also change in advance the annual grant dates and quarterly grant date for a given quarter, and shall disclose such change prior to the new annual grant date.
(iv) For equity awards that require approval at times other than regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings (for example, in connection with the hiring of a senior executive or the closing of an acquisition or other strategic transaction), the Compensation Committee may approve equity grants by calling a special Compensation Committee meeting. The grant date for each such equity grant shall be no earlier than the date that the Compensation Committee holds the special meeting and concurrently approves the grant. When a special Compensation Committee meeting is not feasible, the Compensation Committee may approve equity grants by having the entire Compensation Committee approve such grants by written consent. The grant date for all such grants approved by written consent shall be no earlier than the date on which the written consent is complete and approved in writing (or by electronic transmission) by all Compensation Committee members. All written consents shall carry the date of when each signatory signed (or electronically approved) the consent.
(v) The exercise price for any equity grants approved at times other than regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings shall be determined using the formula prescribed in the equity-based Compensation award policy described in I.A. herein. The Compensation Committee will promptly inform the Board about any equity grants to executive officers approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
 
 
(i) The Board's Committees shall have standing authorizations, at their discretion, to obtain legal or other advisors of their choice, who will report directly to the Board or the Committee.
(ii) A nominee for director shall be elected by a vote of a majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee's election.
 
(i) In the event that, and for as long as, the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person, the independent members of the Board shall annually elect an independent director to act in a lead capacity to coordinate the other independent directors, as described further below (the "Lead Independent Director"). The Lead Independent Director shall coordinate and moderate executive sessions of the Board's independent directors, and shall act as principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
(ii) In addition to the duties applicable to all Board members (which will not be limited or diminished by the Lead Independent Director's role), the Lead Independent Director shall be responsible for the following functions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At least a majority of the members of the Board shall be "independent directors," as defined below. To be deemed "independent" in any calendar year, a director, and the directors immediate family members, would have to satisfy the following qualifications:
(i) Has not been employed as an elected officer of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates within the last three (3) calendar years.
(ii) Has not received, during the current calendar year or any of the three immediately preceding calendar years, remuneration, directly or indirectly, other than de minimus remuneration (, not to exceed $100,000 per year), as a result of service as, or compensation paid to an entity affiliated with the director that serves as (i) an advisor, consultant, or legal counsel to the Company or to a member of the Company's senior management; or (ii) a significant customer or supplier (as defined by the NASDAQ rules) of the Company.
i.e.
 
 
(iii) Has no personal services contract(s) with the Company or any member of the Company's senior management.
(iv) Is not an executive officer of a public company at which an executive officer of the Company serves as a director.
(v) Is not a full-time employee or director of a non-profit entity that receives significant (, not to exceed $100,000 per year) contributions from the Company.
i.e.
(vi) Is not a member of the immediate family of any person described in subsections (i)-(iv) above.
(vii) Has not had any of the relationships described in subsections (a)-(f) above with any affiliate of the Company.
If the Company is out of compliance with the independence requirements set forth herein, the Company will return to compliance within 30 days.
 
Aside from meeting-related expenses such as airfare, hotel accommodations and modest travel/accident insurance, non-employee directors will receive no other perquisites. Health, life, and other forms of insurance, financial planning, automobile allowances, and other similar perquisites will not be provided as benefits to directors.
 
(i) Absent extraordinary circumstances, each member of the Board shall be required to attend each annual shareholder meeting in person.
(ii) All qualified shareholder proposals shall be evaluated by the Company's General Counsel and a Committee of at least two independent directors, as defined herein, chaired by an independent Chairman. Such Committee will determine, in consultation with the Company's General Counsel and with the assistance of outside advisors, if necessary, whether
 
the shareholder proposal complies with the applicable substantive and procedural requirements of the federal securities rules, and if so, will make a recommendation to the Board for or against such shareholder proposal including the reasons for such recommendation. The Committee will determine whether to publish this recommendation in the applicable proxy statement. Also, the Committee will determine, in consultation with the Company's General Counsel and with the assistance of outside advisors, if necessary, whether to submit a no-action request to the Securities And Exchange Commission.
 
(a) At least once every two (2) years the Compensation Committee shall select and retain an independent consultant to compare the Company's executive compensation policies, practices, and procedures relative to other public companies and prepare and submit to the Compensation Committee a report.
(b) The Company shall adopt a policy that if the Company restates its reported financial results to correct a material accounting error on an interim or annual financial statement included in a report on Form 10-Q or 10-K due to material noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, the Board of Directors shall review any performance-based bonuses paid to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and General Counsel as a result of the restated results during the 12-month period preceding the filing of the restatement and, to the extent practicable and in the best interests of shareholders, shall seek to recover or cancel the appropriate excess portion, if any, of such awards that were based on financial results that were revised in the restatement. Following such review, if the Board of Directors decides not to recover or cancel any portion of the awards at issue, that decision shall be disclosed in the Company's next annual proxy statement.
The Stipulation provides for the entry of judgment dismissing the Federal Action against the Defendants with prejudice and, as explained in more detail in the Stipulation, barring and releasing certain known or unknown claims that have been brought in the Actions or that could have been
 
brought in any court by F5 or any of its shareholders against F5 or the Defendants relating to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Federal Action. The Stipulation further provides that the entry of judgment will bar and release any known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought in any court by the Defendants against Federal Lead Plaintiff or plaintiffs' counsel related to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Actions or based upon or arising out of the institution, prosecution, assertion, settlement, or resolution of the Federal Action. In addition, after the Court approves the Settlement, Federal Lead Plaintiff and F5 will promptly seek dismissal with prejudice of the State Action; effectiveness of the Settlement is conditioned on dismissal of the State Action.
 
After negotiating the Corporate Governance Reforms in the Settlement, Federal Lead Counsel and F5, with the assistance of the mediator, former United States District Court Judge Layn R. Phillips (Ret.), negotiated the attorneys' fees and expenses that F5 would pay to plaintiffs' counsel, subject to Court approval. As a result of these negotiations, and in light of the substantial benefit conferred, F5 agreed that plaintiffs' counsel be paid $5,000,000.00 in cash for their fees and expenses (the "Fee Award"). The Fee Award includes fees and expenses incurred by plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the prosecution and settlement of the Actions. To date, plaintiffs' counsel have not received any payments for their efforts on behalf of F5 shareholders. The Fee Award will compensate plaintiffs' counsel for the results achieved in the Actions.
 
Counsel for the Settling Parties believe that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Plaintiffs, F5 and its shareholders.
 
Federal Lead Plaintiff and its counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Actions have merit. However, Federal Lead Plaintiff and its counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and
 
length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Federal Action against the Defendants through trial and appeal. Federal Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Actions, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Federal Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also are mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the violations asserted in the Actions. Based on Federal Lead Plaintiff's and its counsel's understanding of the facts, the settlement provides an excellent recovery based on the alleged conduct of the Defendants. Based on their evaluation, Federal Lead Plaintiff and its counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of F5 and its shareholders.
 
The Defendants have denied, and continue to deny each and every one of the claims, contentions and allegations of liability made against them or that could have been made against them in the Actions, and expressly deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them. The Defendants assert that they have meritorious defenses to those claims and that judgment should be entered dismissing all claims against them with prejudice. The Defendants have thus entered into the Stipulation to avoid the continuing additional expense, inconvenience, and distraction of this litigation and to avoid the risks inherent in any lawsuit, and without admitting any wrongdoing or liability whatsoever.
 
On , 2010, at .m., the Court will hold the Settlement Hearing at the United States Courthouse, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, 700 Stewart Street, Seattle, Washington. At the Settlement Hearing, the Court will consider whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and thus should be finally approved, whether the Fee Award should be approved, and whether the Federal Action should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 19, 2011, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2010. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $268.9 million, up 5.8 percent from $254.3 million in the prior quarter and 40.7 percent from $191.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 19, 2011
GAAP net income was $55.7 million ($0.68 per diluted share), compared to $48.2 million ($0.59 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $29.3 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $72.2 million ($0.88 per diluted share), compared to $63.9 million ($0.79 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $41.4 million ($0.52 per diluted share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP results reflect reinstatement of the R&D tax credit passed by Congress in December. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Coming off a very strong fourth quarter, the company achieved solid revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2011," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Product revenue was up nearly 44 percent from the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and service revenue grew more than 35 percent during the same period. On a regional basis, all geographies delivered sequential and year-over-year gains, led by Asia Pacific where revenue was up 11 percent from the prior quarter and 62 percent from the first quarter a year ago. Underpinning the continued strength in our service business, deferred revenue grew 10.9 percent to $287.8 million from the previous quarter.
"Solid revenue growth, stable gross margins and disciplined execution enabled us to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of just over 38 percent. Consistent with our policy of hiring behind
 
revenue, we added 120 new employees, approximately half of them in sales and sales support," McAdam said.
During the first quarter F5 generated $103 million in cash from operations, and after repurchasing 197,644 shares of its outstanding common stock, the company ended the quarter with $952 million in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending March 31, management has set a revenue goal of $275 million to $280 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products
 
and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 Compensation  Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the
 
company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

SEATTLE, WAApril 20, 2011
GAAP net income was $55.6 million ($0.68 per diluted share), compared to $55.7 million ($0.68 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $33.1 million ($0.41 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $71.5 million ($0.88 per diluted share), compared to $72.2 million ($0.88 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $45.2 million ($0.56 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
"F5's solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by continuing strength in the Americas and APAC," said John McAdam, president and chief executive officer. Revenue from the Americas grew 4 percent from the prior quarter and 38 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. APAC revenue increased 10 percent from the prior quarter and 68 percent year-over-year. Japan revenue was down 6 percent sequentially and flat with revenue in the second quarter of last year.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $290.7 million, up 4.7 percent from $277.6 million in the prior quarter and 26.1 percent from $230.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 20, 2011
GAAP net income was $62.5 million ($0.77 per diluted share), compared to $55.6 million ($0.68 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $40.5 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $79.4 million ($0.97 per diluted share), compared to $71.5 million ($0.88 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $53.3 million ($0.66 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Strong sales in APAC and Japan, in particular of our high-end products, accounted for most of the revenue growth during the quarter," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "EMEA revenue was down from the prior quarter, and Americas revenue was up only slightly, due in part to a slowdown in U.S. Federal sales.
"In June we began shipping VIPRION 2400, our new chassis-based application delivery controller that offers scalable performance and other advanced features of the VIPRION architecture at a price in the mid-range of our ADC product family. Both enterprise customers and service providers have expressed growing interest in this product, and we expect sales to ramp steadily over the next several quarters. This quarter, we are on track to release version 11.0 of our TMOS operating system, which includes user-friendly application templates, support for virtual clustered multi-processing, and more than 150 new features, many of them geared toward service providers.
 
"With the rollout of these new products and a number of others over the coming year, we continue to believe that our competitive position in the traditional ADC market has never been stronger, and that the opportunity to expand our footprint in adjacent markets has never been greater. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to sustain top-line growth and profitability by continuing to expand our reach into new and existing markets and by hiring and retaining the best people.
"During the third quarter we added 95 employees, roughly a third of them in sales and sales support. At the same time, productivity across the organization enabled us to achieve a non-GAAP operating profit margin of 38.2 percent," McAdam said.
The company also continued to strengthen its financial position during the quarter, generating $101 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 471,633 shares of our outstanding common stock F5 ended the quarter with $1.06 billion in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending September 30, management has set a revenue goal of $307 million to $312 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.75 to $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.97 to $0.99 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and
 
general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 Compensation  Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2011 ("Original Filing"). The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Company's decision on how frequently it will conduct future shareholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers. This Form 8-K/A does not otherwise revise the Original Filing in any way.
The Board has considered the appropriate frequency of future non-binding advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers.

The Board has decided that future non-binding advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers will be submitted to shareholders of the Company on an annual basis.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
SEATTLE, WAOctober 25, 2011F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $314.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, up 8 percent from $290.7 million in the prior quarter and 24 percent from $254.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. For fiscal year 2011, revenue was $1.15 billion, up 31 percent from $882.0 million in fiscal year 2010.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $67.6 million ($0.84 per diluted share) compared to $62.5 million ($0.77 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2011 and $48.2 million ($0.59 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP net income for the year was $241.4 million ($2.96 per diluted share) versus $151.2 million ($1.86 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2010.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $85.2 million ($1.06 per diluted share), compared to $79.4 million ($0.97 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $63.9 million ($0.79 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal year 2011, non-GAAP net income was $308.3 million ($3.78 per diluted share) versus $203.8 million ($2.51 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2010.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's fourth quarter results reflect solid year-over-year gains across all regions and vertical market segments. In addition, product sales strengthened during the quarter, driving product revenue up 10 percent sequentially and 20 percent year-over-year.
"In the first full quarter that VIPRION 2400 was generally available, demand for the new mid-range chassis exceeded our expectations. During the fourth quarter, we also saw strong demand for VIPRION 4400, our high-end chassis, particularly among our Telco customers.
 
"Since we announced the availability of TMOS v.11 early in the quarter, customer response has been very positive. As more customers begin to roll out TMOS v.11 across their organizations, we expect to see strengthening demand for our VIPRION products, which are designed to support the full range of features and functions available in the new software. Several VIPRION customers are starting to deploy vCMP, a feature of TMOS v.11 that allows them to run multiple instances of BIG-IP on the same platform. During calendar 2012 we plan to release several new BIG-IP platforms designed to support vCMP and the other advanced capabilities of TMOS v.11," McAdam said.
Reflecting slightly higher software attach rates and strong product and service revenue, gross margin ticked up during the quarter. GAAP operating margin increased to 31.6 percent and non-GAAP operating margin rose to 38.6 percent. In the fourth quarter, the company added 140 employees, increasing total headcount to 2,490.
On the company's balance sheet, deferred revenue grew 7 percent sequentially to $343.3 million, up 32 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Cash flow from operations was $121.5 million in the fourth quarter and $417 million for the year. After repurchasing $150 million of F5 common stock during the quarter, the company ended the year with $1.01 billion in cash and investments.
"The fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was a strong finish to the year," McAdam said. "As we begin a new fiscal year, we anticipate that the seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of last year will be a recurring factor in our first quarter results going forward.
"With that in mind, our revenue target for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, ending December 31, is $315 million to $320 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.79 to $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.99 to $1.01 per diluted share. For fiscal 2012, we expect sequential revenue growth throughout the year and solid year-over-year growth."
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:
 
 
Share Repurchase Program
The company also announced today that its board of directors had authorized an additional $200 million for the company's common stock share repurchase program. This new authorization is incremental to the $166 million currently in the existing program which was initially authorized in October 2010.
Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating
 
results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
The reconciliation of the company's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings for the three months and twelve months ended September 30, 2010 also excludes a legal settlement charge.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

 For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $322.4 million, up 2.5 percent from $314.6 million in the prior quarter and 19.9 percent from $268.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 18, 2012
GAAP net income was $66.5 million ($0.83 per diluted share), compared to $67.6 million ($0.84 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $55.7 million ($0.68 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation net of tax, non-GAAP net income was $82.2 million ($1.03 per diluted share), compared to $85.2 million ($1.06 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $72.2 million ($0.88 per diluted share) in the first quarter of last year.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Strong sales in APAC, Japan, and particularly North America offset the seasonal slowdown that typically characterizes the first quarter of a new fiscal year. We were also pleased that sales in the EMEA region exceeded our expectations," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer.
"Strength in product sales was driven in part by growing demand for VIPRION 2400, our recently introduced midrange chassis product, across all regions and vertical markets. As a result, sales of all VIPRION products nearly tripled compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
"In addition, sales of our vCMP (Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing) module, which enables customers to run multiple virtual BIG-IPs on a single VIPRION, were very strong during the quarter. Increasing attach rates for Application Security Manager, Access Policy Manager and other BIG-IP software modules also boosted sales, and demand for BIG-IP virtual editions continued to outpace our expectations."
F5 achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.8 percent, while adding 125 employees during the quarter. The company also continued to strengthen its financial position during the quarter, generating $132 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 320,100 shares of its outstanding common stock the company ended the quarter with $1.11 billion in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending March 31, management has set a revenue goal of $332 million to $337 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.05 to $1.07 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding,
as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718").
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.

On April 18, 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2012. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
(d) Exhibits:
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $339.6 million, up 5.3 percent from $322.4 million in the prior quarter and 22.4 percent from $277.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
SEATTLE, WAApril 18, 2012
GAAP net income was $68.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share), compared to $66.5 million ($0.83 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $55.6 million ($0.68 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges and related tax effects, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $87.1 million ($1.09 per diluted share), compared to $82.2 million ($1.03 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $71.5 million ($0.88 per diluted share) in the second quarter of last year.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said strong demand for VIPRION platforms, F5's industry leading Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing technology ("vCMP"), and the full range of BIG-IP software modules contributed to solid gains in product revenue, which grew more than 18 percent year over year. Bookings growth was solid in APAC, especially in Japan, and sales growth in EMEA was in line with overall growth during the quarter. Solid growth in the Americas was driven by strong service provider sales.
"During the quarter we continued to see growing demand for both VIPRION 2400, our midrange chassis-based application delivery controller, and VIPRION 4400, the high end of our ADC product family," McAdam said. "In early April, we introduced a new chassis, VIPRION 4480, with new blades that effectively double the performance of VIPRION 4400."
"VIPRION 4480 is the highest performing ADC on the market. Like all of our VIPRION and BIG-IP products it is also an ICSAcertified network firewall, delivering twelve times the performance of the nearest competing product. In the second quarter we saw increasing demand for all of our security products, including our security modules, Application Security Manager (ASM) and Access Policy Manager (APM), and our EDGE Gateway appliance. As the number and complexity of security threats continues to grow, we anticipate that our integrated security solutions will be an increasingly important component of our revenue stream."
During the quarter, F5 added approximately 190 employees worldwide, including 60 from Traffix Systems. Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems on February 22, 2012 and the repurchase of 404,106 shares of its outstanding common stock, the company ended the quarter with $1.03 billion in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending June 30, management has set a revenue goal of $350 million to $355 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets and related tax effects, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions.

On July 18, 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2012. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $352.6 million, up 3.8 percent from $339.6 million in the prior quarter and 21.3 percent from $290.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 18, 2012
GAAP net income was $72.3 million ($0.91 per diluted share), compared to $68.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $62.5 million ($0.77 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges and related tax effects, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $90.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share), compared to $87.1 million ($1.09 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $79.4 million ($0.97 per diluted share) in the third quarter of last year.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"During the third quarter, F5's revenue and earnings continued to grow sequentially and year over year despite a more cautious spending environment," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Overall, revenue growth slowed in Q3, but revenue by region was generally consistent with historical patterns; 57 percent for the Americas (primarily the United States) and 43 percent for EMEA and APJ, with EMEA contributing 21 percent of the total.
"As in the prior quarter, our security offerings were a key driver of product sales and accounted for a growing percentage of total revenue. In addition, we saw continued strong uptake of VIPRION 2400 along with increasing adoption of TMOS version 11.
"During the next six to nine months we are on track to deliver several new products, including a refresh of our BIG-IP appliance family, new policy enforcement capability for service providers and an eight-blade VIPRION chassis.
 
"Meanwhile, we are continuing to strengthen our organization and our financial position. In the third quarter, we added 100 employees, increased deferred revenue to $434 million and generated $113 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 425,088 shares of our outstanding common stock we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments."
In light of the cautious spending environment in the current global economy, McAdam said management has set a revenue goal of $360 million to $370 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, ending September 30. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges and related tax effects, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company's operational performance and financial results.
For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 24, 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2012. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
SEATTLE, WAOctober 24, 2012F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $362.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, up 3 percent from $352.6 million in the prior quarter and 15 percent from $314.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. For fiscal year 2012, revenue was $1.38 billion, up 20 percent from $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2011.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $67.7 million ($0.85 per diluted share) compared to $72.3 million ($0.91 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2012 and $67.6 million ($0.84 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP net income for the year was $275.2 million ($3.45 per diluted share) versus $241.4 million ($2.96 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2011.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88.7 million ($1.12 per diluted share), compared to $90.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $85.2 million ($1.06 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For fiscal year 2012, non-GAAP net income was $348.6 million ($4.37 per diluted share) versus $308.3 million ($3.78 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2011.
The company's GAAP and non-GAAP net income reflect higher than expected effective tax rates for fiscal year 2012. This resulted from a higher than expected impact of foreign permanent tax differences and a higher blended effective state tax rate which resulted in a GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 39.9 percent. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.0 percent.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"F5 grew sequentially and year over year throughout fiscal 2012," said F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam. "But after a strong first half, revenue growth slowed in the second half of the year. Beginning in the third quarter and continuing through Q4, slowing growth in product revenue reflected smaller deal sizes, particularly among large U.S. enterprise and telecommunications customers. Annual U.S. revenue grew just over 16 percent from fiscal 2011. By contrast, international revenue grew nearly 24 percent in fiscal 2012, resulting in overall revenue growth of 20 percent for the year.
 
"We maintained strong product gross margins for the quarter and the year at 83 percent and as a result, we were able to add 540 employees in fiscal 2012, including 125 in Q4, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin of 39 percent," said McAdam.
During the fourth quarter, the company increased deferred revenue by $13.4 million to $447.3 million, up 30 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Cash flow from operations was $149 million in the fourth quarter and $495 million for the year. After repurchasing approximately 1.7 million shares of F5 common stock during fiscal 2012, the company ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
"As we enter fiscal 2013, it is difficult to predict what turns the economy will take. But as we look out over the year, we believe that changes in the evolving technology landscape are creating new opportunities for growth and that our technology roadmap and product deliverables will enable us to capitalize on those changes. On October 16, 2012 we introduced BIG-IP 4200v, the first in a series of new appliances that will replace our entry-level and mid-range BIG-IP platforms and extend our market leadership in price/performance and functionality. In addition to these new platforms, we will be introducing significant performance and functionality enhancements to TMOS and new software modules that will expand the array of integrated application delivery functions currently available on our platforms and in virtual editions. We will also expand and upgrade our VIPRION family of chassis products over the next several quarters.
"While we are excited about these new products and their potential to drive revenue growth, current macroeconomic conditions and our expectation of normal Q1 seasonality have tempered our outlook for the near term," said McAdam.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, ending December 31, the company has set a revenue target of $363 million to $370 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.86 to $0.88 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.14 to $1.16 per diluted share.
 
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
Use of non-GAAP Financial Information
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial
 
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions.
Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company's operational performance and financial results.
For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 23, 2013, F5 Networks, Inc. issued a press release regarding its financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2012. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $365.5 million, up 1 percent from $362.6 million in the prior quarter and 13 percent from $322.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 23, 2013
GAAP net income was $69.5 million ($0.88 per diluted share), compared to $67.7 million ($0.85 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $66.5 million ($0.83 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net income was $90.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share), compared to $88.7 million ($1.12 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $82.2 million ($1.03 per diluted share) in the first quarter of last year.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"During the first quarter, strong sales to North American enterprises and service providers were offset by a substantial slowdown in U.S. Federal sales," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Japan sales were also weak during the quarter, in contrast to continuing strength in Europe and solid year-over-year growth in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.
"A key driver of product revenue in the quarter was strong demand for BIG-IP 4200v, the first in our series of new ADC appliances, which we introduced in mid-October. Recently, we began shipping our new entry-level appliances, the 2000 series, which will be announced during the next few weeks along with our new high-end appliance, BIG-IP 10200, and our 8-blade VIPRION 4800 chassis.
"During the quarter, sales of our software modules and virtual edition (VE) products continued to gain traction. Very shortly, we will be announcing general availability of our Advanced
Firewall Manager (AFM), as well as enhanced versions of Application Security Manager (ASM) and Access Policy Manager (APM), key components of our Application Delivery Firewall solution. In addition we will be launching new high-performance versions of all our BIG-IP VE products.
"As these and other new products enter the market over the next two quarters, we believe they will have a positive impact on our product revenue and continue to expand our addressable market," McAdam said.

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release concerning the continuing strength of F5's business, sequential growth, the target revenue and earnings range, share amount and share price assumptions, demand for application delivery networking and storage virtualization products and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.
GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation,
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions.
Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company's operational performance and financial results.
For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."

(a) 200,000,000 shares of common stock ("Common Stock").
(b) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock ("Preferred Stock"). Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote. On dissolution of the Corporation, after any preferential amount with respect to the Preferred Stock has been paid or set aside, the holders of Common Stock and the holders of any series of Preferred Stock entitled to participate further in the distribution of assets are entitled to receive the net assets of the Corporation.
2.2 The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "Act") and by the provisions of this Article II, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series and to determine the designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations of the shares of each series. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series includes determination of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within any limits stated in these Articles or in the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing a series, the Board of Directors, after the issuance of shares of a series, may amend the resolution establishing the series to decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of that series, and the number of shares constituting the decrease shall thereafter constitute authorized but undesignated shares, and the Board of Directors may amend the rights and preferences of the shares of any series that has been established but is wholly unissued.
The authority herein granted to the Board of Directors to determine the relative rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock shall be limited to unissued shares, and no power shall exist to alter or change the rights and preferences of any shares that have been issued.
2.3 The Board of Directors shall have the authority to issue shares of the capital stock of this Corporation and the certificates therefor subject to such transfer restrictions and other limitations as it may deem necessary to promote compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, and to regulate the transfer thereof in such manner as may be calculated to promote such compliance or to further any other reasonable purpose.

(b) any director elected prior to the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2014 whose term does not expire at such annual meeting of shareholders held in 2014 shall hold office for the remainder of the term for which such director was elected and until such director's successor is duly elected and qualified or until such director's death, resignation or removal.
Neither the Board of Directors nor any individual director may be removed without cause. Subject to any limitation imposed by law, any individual director or directors may be removed with cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
3.3 In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors shall have the power to make, adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws, or adopt new Bylaws for this Corporation, by a resolution adopted by a majority of the directors.
3.4 Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors. Any director appointed or elected to fill a vacancy in the board of directors (a) resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a prior director shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor and (b) resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders, in each case subject to the election and qualification of a successor and to such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

No cumulative voting for directors shall be permitted.
4.3 The approval of any plan of merger, plan of share exchange, sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the Corporation's property otherwise than in the usual and regular course of business, or proposal to dissolve, shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the corporation. At any time when the corporation is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the authority granted under RCW 23B.10.030, RCW 23B.11.030, RCW 23B.12.020, and RCW 23B.14.020, the vote of shareholders of this Corporation required in order to approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, a plan of merger or share exchange, the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property of the Corporation not in the usual and regular course of business, or dissolution of the Corporation shall be a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group, regardless of whether or not the corporation is a "public company," as that term is defined in Section 23B.01.400 of the Act.
5.1 The Corporation may indemnify, in the manner and to the full extent permitted by law, any person (or the estate of any person) who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or complete action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the
Corporation, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The Corporation may, to the full extent permitted by law, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such person against any liability which may be asserted against such person. To the full extent permitted by law, the indemnification provided herein shall include expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, and, in the manner provided by law, any such expenses may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. The indemnification provided herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to indemnify any other person for any such expenses to the full extent permitted by law, nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification from the corporation may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
5.2 No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for his conduct as a director, except for (i) acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law by the director, (ii) approval of distributions or loans in violation of RCW 23B.08.310, or (iii) any transaction from which the director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to which the director is not legally entitled. If the Act is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Act, as so amended. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
6.1 Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, as amended from time to time, the corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provisions contained in these Articles in any manner now or hereafter prescribed or permitted by statute.
6.2 The corporation shall have authority to correct clerical errors in any documents filed with the Secretary of State of Washington, including these Articles or any amendments hereto, without the necessity of special shareholder approval of such corrections.

F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, ended March 31. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be $350.2 million, below the company's guidance of $370 million to $380 million. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.79 to $0.80 per diluted share, compared to guidance of $0.93 to $0.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.06 to $1.07 per diluted share, compared to guidance of $1.21 to $1.24 per diluted share.
SEATTLE, WAApril 4, 2013
John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer, said the revenue shortfall resulted primarily from a slowdown in North American and to a lesser extent EMEA sales, while sales in Japan and Asia-Pacific were essentially in line with the company's expectations.
"From a market perspective, Telco bookings were down sharply on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. U.S. Federal sales were also down significantly from the second quarter a year ago.
"Currently, we are looking into all the factors affecting the quarter's results and we plan to provide more color during our regularly scheduled release and conference call on April 24," McAdam said.
 
A reconciliation of the company's anticipated GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

SEATTLE, April 24, 2013 - F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $350.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, down four percent from $365.5 million in the prior quarter and up three percent from $339.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
GAAP net income for the second quarter was $63.4 million ($0.80 per diluted share) compared to $69.5 million ($0.88 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2013 and $68.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share) in the second quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $84.7 million ($1.07 per diluted share), compared to $90.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $87.1 million ($1.09 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"As we indicated in our announcement of preliminary results on April 4, service provider revenues for the second quarter came in significantly below our expectations," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "We believe this was primarily due to project delays, which caused customers to postpone orders that we had expected to close during the quarter. The weakness in sales to service providers was especially pronounced in North America. In addition, sales to the Federal government were also below our internal forecast as a consequence of continuing uncertainty over the impact of sequestration and other efforts to reduce Federal spending.
"Among enterprise customers, business remained relatively strong, fueled by growing demand for our security offerings, including our new Advanced Firewall Manager, and our refreshed line of BIG-IP platforms. During the quarter, sales of BIG-IP 4200v, introduced in October, continued to ramp in line with our expectations, and BIG-IP 4000 series platforms accounted for nearly a quarter of the
 
platforms we sold to replace Cisco ACE products. Sales of BIG-IP 2000, our new entry-level platform introduced in January, were also in line with our expectations. We believe this bodes well for the successful launch of additional new products, including the BIG-IP 5000 and BIG-IP 7000 series, during the second half of the fiscal year," McAdam said.
In spite of continuing weakness in the global economy, McAdam said he believes the growing pipeline for the company's new products and strong demand for its security solutions will have a positive impact on product sales throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2013. For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, ending June 30, the company has set a revenue target of $355 million to $365 million and a GAAP earnings target of $0.80 to $0.83 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.06 to $1.09 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time.

GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization
 
of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions.
Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company's operational performance and financial results.
For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."
