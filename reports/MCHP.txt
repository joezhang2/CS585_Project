ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On July 17, 2002, we signed an agreement to acquire a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon from Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc., referred to as FMI, for $183.5 million in cash. The assets we would acquire upon closing include a 196-acre campus, buildings totaling approximately 826,500 square feet (including approximately 200,000 square feet of clean room space) and manufacturing equipment. We intend to use the facility to manufacture semiconductors. FMI manufactured semiconductors at the facility. We negotiated the purchase price at arm's length and there is no material relationship between FMI and us or any of our affiliates, or our officers or directors or the associates of any such officer or director. We will pay the purchase price from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Closing of the transaction is subject to several closing conditions, including the qualification of the facility under the state of Oregon's Strategic Investment Program, a program that would provide a partial tax exemption for the facility for a limited period of time. Closing of the transaction is scheduled to occur on October 31, 2002, however, FMI has the option to accelerate closing to the end of August 2002, upon completion of all closing conditions. A copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report on Form 8-K ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

This Section does not require Seller to prepare any environmental studies or reports that Seller would not otherwise be obligated to prepare under this Agreement or under applicable Environmental Laws. Upon Closing, or upon termination of this Agreement prior to Closing, Page 13 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
Seller shall pay Purchaser the sum of Sixty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($60,000.00) as a contribution towards Purchaser's costs and expenses. Purchaser may elect to treat that Sixty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($60,000.00) as a credit against the Purchase Price at Closing. If either party terminates this Agreement and, following such termination, Seller pays to Purchaser the Sixty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($60,000.00), then Purchaser will provide Seller with copies of all reports prepared pursuant to this Section 6.01, and at that time will waive Purchaser's attorney-client privilege in connection with such reports. (c) In addition to the other provisions that expressly survive Closing, the provisions of this Section 6.01 shall survive Closing. 6.02 PURCHASER INDEMNITY. Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify and save Seller, its employees, officers, directors, representatives, invitees and agents harmless from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, losses, damages, suits, proceedings and other obligations (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) to the extent resulting from any negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct of Purchaser, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees, in connection with the investigation or other pre-Closing activities of Purchaser, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees on the Real Property. If any negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct involves parties other than Purchaser, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees, then Purchaser's labiality shall be limited to that portion of any damages or liability attributable solely to Purchaser's negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct. The foregoing indemnity obligation of Purchaser contained in this Section 6.02 shall survive the Closing or sooner termination of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter. 6.03 PERMIT TRANSFERS. Purchaser will be reviewing the Permits to determine whether and which of the Permits it wishes to have transferred to it. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Purchaser in Purchaser's attempts to have the Permits assigned to Purchaser (to the extent that Purchaser requests assignment under Section 1.02[b] or [c]), including, but not limited to, meeting with government and agency personnel, introducing Purchaser and its representatives to appropriate people, and joining applications for the transfers, and Purchaser shall not require that Seller hire third-party consultants or incur third-party expenses (beyond Seller's reasonable attorneys' fees) not normally incurred by Seller as part of its operation or maintenance of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility, as part of its duty to cooperate and assist under this Section 6.03. Purchaser shall submit all applications for Permit transfers to Seller prior to submission to the applicable Governmental Entity or third party. Purchaser shall pay the cost of all fees due to third parties in connection with such transfers. Nothing herein shall require Purchaser to pay any of Seller's legal fees in connection with Seller's duty to cooperate and assist under this Section 6.03. To the extent the Permits are assignable and Purchaser determines that it wants the assignment of a particular Permit, Seller shall assign the same to Purchaser at Closing in the Bill of Sale. If a particular Permit requires a special instrument of transfer, Seller shall reasonably cooperate Page 14 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
with Purchaser in securing and providing the same. Neither Purchaser shall modify nor shall Seller be required to modify, prior to the Closing Date, any Permit, and all Permit assignments shall be made contingent upon Closing. 6.04 SERVICE CONTRACTS COMPONENT OF PERMITS. As part of its due diligence review, Purchaser shall have the right to review all service, operation, warranty, maintenance or financing leases and/or contracts affecting the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility (and Seller shall provide or has provided, copies to Purchaser of all such contracts that are in effect, and in Seller's possession or control, as of the Effective Date and carry a contract price in excess of $10,000). To the extent that such leases and contracts are assignable as part of the Permits and Purchaser desires to receive an assignment thereof, such leases and contracts shall be assigned to Purchaser in the Bill of Sale. If a lease or contract requires a special instrument of transfer, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in securing and providing the same. To the extent not so assigned, Seller shall, subject to Sections 13.01(a) and 13.10 below, either terminate such leases and contracts at Closing at its expense or if prior notice of termination is required, give notice of termination at Closing and thereafter complete such termination at Seller's sole cost and expense. Purchaser shall assume Seller's post-Closing obligations as of the Closing Date under such leases and contracts that are assigned to Purchaser and Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from all pre-Closing obligations thereunder. The foregoing indemnity obligation of Seller contained in this Section 6.04 shall survive the Closing or sooner termination of this Agreement. 6.05 SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS. Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right to extract and delete the Fujitsu Proprietary Data from the equipment automation and manufacturing execution systems and other software applications. Purchaser acknowledges that the failure of Seller to remove any of the Fujitsu Proprietary Data prior to Closing and delivery of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility to Purchaser shall not affect Seller's right to have such data removed at any later time (but not beyond December 31, 2002), provided that such post-Closing removal shall only occur following ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Purchaser and then only under the supervision and control of Purchaser and subject to the provisions of the NDA. Any extraction may, at Purchaser's election, occur using only Purchaser's personnel. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.05 shall survive Closing. 6.06 HART-SCOTT-RODINO AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and reasonably cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-acquisition Page 15 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
notification forms required by the acquisition notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction as agreed to by the parties. Seller and Purchaser each shall (i) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings, and (ii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or acquisition control authorities of any other jurisdiction, and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; provided that neither party need supply to the other party or such Governmental Entities any information that the parties reasonably deem proprietary except as strictly necessary to comply with the HSR Act. (b) The parties agree to take all actions necessary to (i) avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iii) defend any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Government Entity vacated or reversed until such time as a non-appealable final order enjoining the transaction is entered. (c) It shall be a mutual condition of Closing that no Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is in effect and which has the effect of making the transaction illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transaction, and that all waiting periods, if any, under the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated hereby will have expired or terminated early and all foreign antitrust approvals reasonably determined by Seller or Purchaser to be required to be obtained prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained. (d) Purchaser shall pay the filing fee of the acquiror for the pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act, and Seller and Purchaser shall share equally (i) the aggregate filing fees for all international acquisition notifications, and (ii) the fees incurred by all jointly retained counsel to effectuate any foreign competition filings that the parties deem necessary, PROVIDED THAT the parties will make reasonable efforts to retain common counsel for any such foreign filings where appropriate. 6.07 WETLANDS. (a) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that the Real Property contains wetlands that may be eligible and appropriate for delineation by the Oregon Division of State Lands ("DSL") and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("COE") as waters of the State of Oregon and of the United States ("Jurisdictional Wetlands") and concurrence by the City of Gresham. Some portions of these potential Jurisdictional Wetlands were filled without permits and Seller will be negotiating resolution of those Clean Water Act issues with DSL and COE. Seller shall remain responsible for meeting all wetlands mitigation requirements and for all costs and liabilities associated with or arising from the past unpermitted filling of potential Jurisdictional Wetlands, as identified in the wetlands studies prepared for Seller by Fishman Environmental Services, dated January 2001 and June 2002. Page 16 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
(b) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that resolution of the unpermitted fills could, with the Purchaser's consent, require utilization of multiple acres of the Real Property for mitigation that meets standards and conditions of the COE and the DSL. Seller shall use its best efforts to resolve the matter without use of the Real Property. Seller shall use its best efforts to promptly obtain, from the DSL and the COE, approval of the sale to Purchaser of the filled potential Jurisdictional Wetlands and waiver of any current or future requirement to remove the past fill. If the COE and the DSL do not approve performing all required mitigation and restoration off-site, Purchaser shall provide Seller and the COE and the DSL personnel with reasonable access to the Real Property, as reasonably necessary for Seller's performance of such wetlands restoration or enhancement and monitoring. Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to on-site mitigation, which arises from DSL and COE negotiations so long as the on-site mitigation is on Parcel 2. Purchaser shall have sole discretion to approve or disapprove any on-site mitigation or restoration on Parcel 1 except if mandated by the COE or the DSL under proper legal process. Seller agrees that with respect to those areas on the Real Property for on-site mitigation, if any are approved by Purchaser and agreed to by the DSL and the COE Seller shall compensate Purchaser at the agreed rate of $5.00 per square foot for any land in Parcel 1 but shall not compensate Purchaser for any land in Parcel 2. This compensation shall not effect a purchase of the property or transfer of title to Seller. (c) Seller has, at its sole expense, engaged expert consultants to undertake and provide to Purchaser an inventory of all potential Jurisdictional Wetlands at the Real Property including a surveyor map of the delineated wetlands ("Wetlands Inventory") by July 17, 2002, or three weeks from the execution of the contract between Seller and the expert consultants, whichever is later, and that Wetlands Inventory is based on a scope of work reviewed and approved by Purchaser. The Wetlands Inventory shall include a survey of plant and animal species currently listed or a candidate for listing under the state of Oregon or Federal Endangered Species Acts, which survey may be presented as a separate report. The Wetlands Inventory shall, to the extent permitted by law, be prepared and managed, by both Seller and Purchaser, so as to protect and keep confidential and privileged the information contained in the Wetlands Inventory, until such time as Seller and Purchaser agree to make the Wetlands Inventory available to third parties. (d) During the First Contingency Period, Purchaser shall propose to Seller a wetlands mitigation protocol ("Wetlands Protocol"). Seller shall review and in good faith approve or negotiate the terms of the Wetlands Protocol with Purchaser until agreement on those terms is reached. To the extent an agreement on the Wetlands Protocol is not reached between the parties, then (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.07 shall still apply. The Wetlands Protocol shall include, but not be limited to the following: (i) The process that will be followed to keep the Wetlands Inventory confidential and privileged based on a Joint Defense Agreement to be proposed by Seller; (ii) The process that will be followed to allow for consultation and participation of Purchaser in Seller's negotiations with DSL and COE; and Page 17 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
(iii) Any other process and procedure matters which Seller and Purchaser mutually agree should be included in the Wetlands Protocol. 6.08 RIGHT TO TERMINATE. If: (a) during the First Contingency Period, Purchaser determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility (or any aspect thereof, including, but not limited to, future use and development potential thereof) is not suitable, appropriate or feasible for Purchaser's intended use; (b) during the First Contingency Period, Seller and Purchaser have not agreed upon a final Wetlands Protocol; (c) during the First Contingency Period (or within two [2] Business Days thereafter pursuant to Section 1.02[c], if applicable), Seller and Purchaser fail to reach agreement on modifications to the Asset Schedules, which will be exhibits to the Bill of Sale and the Transfer License Agreement; (d) during the First Contingency Period, Purchaser shall not have received evidence satisfactory to Purchaser that the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility will be taxed (for real and personal property tax purposes) for the July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003, real property tax year, based on a Real Market Value (as defined in Section 308.205 of the Oregon Revised Statutes) in an amount not more than the total Purchase Price, exclusive of any modifications or additions to the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility made by Purchaser; (e) during the SIP Contingency Period, Purchaser has not obtained the SIP for the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility on terms and subject to conditions acceptable to Purchaser in its sole and absolute discretion, (provided, however, that Purchaser agrees to share its draft SIP Agreement with Seller's legal counsel [which shall not be shared with Seller or any other person unless such drafts are public documents], provide periodic updates on the progress or lack thereof being made on the SIP and, if a decision is made by Purchaser prior to expiration of the SIP Contingency Period not to further pursue the SIP, then to promptly notify Seller of that decision); (f) prior to Closing, the conditions in Section 6.06(c) have not been met and satisfied; or (g) Purchaser terminates this Agreement on or before Closing pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 7.03(b), then Purchaser may, at any time, at or before 5:00 p.m. on the (i) last day of the First Contingency Period as to the matters in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) (or within two [2] Business Days thereafter pursuant to Section 1.02(c), if applicable), (ii) last day of the SIP Contingency Period as to the matter in clause (e), (iii) on the Closing Date as to the matter in clause (f), and (iv) Page 18 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
on the Closing Date, or if earlier, the last date for termination provided in Section 7.03, as to the matter in clause (g), terminate this Agreement by giving to Seller written notice of Purchaser's election to do so ("PURCHASER'S TERMINATION NOTICE"). If Purchaser fails to give a timely Purchaser's Termination Notice, then the right to give such Purchaser's Termination Notice shall be deemed waived. If Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section, Purchaser shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon. In such event, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and the parties shall have no further rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder. ARTICLE VII TITLE EXAMINATION AND SURVEY MATTERS 7.01 TITLE TO BE CONVEYED. Seller shall, on the Closing Date, transfer title to (a) the Real Property by the Deed on the Closing Date, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions, and (b) the Personal Property, and Seller shall also transfer to Purchaser the license interest in the Software as described in the Transfer License Agreement. 7.02 TITLE EXAMINATION. (a) Escrow Agent has delivered to Seller and Purchaser a preliminary title commitment for the Purchaser's Title Insurance, together with readable copies of all documents identified in Schedule B thereof and a Uniform Commercial Code search covering Seller and, as applicable, the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility (collectively called the "PRELIMINARY REPORT"). Purchaser shall have seven (7) Business Days after the Effective Date, to object to any matter disclosed in the Preliminary Title Report, Survey and/or Uniform Commercial Code Search that is not otherwise described herein as a Permitted Exception by giving written notice (the "TITLE DEFECT NOTICE") of the objection to Seller. The Survey was delivered initially without the areas specified in the Wetlands Inventory being displayed on that Survey. Such Survey (without the displayed areas from the Wetlands Inventory) shall be deemed received by Purchaser as of the Effective Date for the purpose of this paragraph (a) and Purchaser's initial title objections, if any. (b) If, after the initial issuance of the Preliminary Report and giving of the initial Title Defect Notice, Escrow Agent amends the Preliminary Report by adding a new exception thereto, the surveyor modifies the Survey (other than with respect to displaying the areas specified in the Wetlands Inventory, unless such display results in the addition of a new title exception in the Preliminary Report) or new filings appear in an updated Uniform Commercial Code search, Purchaser shall be entitled to give a Title Defect Notice to such exception within five (5) calendar days after receipt of the amendment, a copy of any instrument(s) referred to therein and an updated Survey (if necessary to show the location of the referenced item) to reflect the matter disclosed by the amendment are received by Purchaser. Any matters not referenced in a timely Title Defect Notice shall be deemed approved by Purchaser. Page 19 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
7.03 CURING AND REMOVAL OF TITLE OBJECTIONS. Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of a Title Defect Notice, do one of the following: (a) Seller may notify Purchaser that Seller cannot or will not attempt to remove or otherwise cure the objection set forth in the Title Defect Notice. If Seller so notifies Purchaser, Purchaser shall, on or before the third (3rd) Business Day after Seller's notice is received, by giving notice to Seller, do one of the following: (i) elect to proceed with the Closing, in which event such objections shall be conclusively presumed thereafter to be waived by Purchaser and the Closing shall occur without any credit against the Purchase Price on account thereof; or (ii) elect to terminate this Agreement, in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon and, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and the parties shall have no further rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder; or (b) Seller may notify Purchaser that Seller will attempt to remove or cure the objections. If, after giving notice to Purchaser in accordance with this clause (b), Seller is not able to remove or cure the objections, Seller shall so notify Purchaser and Purchaser shall have the right to make an election as if Seller had given notice in accordance with clause (a) above. If Purchaser gives a termination notice pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(ii), even after the First Contingency Period, those provisions regarding return of the Deposit and termination of the Agreement in Section 7.03(a)(ii) shall control over any other provision of this Agreement that provides that the Deposit is not refundable after expiration of the First Contingency Period. 7.04 PROCESS AND SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS. (a) If Seller fails to give timely notice under either clause 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) above, Seller shall be deemed to have made the election under clause 7.03(a) and Purchaser shall have the right to elect to proceed or to terminate pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(i) or 7.03(a)(ii) above. (b) If Purchaser does not give notice of Purchaser's election to terminate under Section 7.03(a)(ii) above, Purchaser shall be conclusively presumed to have agreed to accept title subject to the matters objected to in the Title Defect Notice, and the Closing shall occur without any credit against the Purchase Price, subject to Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller agrees to satisfy, release and cure any objections set forth in a Title Defect Notice with respect to any mortgages, deeds of trust, judgment liens, mechanics' or materialmen's liens, security interests, pledges, delinquent taxes or assessments or other monetary encumbrances (i.e., a current monetary charge upon the Real Property) that encumber the Real Property, the Personal Property and/or Page 20 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
the Software other than the Permitted Exceptions currently listed in Schedule 2 of Exhibit B and other than those that cover pre-Closing and post-Closing periods and are prorated at Closing. ARTICLE VIII CLOSING 8.01 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING. (a) The date of Closing shall be October 31, 2002. Seller may, in its sole and absolute discretion, however, upon prior written notice ("Acceleration Notice"), given at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. on August 15, 2002, require Purchaser to close the purchase at an earlier date following satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing, but in no event later than August 30, 2002. The date upon which Closing occurs, whether October 31, 2002, or an earlier date based upon an Acceleration Notice, is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

Reimbursement of Reimbursable Expenses between the Closing Date and October 31, 2002, shall remain Seller's obligation, subject to the following: such Reimbursable Expenses are estimated to be $3.5 million during the period between August 30, 2002, and October 31, 2002. Seller's reimbursement obligation will be funded solely from the Escrow Fund. Seller shall have no obligation or responsibility to (i) directly fund any of the Reimbursable Expenses, (ii) to reimburse Purchaser for any Reimbursable Expenses other than from funds in the Escrow Fund, or (iii) increase to Escrow Fund. Any funds not withdrawn by Purchaser from Escrow Fund to cover Reimbursable Expenses shall be disbursed to Seller within the time period set forth in the Escrow Agreement. (c) The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date through Escrow at the offices of Purchaser's counsel, Preston Gates & Ellis LLP, 222 SW Columbia Street, Portland, Oregon 97201. 8.02 PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION. After Closing, Purchaser shall submit to Seller a statement setting forth an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Real Property, the Building, the Improvements, the Personal Property and the Software. Unless the statement of allocation is manifestly unreasonable, then the parties shall accept such statement for the purpose of reporting this transaction to the Internal Revenue Service and any other Governmental Entities to whom such reporting is required.

(b) As part of Purchaser's agreement to purchase the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility "AS IS WITH ALL FAULTS," and not as a limitation on such agreement, Purchaser hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all actual or potential rights that Purchaser might have regarding any other form of representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind or type, relating to the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility. Such waiver is absolute, complete, total and unlimited in every way. (c) Without in any way limiting the generality of the preceding paragraphs, in entering into this Agreement and purchasing the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility, Purchaser hereby acknowledges that Seller, its employees, directors, officers, agents, consultants, contractors and brokers have not made, do not hereby make and will not hereafter be deemed to have made, any other representations or warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, to Purchaser, with respect to this transaction, the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility or the condition thereof, including without limitation: (i) the quality, nature, adequacy and condition of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility, including, but not limited to, the electrical, mechanical, HVAC, plumbing, sewage, utility systems, structural elements, foundation, roof, appurtenances, access, landscaping and parking facilities; (ii) the quality, nature, adequacy and physical condition of soils, geology and groundwater; (iii) the existence, quality, nature, adequacy and physical condition of utilities servicing the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility; (iv) the development potential of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility and the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility's use, habitability, merchantability, fitness, suitability and value; (v) the zoning of the Real Property or any other public or private restrictions on use of the Real Property, including without limitation, the location of applicable flood plains; (vi) the compliance of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility or its operation with any applicable codes, laws and restrictions of any governmental or quasi-Governmental Entity or of any other person or entity, including without limitation any Environmental Law; (vii) the presence of Hazardous Substances on, under, in, or about the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility; (viii) the existence, status, restrictions and transferability of the Permits; (ix) the operational characteristics, capacities, and physical or operating condition of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility; Page 29 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

The provisions of this Section 9.03 shall survive Closing or any termination of this Agreement for any reason. ARTICLE X DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 10.01 PURCHASER'S DEFAULTS AND SELLER'S REMEDIES. (a) PURCHASER'S DEFAULTS. It shall be a default by Purchaser under this Agreement (a "PURCHASER'S DEFAULT") if any one or more of the following shall occur: (i) Unless this Agreement is sooner terminated by Purchaser, as permitted in this Agreement, if Purchaser fails to (x) pay the Purchase Price on the Closing Date, or (y) perform its other agreements contained in this Agreement and such failure under this clause (a) shall continue for ten (10) Business Days after Seller gives Purchaser notice of such failure, but in any event not beyond the Closing Date; or (ii) any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall prove to have been materially false, incorrect or incomplete when made. (b) SELLER'S REMEDIES FOR PURCHASER'S DEFAULT. If Purchaser fails to close this transaction when Purchaser is required to do so, Seller shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to immediately receive the Deposit and all interest earned thereon as liquidated damages, in which case this Agreement shall be deemed terminated and, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder. If Purchaser fails, without legal excuse, to complete the purchase of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility, the Deposit made by Purchaser and all interest thereon shall be forfeited to Seller as the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller for such failure. In the event the close of escrow and the consummation of the transaction herein contemplated do not occur by reason of any Purchaser Default, Purchaser and Seller agree that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to estimate the damages that Seller may suffer. Therefore, Purchaser and Seller agree that a reasonable estimate of the total Page 30 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
net detriment that Seller would suffer in the event of a Purchaser Default and fails to complete the purchase of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility is and shall be an amount equal to the Deposit and interest thereon. This amount shall be the full, agreed, and liquidated damages for Purchaser's failure to close by Purchaser. The payment of this amount as liquidated damages is not intended as a forfeiture or penalty, but is intended to constitute liquidated damages to Seller. This liquidated damages remedy is Seller's sole remedy for Purchaser's failure to close, except for (i) Seller's right to enforce the NDA, (ii) Seller's right to enforce Purchaser's obligations as set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 and Seller's right to enforce Purchaser's obligation to deliver documents and reports to Seller pursuant to any other provisions of this Agreement, (iii) Seller's right to require Purchaser to return the due diligence documents as set forth in Section 5.02, and (iv) Seller rights under Section 12.01. 10.02 SELLER'S DEFAULT AND PURCHASER'S REMEDIES. (a) SELLER'S DEFAULTS. It shall be a default by Seller under this Agreement (a "SELLER'S DEFAULT") if either or both of the following shall occur: (i) Unless this Agreement is sooner terminated, as permitted in this Agreement, if Seller fails to perform its agreements contained in this Agreement and such failure under this clause (a) shall continue for ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser gives Seller notice of such failure, but, in any event, not beyond the Closing Date; or (ii) any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement shall prove to have been materially false, incorrect or incomplete when made, subject to Seller's one-time right to update its disclosure Schedules as provided in Section 9.01. (b) PURCHASER'S REMEDIES FOR SELLER'S DEFAULT. If a Seller's Default occurs, then, following the expiration of the cure or grace period, if any (and assuming Seller has not cured such Seller Default within such period), provided in subsection (a) above, Purchaser shall have the right to pursue one of the following remedies: (i) terminate this Agreement by giving notice thereof to Seller, in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon and shall be entitled to recover as exclusive damages Purchaser's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in conducting its due diligence investigation of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility; (ii) seek specific performance of Seller's obligations under this Agreement, including (A) any incidental damages and (B) consequential damages if Seller failed to close other than based upon a good faith dispute, or (iii) terminate this Agreement by giving notice thereof to Seller, receiving immediate return of the Deposit and all interest earned and pursuing a damage claim (beyond return of the Deposit and interest) for the breach provided that the damage claim may not exceed, unless based upon Fraud or a breach of the Fundamental Warranties, an additional amount equal to the Deposit plus prevailing party attorneys' fees and costs in the litigation. Page 31 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
10.03 SURVIVAL. In addition to other provisions that expressly survive Closing, the provisions of this Article X shall survive Closing. ARTICLE XI CONDITION/DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION 11.01 EMINENT DOMAIN AND CONDEMNATION. (a) If, at any time prior to Closing, a material portion of the Real Property (which is defined to mean such portion of the Real Property that will substantially interfere with Purchaser's use thereof or any portion of the Building or Equipment) is taken or condemned or becomes the subject of any eminent domain or condemnation proceeding, or if Seller receives notice from any Governmental Entity with the right to exercise the power of eminent domain that it desires or intends to take a material portion of the Real Property (as defined above), then Seller shall so notify Purchaser and Purchaser may, at its sole discretion, elect by notice to Seller before the Closing Date, as its sole and exclusive remedy, either to (i) terminate this Agreement, in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon and, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and the parties shall have no further rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder; or (ii) accept the Real Property subject to such condemnation proceeding or in the condition in which it is left following such condemnation or taking and receive either the full amount of the condemnation award that Seller has received for the Real Property or, if Seller has not received such award on or before the Closing Date, accept an assignment from Seller, in form and content reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, of Seller's rights to such award. (b) If, at any time prior to Closing, less than a material portion of the Real Property (as defined in Section 11.01[a]) is taken or condemned or becomes the subject of any eminent domain or condemnation proceeding or if Seller receives notice from any governmental entity with the right to exercise the power of eminent domain that it desires or intends to take less than a material portion of the Real Property), then Seller shall so notify Purchaser and Purchaser agrees to accept the Real Property subject to such condemnation proceeding or in the condition in which it is left following such condemnation or taking and receive either the full amount of the condemnation award that Seller has received for the Real Property or, if Seller has not received said award on or before the Closing Date, accept an assignment from Seller, in form and content reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, of Seller's rights to such award. 11.02 DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION. If, at any time prior to Closing, all or any portion of the Building, Personal Property, or Software is wholly or partially damaged or destroyed as a result of fire or other casualty not caused by Purchaser, its agents, contractors, representatives, consultants or employees, and if such damage or destruction cannot be repaired prior to Closing in full compliance with all applicable laws (including Environmental Laws) and otherwise in a manner Page 32 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
acceptable to Purchaser, then Purchaser may give notice to Seller terminating this Agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days of the later of (a) the date Seller notifies Purchaser in writing of such casualty, or (ii) Purchaser learns of such casualty. In the event of such termination, Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to receive the Deposit and all interest earned thereon and, except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect, and the parties shall have no rights, obligations and liabilities hereunder. If Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.02, then the Closing shall take place, and at Closing, Seller will assign insurance proceeds up to the amount of the Purchase Price less amounts used towards restoration that Seller has completed. At the Closing, Seller shall also pay Purchaser the amount of the deductible under any insurance policy that covers the damage. In no event shall Seller be obligated to undertake any restoration. ARTICLE XII BROKER AND ADVISOR Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that no broker has acted as an intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for Seller's Broker. Seller shall pay the commission due to Seller's Broker and any fees due Seller's Advisors. Seller and Purchaser each hereby represents and warrants to the other that it has not dealt with any other broker, advisor, finder or other intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that no other such fees or commissions are due or payable by it to any other third party by reason of any of the said transactions. Seller and Purchaser each agrees further to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless of, from and against any and all costs, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses and other obligations (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising from or in connection with or otherwise resulting from a breach of their respective representations and warranties contained in this Section 12.01 or any claim by any broker, advisor, finder, intermediary or other third party claiming to have been employed by or at the direction of the indemnifying party. The provisions of this Section 12.01 shall survive the Closing. ARTICLE XIII OPERATING COVENANT AND POSSESSION 13.01 OPERATION OF GRESHAM MANUFACTURING DIVISION FACILITY. Until the Closing Date, Seller agrees to operate and maintain the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility in the condition and in the manner as it is operated and maintained as of the Effective Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted (and except as provided in Article XI) including but not limited to the following: (a) Seller shall keep its certificate(s) of occupancy for the Building and all other Permits, Software and/or Utility Agreements in full force and effect until the Closing Date. Section (C) of Schedule 1.02(C) lists Seller's agreement with IGI Resources, Inc. ("IGI Agreement"). The transportation component of the IGI Agreement currently expires October 1, 2002, and the supply component Page 33 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
currently expires January 31, 2003. Seller shall use best efforts to cause IGI Resources, Inc. to agree to extension of the transportation component through January 31, 2003, terminable between October 1, 2002, and January 31, 2003, upon 30 days' notice by the holder of the IGI Agreement, without payment of a premium or penalty payable by the holder of the IGI Agreement. The month-to-month extension of the IGI Agreement shall be a contingency to be satisfied or waived during the First Contingency Period under Section 6.08(a). If Purchaser desires to continue service under the IGI Agreement after Closing, Purchaser will assume the IGI Agreement at Closing. Regarding the other agreements listed in Schedule 1.02(C) that indicate Purchaser desires to have extended on a month-to-month basis, Seller shall use Seller's best efforts, at no additional expense to Seller, to obtain a month-to-month extension (terminable upon thirty [30] days' advanced written notice), which Purchaser shall assume on a month-to-month basis, at Closing, if such extensions are obtained. The failure of Seller to obtain one or more of those month-to-month extensions shall not be a condition of Closing. Seller shall also keep the contracts identified as the BOC Edwards Contracts in the first two rows of Section C on Schedule 1.02(C) (hereinafter the "BOC Contract") in full force and effect after Closing until Purchaser notifies Seller of Purchaser's desire to have Seller cancel the BOC Contract, which notice shall be given no later than 120 days after the Closing, or if not so given, shall be deemed given on the 120th day, and Seller shall, unless Seller and Purchaser otherwise agree, thereafter terminate the BOC Contract. During the period after Closing in which the BOC Contract is in effect and until thirty (30) days after Purchaser gives notice to Seller of Purchaser's desire that Seller terminate the BOC Contract, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller (within five [5] Business Days of written demand) for the monthly charges under the BOC Contract attributable to the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility. Seller shall retain sole responsibility and liability for any and all costs associated with the eventual termination of the BOC Contract. This Section 13.01(a) shall survive Closing. (b) Seller shall maintain the Real Property, including all of the Improvements, in substantially the same condition as of the Effective Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and shall not demolish or remove any of the existing Improvements or erect new improvements on the Real Property or any portion thereof without the prior written consent of Purchaser. (c) Seller shall continue to preserve the Equipment either in substantial accordance with (i) the recommendations of the manufacturers of the Equipment, or (ii) Seller's standard decommissioning procedures and shall not remove or modify the Equipment (other than such modifications as are necessary to keep the Equipment in such condition under the above standard) except as provided in Section 6.05. 13.02 POSSESSION. Purchaser shall be entitled to possession on the Closing Date, subject to the rights of the holders of the Permitted Exceptions. 13.03 EMPLOYEES. Seller shall terminate or relocate all of its employees at the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility prior to the Closing Date and shall be solely responsible for any employment loss (as defined in the Workers Adjustment and Page 33 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC. Sections 2101-2109, hereinafter the "WARN Act"). Seller shall indemnify and defend Purchaser for, from and against, and agree to hold Purchaser harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and other liabilities and obligations incurred or suffered as a result of any claim by any of Seller's employees that arises under federal, state or local statute (including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the WARN Act, ERISA and all other statutes regulating the terms and conditions of employment), regulation or ordinance, under the common law or in equity (including any claims for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any policy, agreement, understanding or promise, written or oral, formal or informal, between Seller and the employees, arising out of actions, events or omissions that occurred (or, in the case of omissions, failed to occur) on or before the Closing. The foregoing indemnity obligation of Seller contained in this Section 13.03 shall survive the Closing or sooner termination of this Agreement. 13.04 POST-CLOSING STORAGE, MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL. Seller shall be permitted to store, maintain and remove the Excluded Assets at the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility during the Post-Closing Period, free of charge. Such storage, maintenance and removal shall occur in accordance with the following standards ("Standards"): (i) Seller shall carry liability insurance for the benefit of Purchaser (in amounts specified by Purchaser but consistent with its standard policies), (ii) Seller shall access the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility in a manner that avoids interference with Purchaser's business operations, (iii) Seller shall promptly repair, at Seller's expense, any damage to the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility arising from removal of the Excluded Assets during the Post-Closing Period, (iv) Seller shall coordinate such removal with Purchaser in advance of such removal, and (v) Seller's access shall be in full compliance with Purchaser's reasonable security and engineering provisions and the provisions of the NDA. The Excluded Assets being removed during the Post-Closing Period will be those referenced in items 2, 3 and 8 in Schedule 1.04 and in Schedule 1.04(A). During the First Contingency Period, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to develop further standards governing such storage, maintenance and removal, although the failure to agree on such additional standards shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by either party or a condition precedent to the Closing. The foregoing rights and obligations of Seller contained in this Section 13.04 shall survive the Closing and for a period of one (1) year after last day Seller was on the Real Property to effect such removal. 13.05 POST-CLOSING ASSISTANCE WITH SOFTWARE AND START-UP; USE OF TRAILER. During the Post-Closing Period and until December 31, 2002, Seller may use construction trailer (identified as E20) ("Trailer") the Trailer for purposes of establishing offices for its engineering and administrative personnel responsible for the storage, maintenance and removal activities described in Section 13.04 and other administrative activities incidental to the wind-down of its activities at the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility. During the Post-Closing Period and to the extent consistent with their activities for Seller under Section 13.04 and so long as they remain present at the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility, Seller shall make its engineering personnel located in the Trailer available for consultation with Purchaser regarding their understanding of proper utilization of the Tool Set and the Building and Page 35 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
associated facilities. Should such engineering staff be reassigned from the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility by Seller prior to the end of the Post-Closing Period, Seller shall provide Purchaser with e-mail and telephonic contact information for such personnel who shall, to the extent consistent with their other duties for Seller or its parent company, respond by means of e-mail or telephonic communication on the proper utilization of the Tool Set and the Building and associated facilities during the remainder of the Post-Closing Period. Seller shall also provide Purchaser e-mail and telephonic contact information for the former information technology manager, who shall be available during the Post-Closing Period, consistent with such person's principal duties for Seller, to consult regarding utilization of the Software. During the time Seller's employees are using the Trailer, Seller shall bear sole responsibility for the expense of all power and communication utilities provided to the Trailer. The foregoing obligation of Purchaser contained in this Section 13.05 shall survive the Closing and for a period of one (1) year after the last day Seller occupies the Trailer. 13.06 NOISE EASEMENT. Seller owns the residential real property adjacent to the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility and having an address of 201 SE 214th Avenue, Gresham, Oregon. Prior to the earlier of (a) sale of that property by Seller, or (b) Closing, Seller agrees to record at its sole cost a noise easement against that property that runs with the land for the benefit of the Real Property in the form previously approved by Purchaser, such that the owners or occupants of that property may not assert a claim against Purchaser or the owner of the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility for excessive noise or for nuisance arising out of noise generated by the Gresham Manufacturing Division Facility. 13.07 CHEMICALS AND SOLID WASTE REMOVAL. Prior to or during the Post-Closing Period, Seller shall (i) in full compliance with all Environmental Laws relating to the removal (including obtaining a temporary Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ["RCRA"] identification number for any post-Closing removal requiring a RCRA identification number), (ii) in a manner that avoids interference with Purchaser's business, and (iii) in full compliance with Purchaser's reasonable security and engineering provisions and the provisions of the NDA: (a) Remove all above ground solid waste (E.G., scrap metal, trash, obsolete equipment, vendor supplies, ET CETERA) from the "bone yard," which is the fenced area located behind the QUONSET hut (the "Bone Yard"). (b) Remove and dispose of all RCRA designated waste and drums from the Building and Bone Yard in accordance with Seller's normal operating standards. (c) Remove all non-bulk, non-process chemicals from the Building and Bone Yard that would be required to be "lab packed," such as squirt bottles and open chemical containers, that Purchaser may designate for removal during the First Contingency Period. Page 36 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
(d) Remove all previously opened non-bulk process chemicals during the First Contingency Period. (e) Recycle all recyclable materials that have been sorted and set aside by Seller for such purpose. (f) Remove all Excluded Assets listed in items 2, 3 and 8 in Schedule 1.04 and in Schedule 1.04(A). (g) Remove all other tools and equipment in the Building that Purchaser may designate for removal during the First Contingency Period, provided that such tools or equipment meet all of the following standards: (i) are not on any of the Asset Schedules as being an asset being purchased by Purchaser, (ii) are readily removable without any damage to the Building or the facilities therein (I.E., are not fixtures or bulk equipment), and (iii) would require decontamination under the Environmental Laws prior to disposal. (h) Properly store and label all remaining chemicals in storage in the Building in accordance with Seller's normal operating standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller need not take any of these actions with respect to any items or chemicals brought into the Building or the Bone Yard by Purchaser or Purchaser's agents, vendors or contractors. The foregoing obligations of Seller contained in this Section 13.07 shall survive the Closing or sooner termination of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after the last day Seller was on the Real Property to effect such removal. 13.08 ZONING VIOLATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL COMPLIANCE. If required (I.E., if the Bone Yard is not cleared as specified in Section 13.07 prior to Closing), Seller agrees, prior to Closing, to provide a site-obstructing fence or fence covering mutually agreeable to the parties to comply with the Gresham Zoning Code (GMC Section .0330). Seller shall use its best efforts to provide Purchaser (both before and after Closing) with final documentation from the applicable Governmental Entity that any existing mitigation obligations and outstanding regulatory enforcement actions relating to the Real Property (including responses to current notices of violation or noncompliance) that are within the Knowledge of Seller, or have been identified to Seller by Purchaser during the Contingency Period, have been fully addressed, except for the current wetlands enforcement action (which is governed by Section 6.07). In addition, Seller shall defend and indemnify Purchaser with respect to any acts or omissions by or on behalf of Seller prior to Closing which become the subject of regulatory enforcement action in the forms of fines or penalties after Closing, relating to those instances listed in Schedule 9.01(B). The foregoing obligations of Seller contained in this Section 13.08 shall survive the Closing. 13.09 SELLER INDEMNITY DURING POST-CLOSING PERIOD. Seller agrees to defend, indemnify and save Purchaser, its employees, officers, directors, representatives, invitees and agents harmless from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, losses, damages, suits, Page 37 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
proceedings and other obligations (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) to the extent resulting from any negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct of Seller, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees, with respect to all post-Closing activities of Seller, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees on the Real Property. If any negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct involves parties other than Seller, its consultants, agents, contractors, representatives and employees, then Seller's labiality shall be limited to that portion of any damages or liability attributable solely to Seller's negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct. The foregoing indemnity obligation of Seller contained in this Section 13.09 shall survive for a period of one (1) year following the negligent act or omission or intentional misconduct. 13.10 REMOVAL OF BOC EQUIPMENT. One of the service contracts that Purchaser is not assuming is that certain On-Site Product Supply Agreement with The BOC Group, Inc. (the "BOC Contract"). To the extent that Purchaser determines, during the First Contingency Period, that it will not add the BOC Contract as one of the Permits that Purchaser will assume, then Purchaser agrees to permit Seller and BOC Group, Inc., to remove BOC Group, Inc.'s equipment as specified in the BOC Contract, but subject to the Standards. Unless the BOC Contract permits a longer period for removal, such removal shall be completed on or before the end of the Post-Closing Period. The foregoing provisions of this Section 13.10 shall survive the Closing and for a period of one (1) year thereafter. 13.11 REMEDIATION AGREEMENT. (a) Seller has undertaken, at it sole expense, an investigation of Hazardous Substances potentially associated with discarded drums, containers, pipes, and other debris (collectively referred to as "Debris") at locations within the "Debris Area" as shown on the map marked Exhibit H, attached hereto. Seller's consultants have opined that there is no release or threatened release of Hazardous Substances within the Debris Area that require any further investigation and that no cleanup of Hazardous Substances is necessary. (b) On or before Closing, the Seller shall remove and dispose of the exposed or partially exposed Debris from the Debris Area. Seller shall prepare a Work Plan for the removal, and Seller shall promptly provide and use best efforts to provide, not later than July 30, 2002, a copy of that Work Plan to Purchaser and to complete the removal before Closing. Within ten (10) days of the completion of the removal, Seller will provide Purchaser with a written closure report (the "Closure Report") that confirms the completion of the Work Plan, and which shall include all sampling and analytical results. Regardless of any other provisions in this or any other agreement, and after Closing, Purchaser can then treat both the Work Plan and the Closure Report generated in conjunction with the removal as a public document not subject to any confidentiality or disclosure restrictions. Regardless of any other provision in this or any other agreement, including but not limited to any confidentiality or disclosure restrictions, and prior to Closing, the Work Plan and the Closure Report may be disclosed by either party to the City of Gresham, or with the consent of the Seller, by the Purchaser to any other person.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K Current Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) August 23, 2002 MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED (Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 0-21184 86-062904 (State or other jurisdiction of (Commission File No.) (IRS Employer incorporation) Identification Number) 2355 West Chandler Boulevard, Chandler, Arizona 85224-6199 (Address of principal executive offices) (480) 792-7200 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code)
ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. On August 23, 2002, we closed the acquisition of a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon from Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc., referred to as FMI. The acquisition was pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement between us and FMI, dated as of July 17, 2002, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed on July 18, 2002. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we acquired, subject to specific exclusions as set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, certain of the assets of FMI, consisting of an approximately 140-acre campus, buildings totaling approximately 826,500 square feet (including approximately 200,000 square feet of clean room space) and manufacturing equipment. The total purchase price was $183.5 million in cash, which we paid from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances. We intend to use the facility to manufacture semiconductors. FMI manufactured semiconductors at the facility. We negotiated the purchase price at arm's length and there is no material relationship between FMI and us or any of our affiliates, or our officers or directors or the associates of any such officer or director. As part of the transaction, FMI donated approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the manufacturing facility, which is largely designated as a natural resource area, directly to the City of Gresham, Oregon for local and regional open space. At closing, the approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the manufacturing facility was transferred directly by FMI to the City of Gresham, Oregon. The transfer of the 60 acres to the City of Gresham did not result in a reduction of the total purchase price. The remaining approximately 140 acres, including the approximately 60 acres where the manufacturing facilities are located, provides us with ample land for future facility expansion and site development. One of the closing conditions of our acquisition of the Gresham facility was the qualification of the Gresham facility under the state of Oregon's Strategic Investment Program, or SIP. Final state of Oregon approval was obtained on August 23, 2002. The SIP will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2003 and will be effective for a period of seven years. The SIP will provide us with a partial property tax exemption on the Gresham facility. The SIP exemption requires us to pay property tax on the first $100,000,000.00 of assessed value of the Gresham facility; the $100,000,000.00 taxable base increases each year by three percent. To maintain the SIP once it becomes effective on July 1, 2003, we must comply with certain requirements including: * meeting certain minimum employment levels in each of the years covered by the SIP * complying with a first source hiring agreement regarding hiring of new employees at the Gresham facility, and * annual contributions to the Mt. Hood Community College Microelectronics Training Center.
A copy of the SIP agreement between us, Multnomah County, Oregon and the City of Gresham, Oregon is filed as Exhibit 2.2 to this report on Form 8-K. We currently intend to maintain our Fab 3 (Puyallup, Washington) manufacturing facility until it is required for future production. We are, however, evaluating whether an impairment charge on Fab 3 will be required following our acquisition of the Gresham facility. If required, we expect that such impairment charge would be taken in the quarter ending September 30, 2002. Now that the acquisition of the Gresham, Oregon facility has been completed, we will commence relocating the manufacturing process equipment from Fab 3 to our wafer fabrication facilities in Chandler (Fab 1) and Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2), and will also begin relocating certain equipment from Fab 3 to the Gresham, Oregon facility to create a closer equipment match to our Fab 2 wafer fabrication facility in order to facilitate a quicker process start at the Gresham facility. THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS RELATED TO THE 140-ACRES PROVIDING AMPLE LAND FOR FUTURE FACILITY EXPANSION AND SITE DEVELOPMENT, OUR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN OUR PUYALLUP MANUFACTURING FACILITY UNTIL IT IS REQUIRED FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, EVALUATION OF THE PUYALLUP FACILITY TO DETERMINE IF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WILL BE REQUIRED FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE GRESHAM FACILITY, THE TIMING OF ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT FROM THE PUYALLUP FACILITY TO OUR OTHER MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND THE RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT FACILITATING A QUICKER PROCESS START IN THE GRESHAM FACILITY ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS; DELAYS IN PERMIT TRANSFERS AND/OR FACILITIZATION OF THE GRESHAM FACILITY; OUR ABILITY TO RAMP PRODUCTS INTO VOLUME PRODUCTION AT THE GRESHAM FACILITY; AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT AND OTHER SUPPLIES; THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE GRESHAM AREA; COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS COMPETING ARCHITECTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETS WE GENERALLY SERVE; OUR TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES; IMPACTS OF EVENTS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, SUCH AS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF FLUCTUATING CURRENCIES OR UNREST OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY; DISRUPTIONS IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OR DELIVERY OCCASIONED BY TERRORIST ACTIVITY, ARMED CONFLICT, WAR OR AN UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF, OR DECREASE IN SUPPLY OF, OIL; AND GENERAL INDUSTRY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

AGREEMENT This Agreement is by and between Multnomah County (the "County"), the City of Gresham (the "City") and Microchip Technology Incorporated ("MCHP"), 2355 West Chandler Blvd., Chandler, Arizona 85224-6199. I. RECITALS. A. MCHP has requested that the County approve a partial property tax exemption for a project in Gresham, Oregon. MCHP has provided the following information to the County about MCHP and its operations: COMPANY OVERVIEW HEADQUARTERED IN CHANDLER, ARIZONA, MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INC. IS A LEADING GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURER WITH DESIGN, MANUFACTURING AND SALES OPERATIONS LOCATED THROUGHOUT ASIA, EUROPE, JAPAN AND THE AMERICAS. * FOUNDED IN 1989 * PUBLICLY HELD (NASDAQ: MCHP) * $571 MILLION IN SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002 (ENDING MARCH 31, 2002) * PRODUCT LINES: PICMICRO(R) MICROCONTROLLERS AND DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS; STAND-ALONE ANALOG AND INTERFACE, SERIAL EEPROMS, AND RFID * APPROXIMATELY 3,100 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE * 24 SALES OFFICES WORLDWIDE * MANUFACTURING FACILITIES: CHANDLER AND TEMPE, AZ; PUYALLUP, WA; BANGKOK, THAILAND * DESIGN CENTERS: BANGALORE, INDIA; LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND; MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA; CHANDLER, AZ * MCHP'S QUALITY SYSTEMS ARE ISO 9001 AND QS-9000 CERTIFIED * CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS: 2355 W. CHANDLER BLVD., CHANDLER, AZ 85224 USA MCHP WAS FORMED IN 1989 WHEN A GROUP OF VENTURE CAPITALISTS ACQUIRED THE SEMICONDUCTOR DIVISION OF GENERAL INSTRUMENT. A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM, LEAD BY STEVE SANGHI, WAS INSTALLED IN 1990. THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN 1993 WITH A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. BY 1997, THE COMPANY RANKED SECOND IN WORLDWIDE SHIPMENTS OF 8-BIT MICROCONTROLLERS (ACCORDING TO DATAQUEST). MCHP HAS ACQUIRED SEVERAL COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO COMPLEMENT ITS GROWING PRODUCT PORTFOLIO INCLUDING: TELCOM SEMICONDUCTOR IN 2001 AND POWERSMART IN 2002. PRODUCTS AND MARKETS SERVED MCHP MANUFACTURES THE POPULAR PICMICRO(R) FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE RISC MICROCONTROLLERS, WHICH SERVE 8- AND 16-BIT EMBEDDED CONTROL APPLICATIONS, AND A BROAD SPECTRUM OF HIGH PERFORMANCE LINEAR AND MIXED-SIGNAL, POWER MANAGEMENT AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT DEVICES. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS COMPLEMENTARY MICROPERIPHERAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING INTERFACE DEVICES; MICROID(R) Page 1 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
RFID DEVICES; SERIAL EEPROMS; AND THE PATENTED KEELOQ(R) SECURITY DEVICES. THIS SYNERGISTIC PRODUCT PORTFOLIO TARGETS THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS AND A GROWING DEMAND FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE DESIGNS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTING, CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL CONTROL MARKETS. MCHP'S PRODUCTS ARE FOUND IN HUNDREDS OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES SERVING THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS WORLDWIDE. SAMPLE CUSTOMER COMPANIES INCLUDE: GENIE, SANYO, TOYOTA, DELPHI, JOHNSON CONTROLS, LEXUS, APPLE COMPUTER, IBM, ERICSSON, NOKIA, GENERAL ELECTRIC AND WHIRLPOOL. TYPICAL APPLICATIONS CAN INCLUDE: GARAGE DOOR OPENERS, CORDLESS TOOLS, WHITE GOODS APPLIANCES, REMOTE-KEYLESS-ENTRY SYSTEMS, AUTOMOTIVE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING AND AIR BAG SENSORS, COMPUTER MOUSE AND KEYBOARDS, CELLULAR TELEPHONES, PAGERS, MOTOR CONTROL AND ROBOTICS. AN EMBEDDED CONTROL SYSTEM IS TYPICALLY BURIED OR HIDDEN WITHIN THE APPLICATION, PROVIDING THE ELECTRONICS INTELLIGENCE TO THE END PRODUCT. IN MANY CASES THE CONSUMER DOES NOT KNOW THERE IS A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE POWERING FUNCTIONS WITHIN A "SMART" CLOTHES WASHING MACHINE, FOR EXAMPLE. WITH A MICROCONTROLLER-BASED EMBEDDED SYSTEM, THE MICROCONTROLLER WOULD ALLOW THE WASHING MACHINE TO DETERMINE LOAD SIZE, TYPE AND COLOR OF FABRIC, AND AMOUNT OF DIRT IN THE WATER. THIS SYSTEM WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONTROL WATER TEMPERATURE AND LENGTH OF WASHING CYCLE. THE USER COULD EXPECT CLEAN CLOTHES EVERY TIME WHILE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE MACHINE HAS BEEN ENHANCED AND ENERGY COSTS LOWERED. WITH FEWER PARTS (COMPARED TO MECHANICAL TIMERS AND KNOBS), THE APPLIANCE MAY BE CHEAPER TO BUY AND REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE COSTS WOULD BE REDUCED. SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, MARKED BY VOLATILE SWINGS IN TECHNOLOGY AND MARKET DEMAND. THE COMPANIES HARDEST HIT IN THE CURRENT DOWNCYCLE WERE THOSE, SUCH AS FUJITSU MICROELECTRONICS, WHO MANUFACTURED COMMODITY MEMORY DEVICES, INCLUDING DRAMS AND FLASH MEMORY. THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED A SHARP AND PROLONGED DECLINE IN THIS INDUSTRY DOWNCYCLE. MCHP'S BUSINESS MODEL IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FUJITSU'S. MCHP DOES NOT MANUFACTURE STAND-ALONE FLASH MEMORY DEVICES OR OTHER DEVICES THAT TEND TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MARKET SWINGS. MCHP HAS A HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE THAT BETTER INSULATES MCHP FROM MARKET DOWNTURNS. AS A TECHNICALITY (AND TO AVOID CONFUSION), MCHP DOES FEATURE FLASH MEMORY ON A PORTION OF ITS MICROCONTROLLER PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THESE PRODUCTS COMPETE IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MARKETS THAN COMMODITY, STAND-ALONE FLASH MEMORY DEVICES. MCHP'S PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON A PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURE, MAKING THEM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MARKET SWINGS THAN COMMODITY DEVICES. SALES & EARNINGS GROWTH MCHP IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMING SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES IN TODAY'S CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED IT IS CURRENTLY SEEING AN UPWARD TREND IN DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, AND HAS RAISED EARNINGS GUIDANCE SEVERAL TIMES. MCHP WAS THE BEST PERFORMING STOCK IN THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX IN MAY 2002 (UP 91% YEAR OVER YEAR). THE COMPANY EFFECTED A 3-FOR-2 STOCK SPLIT IN THE FORM OF A STOCK DIVIDEND IN MAY 2002. Page 2 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
MCHP HAS MORE THAN 35,000 CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE, WITH SALES SPLIT EVENLY ACROSS THE EUROPEAN, ASIA/PACIFIC/JAPAN AND THE AMERICAS REGIONS. ABOUT 60% OF SALES ARE DERIVED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS WITH THE REMAINING GENERATED BY A DIRECT SALES FORCE. NO ONE CUSTOMER MAKES UP MORE THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL SALES, AND THE TOP 10 CUSTOMERS REPRESENT NO MORE THAN 10% OF TOTAL SALES. EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND CORPORATE CULTURE AT ITS INCEPTION IN 1989, MCHP CREATED A SET OF DEFINING PRINCIPLES TO PRODUCE A CORPORATE CULTURE THAT UNLEASHES THE POTENTIAL OF OUR SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE. THE DILIGENT PRACTICE OF THESE "GUIDING VALUES" HAS BEEN DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY'S INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, WORLD-CLASS QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND STRONG EMPLOYEE TALENT BASE. MCHP'S CORPORATE CULTURE EMBRACES EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND A TEAM ENVIRONMENT. EMPLOYMENT DIVERSITY AT MCHP, WE BELIEVE THAT "EMPLOYEES ARE OUR GREATEST STRENGTH." WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF ALL EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS TO BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS FREE FROM ANY DISCRIMINATION. WE PROVIDE A WORK ATMOSPHERE FREE OF HARASSMENT, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE FULL USE OF ABILITIES OF ALL QUALIFIED PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR AND WITH OUR COMPANY, REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, AGE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, MARITAL STATUS, DISABILITY, OR VETERAN STATUS. EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK FOR GRESHAM, OR INITIAL HIRING IS EXPECTED TO REACH APPROXIMATELY 60 PEOPLE DURING PRE-PRODUCTION PHASES. OVER THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT, MCHP BELIEVES THAT THE FACILITIES COULD EMPLOY MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE AS THE FACILITIES REACH VERY HIGH-VOLUME MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DURING THE TERM OF THE PROPOSED SIP. THE COMPANY IS ATTRACTED TO THE HIGHLY TRAINED AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEES IN THE AREA WHO WORKED FOR FUJISTU. MCHP IS LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS AS SPECIFIC POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE. MCHP'S ANTICIPATED STAFFING REQUIREMENTS ARE LOWER THAN THE HISTORICAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYED AT THIS FACILITY BY FUJITSU. MCHP RUNS HIGHLY EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND CERTAIN FUNCTIONAL AREAS WILL BE LOCATED AT THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IN CHANDLER, ARIZONA AND OTHER LOCATIONS, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT VOLUME PRODUCTION. SALARY & BENEFITS MCHP OFFERS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SALARY AND BENEFITS PACKAGE, INCLUDING MEDICAL, DENTAL, 401K, TUITION REIMBURSEMENT AND MUCH MORE. BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE EMPLOYEES' INTERESTS ARE TIED CLOSELY TO THOSE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, EVERY MCHP EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, WHEREBY EMPLOYEES CAN PURCHASE MCHP STOCK AT A DISCOUNTED RATE. GIVEN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION OVER TIME, THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS. ENVIRONMENTAL & SAFETY RECORD MCHP IS PROUD OF ITS STELLAR RECORD RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY ISSUES. MCHP'S ACCIDENT/INJURY RATE IS EXTREMELY LOW AND OUR PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE TRACK RECORD IS EXCELLENT. MCHP HAS A LONG HISTORY OF MEETING OR EXCEEDING LOCAL, STATE, FEDERAL AND EPA Page 3 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO INTEGRATE RECYCLING INTO ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTIONS MCHP HAS AN EXTENSIVE TRACK RECORD OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH MCHP OPERATES IN THE USA. AROUND THE WORLD, MCHP'S SALES AND MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS REGULARLY DONATE TO MANY SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, AND ITS EMPLOYEES HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME VOLUNTEERING IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. B. ORS 285B.380 to 285B.392 describes the process for obtaining the Strategic Investment Program ("SIP") partial tax exemption which is described in ORS 307.123. The Strategic Investment Program exemption requires the owner to pay property tax on the first one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) of value of the facilities which receives the exemption; that taxable base increases each year by three percent. The exemption is temporary, lasting no longer than 15 years. C. The SIP exemption is available only if the governing body of the county in which the facilities are located requests the Oregon Economic and Community Development Commission to undertake the facilities as an "eligible project" after a public hearing, and (i) the county and the city in which the facilities is located have approved the special provisions relating to the property tax exemption, (ii) the firm benefited by the exemption has agreed to pay to the county a community service fee ("CSF") equal to 25% of the property taxes which are exempted, not to exceed $2 million each year, and (iii) the applicant has reached agreement with the county on any other requirements related to the project. In addition, ORS 285B.383 requires the benefited business firm to enter into a first source hiring agreement with a publicly funded job training provider that will remain in effect until the end of the tax exemption. D. MCHP proposes to purchase the facilities of Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. ("FMI") in the City of Gresham. In 1995 the County approved a SIP exemption for FMI with the potential to exempt more than $1 billion of property value for a period of fifteen years. However, those facilities never received that exemption. Those facilities are not now in production, and have a tax value of approximately $175 million. Maintaining that level of value requires FMI to expend significant sums each month. If those expenditures are discontinued the value of the facilities would decline precipitously, and the jobs which currently exist at the facilities would be lost. FMI has solicited proposals to purchase the facilities. FMI received only one proposal from a company that would continue to operate the facilities. That proposal was made by MCHP. If the FMI facilities is not sold to MCHP all jobs at that facilities are highly likely to be lost. E. MCHP has negotiated an agreement with FMI to purchase the facilities for $183.5 million, subject to obtaining tax-related cost reductions tied to a SIP and to other limited participation from the State of Oregon to cover the time period between when MCHP takes possession of the facilities and when the SIP takes effect. MCHP proposes to increase employment at the facilities from its projected level at August 15, 2002 of approximately thirty (30) to more than three hundred (300) by December 31, 2008, but only if MCHP receives the SIP Page 4 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
exemption for a maximum assessed value of $490 million for a limited term of seven years, beginning with County fiscal year 2003-04. F. MCHP has requested the County and the City to approve its project, which consists of the purchase of FMI's facilities in Gresham and the improvement and equipping of those facilities (the "Project"), but limited to a total assessed value of no more than $490 million and a term of seven years as provided in this Agreement. G. The two SIP exemptions previously approved by the County have each been for more than one billion dollars of assessed value, and have had terms of 15 years. The MCHP SIP exemption is for a substantially smaller assessed value and for a substantially shorter period of time. However, that exemption is critical to the economics of the transaction and is a closing condition to the sale of the FMI facilities. MCHP considers the SIP exemption an essential inducement to MCHP's ultimate decision to select the County and the City in which to locate the Project. H. The County and the City have approved the terms of this Agreement, which contains the special provisions relating to the SIP exemption for the Project. I. On [date] 2002, the County held a public hearing and then requested that the Oregon Economic and Community Development Commission to determine that the Project is an "eligible project" under ORS 285B.380 to 285B.392, which will receive a SIP exemption. J. MCHP intends to act as an exemplary corporate citizen. The County and City understand that, to be an exemplary corporate citizen, MCHP must be able to operate the Project in a competitive manner responsive to semiconductor industry conditions. This Agreement therefore adjusts or conditions certain of MCHP's obligations upon conditions in the semiconductor industry, demand for product produced at the Project, and other factors which are beyond MCHP's control. The parties acknowledge that, if doubt arises about the nature or extent of MCHP's obligations under this Agreement, this Agreement should be interpreted in a manner that allows MCHP to operate the Project competitively while meeting the County's goals. Now therefore, in consideration of the following mutual promises, the parties agree as follows: II. LIMITATIONS ON QUALIFICATION OF PROJECT FOR EXEMPTION; FUTURE EXEMPTIONS. A. LIMITATIONS. The Project consists of the purchase, improvement and equipping of FMI's facilities in Gresham, Oregon. Only $490 million of assessed value of the Project will be eligible for the exemption, and any assessed value at the Project during the term of this Agreement which exceeds $490 million shall not be eligible for the SIP exemption. The Project shall receive the SIP exemption for only seven fiscal years, commencing with County fiscal Page 5 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
year 2003-04, and this Agreement and MCHP's SIP exemption shall terminate on June 30, 2010. Page 6 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
The maximum investments which MCHP expects to make, and the tax years in which those investments will appear on the tax rolls, are estimated to be: Page 7 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
B. SCHEDULE SHOWS MAXIMUM BENEFITS; EXEMPTION APPROVED UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, FUTURE EXEMPTIONS. 1. This schedule of investments is an estimate of the maximum level of investment which MCHP currently expects it will make at the Project. Actual investments at the Project may be substantially less, reducing the associated SIP benefit to MCHP. 2. This SIP exemption for MCHP is being approved under extraordinary circumstances: the economy has been in recession, jobs have been lost at FMI's facilities, and MCHP is asking for a substantially smaller, shorter SIP exemption than the County has approved in the past. MCHP may make significant improvements at the Project site which do not qualify for this SIP exemption. The County has no obligation to approve SIP exemptions for those improvements, and MCHP has no obligation to make those improvements. However, MCHP understands that, if MCHP seeks additional SIP exemptions, MCHP will be expected to make contributions toward the County's goals that significantly exceed the contributions required by this Agreement. C. VERIFICATION OF FACTUAL ASSUMPTIONS. MCHP has agreed to pay the County a SIP processing fee which is equal to the County's costs for consultants, but does not exceed $30,000. Those consultants will perform the following services to facilitate a Strategic Investment Program contract between MCHP and the County: (1) Economist. Review Strategic Investment Program application and associated economic analysis. The analysis is to include impacts on jobs, tax impacts on County and City of Gresham, verify depreciation schedules used for tax calculations, verify impact on County and City of Gresham infrastructure. Provide information to Integra Services (appraiser) as needed. Appear before the County Board and the City Council to provide expert testimony. (2) Appraiser. Appraise the land, personal property and facilities located at 21005 and 21015 SE Stark Street, Gresham, Oregon. Provide executive summary of a sales comparison appraisal to the County. This sum shall be paid to the County by August 15, 2002. III. STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OF MCHP. A. PAYMENT OF CSF. 1. Amount. For each year in which MCHP receives the Property Tax Abatement, MCHP shall pay to the County a Community Service Fee (CSF), as provided by ORS Page 8 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
285B.386(4)(b), equal to 25 percent of the property taxes abated in such tax year, but not exceeding $2 million. 2. By November 15. The CSF payment shall be made to the County Finance Manager no later than November 15 of each year, commencing with November 15, 2003. However, MCHP shall not be required to pay the CSF before ten business days after MCHP receives the invoice described in Section III.A.3, below. Payment shall be made based on an invoice submitted by the County to MCHP in such form and according to such method as shall be agreed to by the parties prior to November 15 of the tax year in which the Project is assessed and taxed. The payment shall be sent to: Name: David A. Boyer Position Title: Finance Director Address: Multnomah County, Oregon 501 SE Hawthorne Blvd, 4th Floor PO Box 14700 Portland, Oregon 97293 3. Statement 30 Days in Advance The County shall provide MCHP with a statement of the CSF due no less than 30 days prior to the due date. 4. Adjustments If the assessed value of the Project is adjusted after November 15 of any tax year in such a manner that property taxes due from MCHP for that year are reduced, and the reduction reduces the CSF for that year, the County shall pay the amount of the reduction to MCHP, together with interest at the rate established by law for tax refunds (ORS 311.505(2)) from the date of payment of the CSF. If the County does not pay the amount by November 10 of the following year, MCHP may withhold the unpaid amount, plus interest as provided in this Section, from subsequent CSF payments due from MCHP under this Agreement. If the remaining CSF payments due from MCHP are less than the amount owed by the County to MCHP under this Section, the County shall pay the amount due to MCHP not later than December 15 of the year following the year in which the reduction occurs. An appeal of the assessed value does not defer the payment of the CSF. The CSF shall be paid as set out in paragraph 2 above. Any adjustments based on the outcome of the appeal shall be in accord with this paragraph. Page 9 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
5. Nonpayment of CSF. In compliance with ORS 307.123(b)(6), if MCHP fails to pay the CSF fee required by ORS 285B.386(4)(b), by the end of the tax year in which it is due, the tax exemption shall be revoked and the property shall be fully taxable for the following tax year for which the fee remains unpaid. It is agreed that MCHP shall pay the CSF for a total of seven years, and the property tax exemption will be revoked at the end of that seven year period. MCHP specifically agrees that it will not seek reinstatement of the property tax exemption by making CSF payments after the seven years contemplated by this agreement. B. FIRST SOURCE AGREEMENT. To target the County's unemployed and underemployed population and comply with the requirements of ORS 285B.383(3), MCHP shall enter into an Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement (FSA), with the Multnomah County or its designated contact agency(s) as defined in OAR 123-070-1100 . An executed copy of the FSA is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. Except as specifically provided in the FSA, MCHP's obligations under the FSA shall commence on July 1, 2003, the beginning of the County fiscal year in which MCHP first receives an SIP exemption. IV. ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF MCHP TO MEET COUNTY SIP STANDARDS AND GOALS. In consideration of the County's and City's actions to approve a SIP exemption for the Project, MCHP agrees to fill the role of an exemplary corporate citizen in Multnomah County as provided in this Agreement. Such a citizen helps prepare the unemployed and underemployed, including the emerging workforce from local high schools, community colleges, and universities, for entry level jobs which provide career paths, family wages, and excellent benefits, including childcare referrals and negotiations of group rates, which help assure the success of the employee in those jobs. An exemplary corporate citizen also leads the business community by progressing toward a goal to have no negative impact on the environment through state-of-the-art transportation and environmental programs. And, an exemplary corporate citizen positively affects the educational and economic well-being of the community in which it resides by directing its efforts and resources to the benefit of its community's citizens and businesses. By meeting the performance requirements specified in this Agreement, MCHP will meet its responsibilities as an exemplary corporate citizen. A. HIRING, WAGES, BENEFITS, TRAINING AND RETENTION. COUNTY GOALS: TO CREATE LONG TERM JOBS WITH FAMILY WAGES, BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS OR CREATION OF A FULL SPECTRUM OF JOBS FOR RESIDENTS OF MULTNOMAH COUNTY WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED, WITH A CLEAR CAREER TRACK FROM ENTRY-LEVEL JOBS TO FAMILY WAGE JOBS. Page 10 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE UPWARD MOBILITY FOR BOTH TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT ROLES. TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTED ON-SITE JOBS THAT PAY LOW WAGES. MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THESE COUNTY GOALS AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THOSE GOALS: 1. Local Hiring. MCHP's goal is to hire many local candidates. MCHP intends to target as much as possible the workers who have been laid off by FMI for the open job opportunities MCHP will create. MCHP will focus on previous employees who have directly related semiconductor fabrication experience. Once MCHP has exhausted those rehiring possibilities, MCHP will work with the County to find more qualified candidates. 2. Retention of Existing Jobs and New Hires. a. Number of Jobs. MCHP currently projects that, at a minimum, the following jobs will be retained or created at the Project (totals refer to the total number of jobs at the Project including jobs retained and jobs created) in the following calendar years: The preceding table shows the minimum number of jobs which MCHP expects it will create at the Project. If economic conditions support investments in the Project at the level shown in Section II.A, it is expected that jobs at the Project will exceed the minimum number of jobs shown in the preceding table. MCHP will report all jobs at the Project in accordance with Section V. Page 11 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
b. Timing. MCHP shall create the total number of jobs at the Project set out in the preceding chart in each of the years shown in that chart. Each year's minimum number of jobs, as set out in the "Total" row of the chart shown above, shall be created by December 31 of the relevant year. A new job is "created" when someone is hired as a regular full-time employee. The number of employees may be deferred or reduced temporarily due to delays in commissioning equipment, inability of MCHP to recruit qualified employees, or economic circumstances, either in general or specific to MCHP, leading to a requirement for a deferral in recruitment or a reduction in employment. If such a deferral or reduction is necessary, MCHP shall notify the County in writing, specifying the reason for the deferral or reduction, the amount of the deferral or reduction, and the expected duration of the circumstances giving rise to the deferral or reduction. If the County believes that MCHP has deferred or reduced maintaining and creating jobs in violation of this Agreement, the County may commence dispute resolution proceedings under Section VII.A of this Agreement. c. Additional Employment. Total Project employees may be greater than those indicated in Section IV.A.2.a. While MCHP cannot commit to increases, the commitment to the Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement attached as Exhibit A of this Agreement shall apply throughout the term of this Agreement. 3. Temporary Employees. MCHP anticipates it will use temporary employees in production tasks only to meet peak production loads and to cover temporary and extended leaves of absence. A Category One temporary employee, as defined in paragraph 5, below, shall not hold a position longer than six months unless the employee is filling a vacancy created by extended medical leave or a statutorily protected leave. 4. Retention of Employees. MCHP intends to hire and retain these employees for many years, and to provide its employees with multiple opportunities to move progressively through the MCHP corporate organization with increasing responsibility. To carry out these intentions, MCHP shall maintain during the term of this Agreement a transfer policy and an internal posting policy which are substantially similar to the transfer policy and internal posting policy which are attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement. Page 12 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
It is the intent of the parties that employees hired in new jobs be retained either in the initial position or in progressively more responsible positions within MCHP. Beginning with the end of fiscal year 2003-04, MCHP shall demonstrate that at least 70% of all of its regular full time employees at the Gresham facilities except those described in the next sentence are retained for at least two years. The following employees will not be counted: 1) those terminated for cause; and (2) those who voluntarily terminate employment other than for reasons of inadequacy of child care, transportation or housing. 5. Advancement of Category One Employees. MCHP will source as many Category One Employees as practicable for hire into entry-level production operator jobs. MCHP currently provides a weeklong training class for all production operators. In addition, MCHP continually offers in-house training and certification levels to improve performance and employee output. MCHP shall maintain these programs or substantially similar programs during the term of this Agreement. "Category One Employee" means a person holding a job which requires less than a two year college degree or certificate and which is not highly technical in nature. In addition, MCHP shall: a. offer supervisors of Category One Employees substantial training in dealing with employee issues, including workplace diversity. b. maintain its current, multi-step disciplinary process, or a substantially similar process, in place to ensure all employees are given multiple opportunities to improve their performance as well as to receive guidance on any particular employee issues. MCHP's current Employee Performance Improvement Plan , which details MCHP's multi-step process for employee discipline, is attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement. c. maintain its current policy of referring employees to multiple avenues for guidance, including but not limited to access to an employee assistance program which provides counseling. MCHP's current open door policy, which refers employees to several avenues for guidance, it attached as Exhibit D to this Agreement. 6. Promotional Practices. Microchip's practice is to promote approximately 10% of the indirect labor force once per year to the next grade level responsibility. Approximately 40% of the new Gresham facilities will be direct labor employees. Once Microchip places an entry level or category one direct labor employee into grade 90, the following chart illustrates their path. Page 13 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
90---92 -First year promotion 92---94 -Second year promotion 94---96 -Third year promotion Once a Category One employee has reached grade 96 they have had a promotion every year for three years and they have reached the highest grade available. To continue advancement an employee must take on additional responsibilities such as supervision or follow a technical path toward engineering. Microchip provides tuition reimbursement as described in Exhibit G up to $10,000 a year for education. Microchip commits to continue with this level of promotions per year to the extent economic conditions permit, for all employees whose job performance justifies promotion. "Direct labor" refers to anyone who touches the product or works on the wafer process. Direct labor positions are classified as "production specialists" whose costs are included in MCHP's cost per wafer analysis. "Indirect labor" refers to any labor positions except "direct labor." 7. Wages. MCHP represents that its current wage structure, including base pay, bonus and stock option grants, are competitive with current industry standards. MCHP will continue to maintain competitive wages, and to compare its wages to the Radford Benchmark Survey annually, or its equivalent. A chart showing wages, benefits, shift differential, and overtime is attached as Exhibit H. MCHP commits to reviewing the Radford Benchmark and making any changes to salary ranges that apply, provided that economic conditions allow for such increases in salary ranges. 8. Employer Paid Benefits. a. In General. MCHP intends to fulfill its role as an exemplary corporate citizen by providing an attractive and competitive benefits package which enables MCHP to recruit and retain qualified employees. MCHP acknowledges that provision of excellent, competitive benefits is vital, not only to achieving MCHP's corporate objectives, but also to achieve the County's goals. b. Specific Benefits. MCHP currently provides all existing US employees at other locations with the benefits described in Exhibit E attached to this Agreement. Page 14 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
During the period of property tax exemption, MCHP may have to modify its benefits package in order to maintain costs in response to industry or economic conditions or to remain competitive. The cost to MCHP's employees is the same for all employees regardless of job title or income level. Employees may choose to insure only themselves, employee plus spouse or employee plus family. Also included in the attached as Exhibit E is a cost analysis for benefit cost for the benefit plan year of May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2003. MCHP shall report the benefits it provides for employees at the Project, and, prior to making any substantial reductions in MCHP's aggregate benefits package, MCHP shall provide reasonable notice to the County. During the period of the property tax exemption, MCHP shall provide health insurance at least comparable to that provided under the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). 9. Child Care. MCHP will work in good faith to attempt partnership relationships with local childcare facilities to provide discounts for MCHP employees. MCHP will provide a link to Oregon childcare commission website (http://findit.emp.state.or.us/occc/) on its internal website to facilitate employee access to childcare information. B. TRANSPORTATION. COUNTY GOAL: TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO USE TRANSIT, CARPOOLS, VANPOOLS, OR ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THIS COUNTY GOAL AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS GOAL: MCHP shall encourage use of alternative modes of transportation by maintaining its current Trip Reduction Program, or a substantially similar program. MCHP's current Trip Reduction Program is described in Exhibit F attached to this Agreement. C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC SERVICES. COUNTY GOAL: TO ELIMINATE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED TO EXISTING RESIDENTS OF MULTNOMAH COUNTY AND THE REGION. Page 15 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THIS COUNTY GOAL AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THAT GOAL: MCHP shall comply with all material provisions generally applicable under City, County and State of Oregon development requirements to mitigate adverse impacts on the level of services to existing residents of the County and City that involve transportation and utility infrastructure and public safety. D. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. COUNTY GOAL: TO APPROVE TAX ABATEMENTS ONLY FOR FIRMS THAT DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THIS COUNTY GOAL AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THAT GOAL: To demonstrate its commitment to environmental protection: 1. MCHP shall identify by June 30, 2004, baseline conditions associated with full production in each of the following categories: (1) toxic and hazardous materials; (2) water conservation, reuse and waste water discharge; (3) air quality; (4) waste reduction and recycling; and (5) energy conservation. Additionally, MCHP will create an evaluation matrix to measure its progress toward the County's goal and shall strive to make progress toward that goal. 2. MCHP shall carefully evaluate participation in DEQ's Green Permits program and EPA's Performance Track program. Multnomah County agrees that successful application and participation by MCHP in the Green Permits program or EPA Performance Track program will constitute achievement of the County goal, however, other appropriate measures can also contribute to meeting the goal. MCHP shall make its determination regarding an application for the Green Permits or Performance Track programs by August 1, 2003. At this time, should MCHP decline to make application, MCHP will notify the County in writing, identifying the reasons for MCHP's decision and specifying alternative measures and pollution prevention or environmental management programs that MCHP will promptly pursue and implement to further the County's environmental protection goal. 3. If any person is determined by the appropriate environmental authority to have violated an applicable environmental law, MCHP shall cure or cause to be cured the damage in accordance with and as required by applicable laws to the reasonable satisfaction of the reviewing environmental authority. Page 16 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
E. JOB TRAINING. COUNTY GOALS: TO BUILD A WORLD-CLASS WORKFORCE THAT PROVIDES THE FULL RANGE OF SKILLS NECESSARY TO ATTRACT AND SUSTAIN COMPETITIVE, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPANIES. TO GRADUATE ALL CHILDREN FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH SKILLS ENABLING THEM TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKFORCE AND/OR IN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION, INCLUDING THE FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY TO READ, WRITE, COMMUNICATE AND REASON. TO ESTABLISH STRONGER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BEYOND THE SECONDARY LEVEL TO MEET THE REGION'S NEEDS FOR ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION, EXPANDED GRADUATE PROGRAMS, HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE UPWARD MOBILITY FOR BOTH TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT ROLES. MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THESE COUNTY GOALS AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THOSE GOALS: 1. MCHP shall work in good faith with the education community to support curriculum and career path options for obtaining jobs in the semiconductor field. This good-faith effort includes but is not limited to: (a) Assisting in the successful realization of the Center for Advanced Learning by serving on the C.A.L industry advisory committee; providing assistance and expertise with curriculum development, instructional assistance, development of internships and mentoring opportunities; consideration of financial and equipment donations to the C.A.L. (b) Working with MHCC and local high schools (Gresham, Sam Barlow, Reynolds, Centennial, Parkrose, David Douglas, and Marshall) to explore partnership opportunities including but not limited to: internships and mentoring programs, curriculum development, instructional assistance, scholarships, financial and equipment donations. (c) Designating a representative to serve on the Board of Directors of the Mt. Hood Community College Foundation, when a position becomes available. Page 17 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
2. MCHP currently offers 40 hours of on site training to all newly hired operators at no cost to the employee. MCHP commits to utilizing the Mt. Hood Microelectronics Training Center for elements of employee training. MCHP and Mt. Hood Community College will confer and determine the appropriate employee training to be conducted at the Mt. Hood Microelectronics Training Center (MTC). Such determination shall be made by July 1, 2003. At this time MCHP shall designate a representative to serve on the MTC budget committee. Each firm which has a SIP agreement with the County that requires that firm to contribute to MTC on substantially the same basis as MCHP (a "SIP Firm") shall be entitled to have a member on the budget committee for MTC. The budget committee for MTC shall consist of one member appointed by the County, one by Mt. Hood Community College, and one by each SIP firm. a. The members of the Budget Committee shall approve a Training Center operating budget for each calendar year by majority vote. However, without the prior written consent of MCHP, the budget approved for annual operating costs shall not exceed $126,450, which is equal to 110% of the Training Center operating budget for 2001. b. After the budget is approved in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the funding for the budget for each calendar year shall be apportioned among the SIP Firms, based on the number of personnel each SIP firm had at its project as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year. The apportionment shall be based on a ratio of the personnel at the Project (as shown in the following schedule) to the total number of personnel scheduled to be at all SIP Firm's projects. The schedule of personnel for the Project shall be: Calendar Year ending Number of December 31 Personnel ----------- --------- 2003 204 2004 228 2005 256 2006 286 2007 321 2008 360 2009 401 This schedule of personnel shall be amended to reflect actual employment in the event that actual employment differs by more than twenty-five percent from the above numbers. Payment from each firm will be scheduled by the Budget Committee to coincide with the estimated need to pay costs of Mt. Hood Microelectronics Center related to education and training for the high technology industry. Page 18 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
In addition MCHP's tuition reimbursement policy, which is attached as Exhibit G, provides up to $10,000 per year reimbursement for classes and books to anyone who enrolls in classes at a certified university for job related classes or degree. 3. MCHP currently provides funds in departmental budgets to cover external training needs for employees to improve their skills. 4. MCHP currently maintains an extensive in house training department with an excellent portfolio of classes, see attached recent recognition from Training Magazine. MCHP will offer 15 training classes at the Project by July 1, 2003, and will increase training classes to include its full core curriculum as the Project reaches full production capacity. 5. MCHP shall continue to provide these educational programs, or substantially similar educations benefits for its employees. 6. MCHP agrees to evaluate the Fujitsu proprietary degree in good faith and allow its employees appropriate credit for having obtained that degree. F. PROCURE LOCALLY PRODUCED OR SOLD GOODS AND SERVICES COUNTY GOAL: TO ENCOURAGE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES PRODUCED OR SOLD BY BUSINESSES IN MULTNOMAH COUNTY AND THE REGION. MCHP ACKNOWLEDGES THIS COUNTY GOAL AND AGREES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS GOAL: 1. MCHP acknowledges this County goal and agrees to make best effort to purchase from local suppliers subject to MCHP's ability to find local suppliers whose products meet MCHP's specifications and quality standards, and whose products cost the same or lower that non-local goods and services. 2. MCHP will make good faith and reasonable efforts to procure for construction, installation and equipment maintenance services in a manner which recognizes and rewards responsible contractors based on the following factors: necessary technical qualifications (including licensure), past performance record (including safety, cost effectiveness, business location (per the local procurement goals of this Agreement) and other factors consistent with MCHP's stated mission, values, and record of operations. Page 19 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
V. MCHP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. A. MCHP TO REPORT CONTRACT COMPLIANCE TO COUNTY. 1. MCHP shall prepare and submit to County SIP Manager the quarterly and annual reports described in paragraphs 5 and 6 below. The annual report shall include the quarterly report information on the jobs information for the quarter ending June 30. No separate quarterly report is required for the quarter ending June 30. 2. MCHP, County and the City will work together to determine the form of report necessary to track benefits of the "targeted population," as that term is defined in the First Source Agreement. To the extent possible, data compilations generated and used by MCHP in the ordinary conduct of its operations will be used for the report to the County. 3. The reports are to be sent to the following address: Duke Shepard Multnomah County Chair's Office 501 SE Hawthorne Blvd. 6th floor Portland, OR 97293-0700 4. Confidentiality of Reports. MCHP proprietary information contained in the reports and documents submitted by MCHP to the County in support of the report is, and shall be, submitted in complete confidence. County shall treat MCHP's proprietary information in a confidential manner. The parties agree that any such proprietary information is exempt from public disclosure under, and the County agrees to assert in connection with any public records request that, such information is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law, ORS 192.502(4). This Agreement is MCHP's written request for confidentiality and is the County's assurance that it will treat MCHP's documents as confidential. The County acknowledges that MCHP documents that contain proprietary information may give competitors an undue advantage, and, therefore, that such documents are also entitled to nondisclosure protection under ORS 192.501(2). Additionally, employee survey information of a private nature is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(2) and 192.501(5). MCHP understands and agrees that the County may, subject to the foregoing confidentiality obligations imposed upon the County, send portions of the reports to other Oregon governmental entities for review to ensure compliance with this Agreement. For example, the portion of the report on compliance with the County's environmental goals may be sent to DEQ for review. The confidentiality of the MCHP documents shall extend to such documents in the hands of all other governmental agencies and the County shall advise the other governmental agencies of the confidentiality obligation when submitting MCHP Page 20 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
documents to such other governmental entities. ORS 192.502(9) contemplates continued confidentiality for documents transferred by a public body to another public body. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MCHP shall not be required to report information to the County in a manner which violates the privacy rights of MCHP's employees. If the County discloses any information provided by MCHP to the County pursuant to this Agreement in any manner which violates the rights of any person or entity, the County shall indemnify and hold MCHP and its agents, directors, officers or employees harmless from and against any claim made against MCHP or its agents, directors, officers or employees based on the disclosure of that information by the County, including costs of attorneys' fees at trial and on appeal. 5. Quarterly Reports on Job Creation, Compensation and Retention.

Page 22 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
B. COOPERATION WITH OREGON DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. MCHP and the County shall cooperate with the Oregon Department of Revenue to identify the property that receives the property tax exemption as described in this Agreement. VI. OBLIGATIONS OF COUNTY AND CITY. A. FINDINGS. In consideration of the actions of MCHP as described in this Agreement, the County and the City find that: 1. Granting an SIP exemption for the Project will foster the economic growth and legislative policy as set forth in ORS 285.310. 2. The Project will be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. 3. The operation of the Project in the County and the City would be in the best interest of the citizens of Multnomah County and the City of Gresham. B. THE COUNTY AND CITY AGREE AS FOLLOWS: 1. Approval of Provisions Related to Property Tax Exemption. The County and the City approve the provisions of this Agreement related to the SIP exemption by execution of this Agreement. The County agrees to approve the application of MCHP and request the undertaking of the Project as an "eligible project" by official action of its governing body in compliance with ORS 285B.386(1). 2. Property Tax Exemption. Upon approval by of the Project as an "eligible project" by the Oregon Economic and Community Development Commission, the Project shall be subject to assessment and taxation as provided in ORS 307.123 beginning in fiscal year 2003-2004. VII. BREACH; DEFAULT; REMEDIES OF THE COUNTY. A. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE. 1. Multnomah County's designated SIP Manager shall have the duty to monitor compliance by MCHP with the terms of this Agreement. 2. If either County or the City has substantial evidence to believe that MCHP has failed materially to comply with any term of this Agreement and that such failure is not excused, County and the City shall confer, and shall involve persons in their Page 23 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
organizations whose job responsibilities relate to the noncompliance. County shall show the evidence of noncompliance to these representatives. If, after they examine the evidence, County continues to believe that MCHP has failed materially to comply with one or more terms of this Agreement and the failure is not excused, County shall notify MCHP of this belief and the basis therefor. In any event, MCHP shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with this Agreement if the failure is caused by a FORCE MAJEURE, as provided under Section VII.B, below, or if the alleged failure is a variance from numerically ascertainable terms which is described in Section VII.E. 3. Notice required by Section VII.A.2 shall be in writing and shall be sent to MCHP at the following addresses, both of which shall be required for notice to be effective: Microchip Technology Incorporated 2355 West Chandler Blvd. Chandler, Arizona 85224-6199 Attention: Steve Sanghi, President and CEO With a copy to: Mary K. Simmons, General Counsel If MCHP wishes to change the address(es) to which notice hereunder shall be given, it may do so by providing written notice to the County at the address indicated in Section V.A.3. 4. Upon receipt of the notice described in Section VII.A.2, MCHP shall have 45 days to respond in writing. MCHP's written response shall be delivered to County at the address shown in Section V.A.3. MCHP's response shall include such supporting documentation as is related to the issues raised by the notice described in Section VII.A.2 and that is within MCHP's control to provide for the sole purpose of allowing the County to substantiate MCHP's response. The County shall have 45 days in which to review and consider MCHP's response and to notify MCHP in writing if the County believes MCHP is not in compliance, and to state the basis for the County's belief. If the County does not give MCHP such written notice within 45 days, the matter shall be deemed closed. 5. If the County notifies MCHP pursuant to Section VI.A.4 that the County continues to believe that a failure of performance by MCHP has occurred, the parties will meet as soon as possible and confer with the objective that the issues upon which there is dispute are clearly defined and understood and that any misunderstanding of the essential factors of the dispute may be resolved. The County may retain an outside consultant, or the County Auditor may be used to verify MCHP's compliance. In the course of this process, if physical access to the Project premises is required, MCHP will allow the County or its designated consultant or Auditor such access at reasonable times and under conditions that will comply with MCHP's customary rules and procedures pertaining to safety, Page 24 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
property security, confidentiality, engineering, and intellectual property protection and so as to not interfere with MCHP's operations of the Project. The parties shall also exercise their respective best efforts to resolve all disputed issues, in a manner and result that is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. A resolution so reached shall be documented in a written Compliance Agreement to the parties' mutual satisfaction. 6. If, following such efforts by the parties to amicably resolve their differences, a mutually satisfactory outcome is not achieved, the procedures in the order set forth below shall be followed: a. Subject to subsection b, below, senior management of both parties shall first mutually negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute that arises between them. If such negotiations are unsuccessful the parties agree that, before any litigation can be initiated, except as provided in b, below, the dispute shall be submitted to non-binding mediation in front of a mediator who is an attorney who is both knowledgeable in the laws which govern this agreement and who has substantial experience in the semiconductor or electronics manufacturing industries, or a mutually acceptable person of comparable expertise and competence. Such mediation shall take place within 90 days' of a party's receipt of a request therefore, in a neutral location mutually acceptable to both parties. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own costs and expenses (including legal fees, if necessary) for the mediation. In the event that the mediation is unsuccessful, either party may initiate litigation to address the dispute. b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute in which specific performance or injunctive relief is sought need not be submitted to mediation, but may instead be immediately brought by the aggrieved party to an appropriate court. c. The prevailing party in any litigation proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, to reimbursement for its expenses incurred in such action, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs. 7. Breach. a. A "Breach" shall be deemed to have occurred if: (1) before or after mediation, MCHP acknowledges that is has failed to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (unless the parties have agreed that the failure to comply is not a Breach); or Page 25 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
(2) a court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that MCHP has failed to comply with it obligations under this Agreement. b. MCHP shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with this Agreement if the failure is caused by a FORCE MAJEURE, as provided under Section VII.B, or if the alleged failure is a variance from numerically ascertainable terms which is described in Section VII.E c. Where this Agreement imposes an obligation on MCHP to act "in good faith," no Breach shall be deemed to occur unless the parties agree or a court determines in a final nonappealable judgment that MCHP failed to take any reasonable action to comply with that obligation, or that MCHP acted in bad faith. B. FORCE MAJEURE. If by reason of FORCE MAJEURE, MCHP is unable in whole or in part to carry out any of its obligations in this Agreement, other than obligations for the payment of money, a Breach shall not be deemed to occur during the continuance of such inability. The term "FORCE MAJEURE" as used herein shall mean, without limitation, any of the following: acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances; acts of the public enemy; orders or restraints of any kind of the government of the United States of America or of the state wherein the County is located or any of their departments, agencies or officials, or any civil or military authority; insurrections; riots; landslides; earthquakes; volcanic eruption; fires; storms; droughts; floods; explosions; breakage or accident to machinery, transmission pipes or canals; or any similar or different cause or event not reasonably within the control of the MCHP. FORCE MAJEURE also includes any significant reduction in market demand for the products that are produced at the Project which makes it economically infeasible for MCHP to operate the Project in compliance with this Agreement. To excuse performance of any obligation of MCHP due to a FORCE MAJEURE, MCHP must notify the County as soon as reasonably possible after the FORCE MAJEURE has occurred and MCHP has had an opportunity to determine the effect of the FORCE MAJEURE upon MCHP's business and its obligations hereunder. The notice shall state the nature of the occurrence, the anticipated effect of the occurrence on MCHP's obligations, and when MCHP will be able to resume compliance with this Agreement. If the County, following consultation with the City, does not agree that MCHP shall be excused from performance in the manner stated in MCHP's notice, the County shall notify MCHP within 90 days and the parties shall commence dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Section VII.A. C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH NUMERICALLY ASCERTAINABLE TERMS. It is the intent of the parties that good faith efforts will be made to comply with all the terms of this Agreement. However, in such a large Project, it is difficult to anticipate all contingencies with accuracy. In a spirit of fairness and recognizing the cyclical vagaries of business, the County and City agree that variance from numerically ascertainable Page 26 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
terms of this Agreement by a plus or minus 5% will not constitute a failure of MCHP to comply with this Agreement. However, the variance is not cumulative. D. SANCTIONS. The following sanctions shall apply if a Breach occurs: 1. Failure to Pay. If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to pay the CSF or any other fee MCHP is required to pay to the County under this Agreement, the County shall be entitled to the amount of the delinquency, plus the following penalties (subject to the following paragraph): (1) if the payment is made more than ten (10) business days after the payment is due and written demand has been made to MCHP for payment, the County shall be entitled to receive a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the delinquent amount; and, (2) if the payment is made more than 45 business days after the payment is due and written demand has been made to MCHP for payment, the County shall be entitled to receive a penalty of one hundred percent (100%) of the delinquent amount. If MCHP reasonably disputes the amount or timing of any payment which is alleged by the County to be due to the County under this Agreement, MCHP may tender the amount which is alleged to be due and thereby prevent any penalties from accruing, and may continue its dispute. Payment by MCHP shall not constitute a waiver by MCHP of any matter in dispute. If the dispute is resolved in favor of MCHP, the County shall refund the amount of overpayment to MCHP, with interest, within 30 days after the dispute is resolved. 2. Failure to Create and Retain Jobs. If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to meet the job creation or job retention requirements of Section IV.A.2.a of this Agreement, MCHP shall pay an amount equal to twice the average gross annual salary plus benefits for operators and technicians in the year of the breach for every job not created or job not retained. 3. Failure to Use FSA. If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to notify the County in accordance with the FSA of MCHP hiring needs for covered positions, or to hire qualified applicants for covered positions in accordance with the FSA, MCHP shall pay to the County an amount equal to twice the average gross annual salary plus benefits for operators and technicians in the year of the breach for every person who would have been hired though the FSA, but was not so hired because of MCHP's failure. If MCHP fails to act in good faith to meet its obligations under the FSA, and the failure results in effective abandonment of the FSA by MCHP, MCHP shall pay Page 27 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
75 percent of the Property Tax Abatement for each year the abandonment continues. It shall not constitute an abandonment if MCHP's failure is due to nonperformance by the County of its obligations under the FSA. 4. Failure to Meet Reporting Requirements. If MCHP fails to meet reporting requirements of Section V of this Agreement, MCHP shall pay twice the amount necessary to have an auditor investigate and prepare the report, or any portion thereof which has been omitted. 5. Environmental Crimes. If MCHP is found to be responsible by a competent court in a final nonappealable judgment for conduct at the Project which constitutes felony criminal conduct under federal, state or local environmental law, MCHP shall pay seventy five percent of the tax abatement for the tax year in which the conduct is found to have occurred. 6. Failure to meet Other Requirements. In the event a sanction for a Breach is not specified in the preceding paragraphs of this Section VII.D, MCHP shall pay to the County an amount equal to any benefit MCHP realized from the Breach, plus a 100% penalty (i.e. the total payment due is two times what MCHP should have spent to comply with the agreement). E. LIMITATIONS. 1. No Breach shall be deemed to occur and no sanction shall be imposed in connection with any action taken by MCHP during any tax year in which MCHP has paid ad valorem property taxes on the full market value of the Project. 2. No sanction or combination of sanctions shall exceed 75% of the total tax abatement for any single tax year. A tax year begins on July 1 and ends on the following June 30. F. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS PAID BY MCHP FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENT. Any funds collected under Sections VII.D above, shall be paid to the County Finance Manager and held in a segregated fund. The funds shall be distributed by the Board of County Commissioners to a program or project in the area of public policy most directly related to the failure to comply. VIII. REMEDIES OF MCHP. If the City or County breaches this Agreement, MCHP shall be entitled to exercise any of its legal or equitable remedies, either through the dispute resolution process set forth in Section VI A or through administrative or judicial processes. Page 28 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
IX. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall take effect on the date the Oregon Economic and Community Development Commission formally determines that the Project is an "eligible project" which will receive the partial property tax exemption described in ORS 307.123 and a deed is recorded conveying the existing FMI facilities to MCHP, and shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in this Section IX. This Agreement shall terminate on June 30, 2010. However, termination of this Agreement shall not affect the obligation of any party to pay amounts which were due under this Agreement for the period prior to its date of termination. X. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS. A. DISCRIMINATION. No persons shall be denied or subject to discrimination in receipt of the benefits of any services or activities made possible by or resulting from the Agreement on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, creed, marital status, age, national origin, mental health or physical handicap, disabled or Vietnam era veteran status (except where there are bona fide occupational qualifications). Any violation of this provision shall be considered a material violation of the Agreement. B. PUBLIC CONTRACTS. All applicable requirements of the Oregon Revised Statutes Nos. 279.120 through 279.333 are incorporated herein by reference. This provision is intended to incorporate only those provisions which are required for all public contracts. The parties acknowledge that: other portions of ORS Chapter 279 do not apply; this Agreement is not one for a public improvement or public work; and the wages and other compensation paid by MCHP to its employees is not subject to ORS 279.348 through 279.365. C. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Oregon. Any actions or suits commenced in connection with this Agreement shall be in Circuit Court of Multnomah County or Federal District Court for Oregon. D. COMPLETE AGREEMENT.

No modifications of the Agreement will be binding on any party except as a written addendum signed by authorized agents of each party. MCHP's policies, some of which are exhibits to this Agreement, may be changed by MCHP at any time without consent of, or notice to, the Page 29 of 31, Execution Copy of August 15, 2002
County or the City, and changes to those policies shall not be deemed an amendment of this Agreement. All rights and remedies of each party shall be cumulative and may be exercised successively or concurrently. The foregoing is without limitation to or waiver of any other rights or remedies of either party according to law. E. CSF PAYMENTS NOT PROPERTY TAXES. The parties acknowledge that any payments required under this Agreement do not constitute property taxes and are not subject to the limits under Section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. F. COMPLIANCE RELEVANT TO FUTURE APPROVALS. MCHP acknowledges that its compliance with this Agreement will be an important consideration for local government approval of any future applications MCHP may make seeking property tax exemptions for other Projects. G. LEASE OR SUBLEASE OF THE PREMISES. While it is not contemplated that MCHP will lease or sublease the premises, if that were to occur, the property tax exemption may transfer under the provisions of ORS 285B.383(4) and ORS 307.123. H. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind the successors and assigns of the parties. I. GOOD FAITH CONTESTS PERMITTED. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as: (1) preventing MCHP from contesting in good faith any tax, assessment or other fee imposed by the County or any other governmental entity; or (2) granting rights to any employee of MCHP. The obligations of MCHP in this Agreement are for the benefit of the County and the City, and for the general benefit of their citizens; no individual or entity not a party to this Agreement shall be treated as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. J. VALIDITY OF COUNTY OBLIGATIONS.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [LOGO] NEWS RELEASE MICROCHIP INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT: Gordon Parnell - CFO ... (480) 792-7374 MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY COMMENTS ON FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER 2003; ANNOUNCES CONSOLIDATION OF FABS 1 AND 2 CHANDLER, Arizona - April 7, 2003 -- (NASDAQ:MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, announced today that net sales and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 ended March 31, 2003 are expected to be lower than its previous guidance. Net sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately $159 to $160 million. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately $0.16, up approximately three cents, or approximately 28%, from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Microchip expects to release its March quarter and audited fiscal 2003 results after the close of market on Wednesday, April 23, 2003. "Since our March 18 Business Update, we have continued to see a sharp drop off in business, which we attribute to the impact of the war in Iraq. At the time of our Business Update, we had approximately 95% of the quarter booked, and we expected to achieve the remaining turns in the balance of the quarter. However, customers continued to delay purchasing decisions, which we attribute to lingering concerns about demand for their end products in light of the war and continued economic weakness. Additionally, the spread throughout Asia of SARS, an acute respiratory illness, is inhibiting business travel and, in some cases, purchasing decisions, as many customers are temporarily closing plants to avoid the spread of the disease. Therefore, we are lowering our estimates for net sales and earnings per share for the fourth quarter," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. The Company also announced its intention to combine the operations of its Fab 1 (Chandler, AZ) and Fab 2 (Tempe, AZ) into its Fab 2 clean room space. Over the next few months, Microchip will transfer Fab 1 processes and products to Fab 2. After that, Fab 1 will cease operations as a wafer fabrication facility. The newly defined Fab 2 will be staffed with combined personnel from both Fab 1 and Fab 2. -- MORE --

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY COMMENTS ON FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2003 Microchip will also offer certain personnel from Fabs 1 and 2 the opportunity to relocate to Gresham, Oregon to staff Fab 4 which is scheduled for production commencing in October 2003. It is currently expected that the combination of Fabs 1 and 2 will result in a reduction in force of approximately 140 employees. Microchip will incur restructuring charges related to the shut down of Fab 1. These charges will consist primarily of costs associated with the planned discontinued use of various Fab 1 assets and salary continuation costs related to the anticipated reduction in force. We expect the restructuring charges will be taken in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 ending June 30, 2003, and are currently expected to be between $27 and $33 million. "Fab 1 is our oldest manufacturing facility and utilizes our least advanced process technologies. In this market environment, demand for products using our older technologies is weakest and, thus, it is prudent to combine the Fab 1 and 2 activities into Fab 2," said Mr. Sanghi. "However, demand for products using our advanced technology continues to increase, and this demand will require us to commence production at Fab 4 in the October 2003 timeframe. We believe our decision to combine Fabs 1 and 2 will enable us to preserve our gross margins at approximately 54% after the combination is complete and we expect our gross margins to improve once Fab 4 is in production. The combined capacity of Fabs 2 and 4 will provide sufficient wafer fabrication capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand," added Mr. Sanghi. "We are very disappointed with the dramatic effect of world events and the resulting economic uncertainty on our business in the fourth quarter. Despite this, we are maintaining our long-term strategy and product development initiatives. We shipped a record of over 10,500 new development systems in the fourth quarter, up from approximately 6,500 in the immediately preceding third quarter. In fiscal 2003, we shipped a total of 35,000 development systems, an increase of approximately 50% over fiscal 2002. We believe the increase in shipments of development systems demonstrates the continuing solid momentum of our design win success. Our customer base for Analog products continues to expand. We are now sampling our Digital Signal Controller product line to our early adopter customers and are pleased with the very strong reception," concluded Mr. Sanghi. -- MORE --

EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE [LOGO] MICROCHIP INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT: Gordon Parnell - CFO ... (480) 792-7374 MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS * FY03 NET SALES UP 14% OVER FY02 * FY03 PRO FORMA NET INCOME UP 41% OVER FY02 CHANDLER, Arizona - April 23, 2003 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $159.7 million, down 5% sequentially from $167.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 7% from sales of $148.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter was $33.0 million or 16 cents per diluted share, down 9% sequentially from net income of $36.4 million or 17 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 25% from net income of $26.3 million or 13 cents per diluted share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 were $651.5 million, an increase of 14% from net sales of $571.3 million in the prior fiscal year. On a pro forma basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was $133.9 million, or 64 cents per diluted share, an increase of 41% from net income of $94.8 million, or 45 cents per diluted share in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was $88.2 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, a decrease of 7% from net income of $94.8 million, or 45 cents per diluted share in the prior year. Pro forma diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2003 exclude the effects of the Fab 3 (Puyallup, WA) impairment charge, an in process research and development charge (related to the acquisition of PowerSmart) and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to the Company's revenue recognition policy associated with sales to regional Asian distributors. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP results to its pro forma results is included later in this press release. On March 18, 2003, Microchip announced a change in its revenue recognition policy relating to sales to regional Asian distributors. Microchip changed from recognizing revenue when product is shipped to these distributors (Point of Purchase "POP") to recognizing revenue when these distributors sell the -- MORE --
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS product to their customers (Point of Sale "POS"). Historically, Microchip has recognized revenue from its Americas, European and multinational Asian distributors at POS, but has recognized revenue from regional Asian distributors at POP. The focus on demand creation and sell-through to end customers is in the long-term best interest of Microchip. Revenue recognition at POS as Microchip's sole revenue recognition policy is a more reflective measure of end customer demand. Instituting this change at this point will result in a revenue recognition policy that is uniform throughout the Company. To implement the change in revenue recognition, Microchip has recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $11.4 million as of April 1, 2002, which was the beginning of fiscal year 2003. This represents the amount of income that is now deferred as of that date under the POS method. Quarterly operating results for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2003 have been adjusted to conform to this change in accounting policy. These adjustments resulted in a cumulative revenue reduction of $8.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2003, and a cumulative net income reduction of $2.4 million for the same period. The Company expects to declare a quarterly cash dividend within the next week. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, and has made two cash dividend payments of $.02 per share each. "Microchip's performance in a very difficult environment reflects the hard work, determination and commitment of our global enterprise. In fiscal year 2003, we delivered year over year revenue growth of 14%, achieved substantial market share gains in the 8-bit microcontroller market, attained operating profits among the highest in the industry, and maintained a healthy, debt-free balance sheet. While the year did not finish as we anticipated, our fiscal year 2003 achievements validate that our business model is working solidly. Looking ahead, our business is expected to generate between $175 and $200 million in free cash flows in fiscal year 2004, confirming the overall continued strength of our business enterprise," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "As announced in our April 7, 2003 press release, we are focusing on the closure of Fab 1 (Chandler, AZ) and integrating certain personnel, equipment and processes into our Fab 2 (Tempe, AZ)," Mr. Sanghi continued. "After the completion of the integration process, our gross margins are expected to be approximately 54%, with further improvement anticipated after Fab 4 commences production. "Visibility in the current global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be very difficult. Despite the current uncertainties, we remain confident in the long-term performance of our proprietary microcontroller and analog products," Mr. Sanghi concluded. -- MORE --
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS MICROCHIP'S FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: * Microchip announced initial high yields from its Fab 4 semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon. All of the necessary manufacturing processes are working, the qualification wafers are in progress and the first wafers produced yielded 91% usable die. * Expanding its industry-leading power-managed portfolio, Microchip debuted seven PIC16F Flash microcontrollers that feature NANOWATT TECHNOLOGY. These devices offer the flexibility of reprogrammable Flash memory coupled with new power-managed features and are designed to reduce the overall power consumption within embedded systems. * Microchip introduced a highly flexible PICmicro(R) microcontroller family that helps simplify motor-control design.

Q1 FY2004 OUTLOOK: The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Continuing uncertainty in the global semiconductor industry and low visibility make it very difficult to predict demand and other related matters. Microchip will provide a mid-quarter update on June 10, 2003. See "Conference Call and Updates" section below for details. As indicated below, certain of the Q1 FY2004 Outlook line items are pro forma and exclude the effect of accelerated depreciation due to the announced closure of Fab 1 and other related expenses. Microchip expects these charges will be taken in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, and are currently expected to be between $27 and $33 million, for which Microchip estimates $24 to $29 million will represent accelerated depreciation, and $3 to $4 million will be other related expenses. The majority of the total charges will be reflected in cost of sales. * Net sales for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 is currently anticipated to be between $157 and $164 million (down approximately 2% to up approximately 3% compared to the immediately preceding quarter). -- MORE --
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS * Pro forma gross margins for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 are expected to be approximately 54%(1). Generally, gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold, manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, wafer fab loading levels, pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines, and competitive and economic conditions. * Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 are expected to be between $44.2 and $44.7 million. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and profit levels. * The pro forma tax rate for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 is anticipated to be approximately 25.5%.(2) * Pro forma earnings per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 are anticipated to be between 15 and 16 cents.(3) * Inventories at June 30, 2003 are anticipated to be approximately 141 days. The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization. * Capital expenditures for the quarter ending June 30, 2003 are expected to be approximately $15 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2004 are expected to total approximately $40 to $45 million. The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. * Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect to add approximately $50 million to our existing cash balances during the quarter ending June 30, 2003. * Microchip announced on August 7, 2002 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares. Microchip has been buying stock in the open market since that date. To date, 1,264,700 shares have been repurchased at a cost of $27.1 million. Future purchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations. - ---------- (1) GAAP gross margins for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 are expected to be between 35% and 39%. (2) GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 is expected to be between -17% and 8%.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS "The closure of Fab 1 and consolidation with Fab 2 was achieved flawlessly by our manufacturing team, establishing fab capacity levels that will reduce our future inventory levels. We closed the June quarter with 134 days of inventory, and anticipate being at the top end of our target range of 110 days by the end of the fiscal year," Mr. Sanghi continued. "From a market presence standpoint we were delighted to achieve our goal of reaching the number one position for 8-bit microcontroller shipments. The market share gains we achieved in calendar year 2002 reflect the strength of our brand name and the broad product offering that supports our customers," said Mr. Sanghi. "We anticipate improvement of our business model in the September quarter, with Asia and the Americas being our strongest geographies. We expect net sales to grow sequentially between 1 to 6% in the September quarter," Mr. Sanghi concluded. MICROCHIP'S FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 HIGHLIGHTS: o Microchip achieved the number one position in worldwide 8-bit microcontroller unit shipments, according to industry analyst Gartner Dataquest's recently released 2002 MICROCONTROLLER MARKET SHARE AND UNIT SHIPMENTS report++. From 2001 to 2002, unit sales for Microchip's PIC(R) microcontrollers grew 30 percent, despite challenging business conditions, enabling us to attain the number one ranking. o Microchip set a new quarterly record for shipments of development tools with 12,187 shipped. Sales were led by strong contributions from MPLAB(R) In Circuit Debugger (ICD) 2 and PICkit(TM) 1 Flash Starter Kit. Total cumulative development system shipments now stand at 274,181. o Microchip was named a finalist in the Best Sales Organization category for the American Business Awards. Nicknamed the Stevies(TM), The American Business Awards are the first national, all-encompassing business awards program honoring great performances in the workplace. o Microchip announced the PICDEM(TM) 4 Demonstration Board for the Company's low pin-count PIC(R) Flash microcontrollers, including the recently launched PIC16F and PIC18F microcontroller families - - MORE - -
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS that feature NANOWATT TECHNOLOGY. For $129, designers receive a demonstration tool that offers multiple socket options for increased flexibility and immediate programming and debugging. o Microchip introduced three microcontrollers with integrated transmitters and two receivers, which offers a complete system solution for short-range, uni-directional RF communication supporting frequency bands ranging from 260 - 930 MHz. By combining the rfPIC12F675 microcontroller/transmitters with either the rfRXD0420 receiver or rfRDX0920 receiver, users can easily create a wireless uni-directional communication link for embedded control applications, which can also be combined with the Company's existing rfPIC(TM) devices and KEELOQ(R) encoders to create remote sense and control applications. o At the April Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco, Microchip demonstrated the following products: the PS401/2 PowerSmart(R) Smart Battery System; its first Programmable Gain Amplifier (MCP6S2X); the fixed speed 9600-Baud Infrared Data Association(R)-Standard protocol stack controller (MCP2140); PIC16F microcontrollers featuring NANOWATT TECHNOLOGY; rfPIC transmitters/receivers; PICDEM(TM)4 Demonstration Board; Application Maestro(TM) Software; the MPLAB(R) In-Circuit Emulator (ICE) 4000; and the PICkit(TM) 1 Starter Kit. o The Company expanded its fan-speed control and fan-fault detection family, which features a proprietary fan auto-restart functionality that enables the device to continuously initiate a restart during a fan-fault condition. In addition to simplifying system design by eliminating the need for resetting the fan after a fan-fault condition occurs, the TC64xB devices also enable the user to set a minimum fan speed threshold (TC642B and TC647B) or an auto-shutdown threshold (TC646B, TC648B, and TC649B) to control fan operation when the operating temperature falls to lower levels. The TC642/6/8B devices assert an over-temperature signal to indicate a possible over-heating condition. o Microchip unveiled the low-cost PIC18FXX20 64- and 80-pin TQFP Demonstration Board, the Company's first demonstration board designed for its high pin-count PIC18F Flash microcontrollers. Fully functional right out of the box, the tool demonstrates the digital and analog peripherals of the PIC18FXX20 Flash microcontrollers, and allows for rapid and easy prototyping without the need to design a printed circuit board to support the included PIC18F8720 Flash microcontroller. - - MORE - -
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS o Expanding its popular PIC18F Flash family, Microchip introduced the PIC18F6520 and PIC18F8520 microcontrollers in 64- and 80-pin TQFP packages with a low-cost 32Kb memory device featuring Microchip's PMOS Electrically Erasable Cell (PEEC) process technology that provides best-in-class erase/write endurance, retention, and disturb reliability for both program and on-chip data EEPROM memory. These new devices are also code-compatible with Microchip's PIC18F452 and PIC18F8720 families of Flash devices, enabling designers to re-use software and hardware in existing platforms, thus lowering overall development costs and time-to-market issues. o Microchip revealed the TC1017 150mA low dropout regulator (LDO) in a tiny, space-saving SC-70 package. Designers can now replace SOT-23 LDOs with a 50 percent smaller footprint solution without compromising performance. The features of this new device improve system performance, reduce board space and minimize system cost, which makes the TC1017 one of the best SC-70 LDO choices for any battery-operated application. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 OUTLOOK: The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Continuing low visibility in the global semiconductor industry makes it very difficult to predict demand and other related matters. Microchip will make available a Mid-Quarter Update on September 16, 2003 after market close by posting the information on the Company's web site. The information will not be contained in a press release sent over the wire services, and will only be posted to the Company's web site at www.microchip.com. Those who do not have Internet access may call Microchip's Investor Relations Hotline at 480-792-7761 for a recorded summary of the Mid-Quarter Update. See "Conference Call and Updates" section below for details. o Net sales for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003 are currently anticipated to be between $163 and $171 million (up approximately 1% to 6% sequentially). o Gross margins for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003 are expected to be approximately 54%. Generally, gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of - - MORE - -
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. o Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003 are expected to be between $42.7 and $43.4 million. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and profit levels. o The tax rate for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003 is anticipated to be approximately 25.5%. o Earnings per diluted share for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003 are anticipated to be between 16 and 18 cents. o Inventories at September 30, 2003 are anticipated to be approximately 124 days. The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization. o Capital expenditures for the quarter ending September 30, 2003 are expected to be approximately $10 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2004 are expected to total approximately $40 to $45 million. The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. o Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect to add approximately $50 million to our existing cash balances during the quarter ending September 30, 2003, subject to stock repurchases, if any. o Microchip announced on August 7, 2002 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares. Microchip has been buying stock in the open market since that date. To date, 1,392,200 shares have been repurchased at a cost of $29.6 million. Future purchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations. - - MORE - -

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 16, 2003  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2003.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $168.5 million, up 4.5% sequentially from $161.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 1% from sales of $166.8 million in the prior year's second quarter.  Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $36.1 million or 17 cents per diluted share, up 7.8% from pro forma net income of $33.5 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 5.0% from pro forma net income of $34.4 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the prior year's second quarter.  GAAP net income of $36.1 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, was up 168% sequentially from GAAP net income of $13.5 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and up 280% from GAAP net income of $9.5 million, or 5 cents per diluted share in the same quarter a year ago.  A reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
The Company expects to declare a quarterly cash dividend within the next week.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and increased the cash dividend amount in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003.
 
"Sales and EPS were both at the high end of our expectations for the September quarter, sales in Asia and the Americas both exhibited excellent sequential growth, while Europe's performance reflected the anticipated summer holidays in that region," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.
 
"Sales of memory products were up over 12% sequentially, reflecting strong market conditions for those products.  We are seeing leadtimes on serial EEPROMs stretch out from certain competitors.  After nearly three years of very aggressive pricing pressure in the serial EEPROM market, we are selectively raising prices.  Analog sales grew by 6% sequentially, driven by our attach strategy with microcontrollers, and sales of microcontrollers grew approximately 3% sequentially in the quarter," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
"We continued to have strong cash generation in the quarter of approximately $78 million, and inventory fell by $4.5 million, with inventory days at 123, a drop of 11 days from the June quarter.  By the end of the December quarter, we expect inventory days to further improve and to be at the high end of our inventory target, at approximately 110 days.  This improved inventory position is expected to occur one quarter sooner than we previously planned," said Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon was qualified for production during the quarter, and is scheduled to begin production on October 31, 2003.  With our improved inventory position, we are planning to accelerate the Fab 4 ramp," said Mr. David Lambert, Microchip's Vice President of Fab Operations.
 
"Our book to bill ratio as of September was 1.04, and we are continuing to see strong demand characteristics in all areas of our business.  We are seeing an increase in activity of demand pull ins and requests to expedite from our customers and distributors because of very low inventory in the channel.  We have put the Company into upcycle dynamics and are prepared to meet the incremental demand of customers as well as distributor inventory rebuild.  We expect revenue growth in the current quarter of between 5 and 6 percent sequentially, in an otherwise seasonally weak quarter for Microchip," Mr. Sanghi concluded.

Reports Third Quarter
Fiscal Year 2004 Results
 
"Our business continued to strengthen during the quarter, achieving 5.6% net sales growth in a period that seasonally slows at the end of December in both the Americas and Europe.  This was the best December quarter sequential revenue growth the company achieved since December 1999.  Operating profits during the quarter were over 30%, and we generated $100 million in free cash, a record for Microchip.  We achieved record net sales of over $141 million in Microcontrollers, and also grew both the Memory and Analog product areas," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Visibility in all sectors of our business improved.  Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.26 overall, and was 1.10 in our direct business, resulting in the highest backlog we have seen since January 2001."
 
"Days of inventory declined from 123 days in September to 108 days in December.  We expect to continue to reduce our days of inventory over the next several quarters, as we indicated earlier," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory at our distributors grew for the first time in many quarters, but still remained at relatively low levels of approximately 2.2 months.  The majority of this growth was at our international distributors.  Many of our peers operate on a sell-in revenue recognition basis for these distributors.  If Microchip had reflected sales on this basis, our net sales would have grown by approximately an additional 4% over our reported results."
 
"Fab 4 in Gresham began production in late October as we had previously advised," said Mr. David Lambert, Microchip's Vice President of Fab Operations.  "I am extremely pleased with the performance of our facility during the December quarter.  The team has executed flawlessly, and productivity and yields have exceeded our initial expectations."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "As we look to the current quarter, our visibility has certainly improved, driven by the excellent book-to-bill ratio I mentioned earlier.  However, the March quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter, influenced by the Lunar/Chinese New Year.  Asia is our largest geography, and the seasonal influence is an important consideration based on our business in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.  The Americas and Europe regions have historically been the stronger geographies in our March quarters, as they have fewer holidays impacting their business.  However, all geographies will be impacted by the Christmas build from the December quarter.  Taking all of these factors into consideration, we expect revenues to grow in the March quarter by 1 to 4% compared to the December quarter.  EPS for the March quarter is expected to be between 19 and 20 cents," Mr. Sanghi concluded.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional 2.5 million shares of its Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The Board of Directors previously authorized on August 7, 2002 a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 millions shares and on March 11, 2004, authorized an additional stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares of its Common Stock.  Microchip has been buying stock in the open market since that date.  Approximately 2.3 million shares were repurchased in the March quarter at a cost of approximately $61 million.  Prior to the additional 2.5 million share authorization announced today, as of April 21, 2004 approximately 847,000 shares remained available for purchase.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
 
"Net sales and EPS both exceeded the high end of our expectations for the March quarter.  During the quarter, sales of microcontroller products were up 7.8% sequentially, driven by our leadership position in Flash microcontrollers.  About half of our microcontroller products in production at Microchip are now Flash-based microcontrollers, and we provide Flash-based microcontroller solutions for the broad requirements of our customers," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "For the last three years, all of the Company's new microcontroller product development has been in Flash-based microcontrollers, and almost all of our microcontroller revenue growth is coming from Flash-based microcontrollers."
Mr. Sanghi continued, "We are seeing strong design win activity, and the current booking rate is spectacular.  Our customer base continues to expand in new markets and applications, and we are now serving over 43,000 customers worldwide.  During the quarter, we shipped 11,380 new development systems, with a record 43,006 development systems shipped in fiscal year 2004.  This exceeds our previous record set in fiscal 2003 by 22%."
 
"Analog sales in the fourth quarter were up 8.1% sequentially, reaching a record level since the acquisition of TelCom Semiconductor three years ago.  Our customer base for analog products continues to expand, and has grown from 2,857 customers in early 2001 to 8,935 customers today.  We added another 444 analog customers in the March 2004 quarter," said Mr. Richard Simoncic, Vice President, Analog and Interface Products Division.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "We continued to have strong cash generation in the quarter of approximately $75 million.  During the quarter, we bought back approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.61 per share.  We ended the quarter with $475 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory fell by $1.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter, with inventory days dropping from 108 days at the end of December to 101 days at the end of March, in line with the guidance we previously provided.  We expect inventory days to further improve to 96 - 98 days by the end of the June quarter," Mr. Parnell added.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon executed superbly in its second quarter of production.  Fab 4 has increased output five times already since its start up in October 2003.  Fab 4 is currently on a steep ramp and is executing nearly flawlessly," said Mr. David Lambert, Vice President of Fab Operations.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our bookings in the quarter were an all-time record, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.28.  We are seeing strong demand characteristics in all areas of our business.  We started the June quarter with 67% of the quarter in backlog, which has filled to 84% during the first three weeks of April.  We currently expect our net sales in the June quarter will grow by 7% to 8% sequentially, and EPS is expected to be about 25 cents."
Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2004 Highlights:
 
Microchip announced the shipment of its three billionth PIC microcontroller to American Power Conversion (APC). The three-billionth unit was the PIC18F452 8-bit Flash microcontroller, which uses Microchip's latest architecture and proprietary high-reliability PMOS Electrically Erasable Cell (PEEC) Flash technology.  Microchip delivered its one-billionth microcontroller in the fall of 1999 after 10 years of operation, the two-billionth shipment occurred fewer than 30 months later in the spring of 2002, and now the three-billionth shipment has been achieved in less than two years  establishing a strong pattern of growth.  These milestones demonstrate the industry's continued acceptance of Microchip's PIC microcontrollers as the high-performance, cost-effective solution for embedded control designs.
 - 
                 
 
The Company reached another significant milestone by delivering its 300,000th development system during the quarter.  Few semiconductor companies can match Microchip in the total number of tools installed in the field.  The MPLAB In Circuit Debugger (ICD) 2 achieved strong sales growth during the fourth quarter.  Total cumulative development system shipments now stand at 305,000.

Microchip debuted the PS700 PowerSmart battery monitor that provides precise battery information needed to calculate the battery capacity for hand-held and mobile products.  The PS700 supports battery-operated products to extend system run times while providing greater predictability of use. The device sets expectations of run time, charge time and battery state of health; meanwhile, it accurately monitors and reports current operational conditions and battery status for use in system power management.
 
A series of 750 kHz gated oscillator DC/DC boost controllers was introduced. The MCP1650/51/52/53 devices can deliver 5 Watts of power to the load while consuming only 120 microamps of quiescent current at no load. The DC/DC boost controllers are used to generate the supply voltage for microcontrollers and other electronic loads from a battery supply or the bus voltages available in the system.
 - 
                 
 
Microchip announced a low dropout regulator (LDO), stable with ceramic capacitors, that operates at a very low supply current. Attachable to practically any microcontroller, the MCP1700 is a low-cost, low-power LDO ideal for virtually any portable or battery-powered application.

Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $212.8 million, up 11.1% sequentially from $191.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 31.9% from sales of $161.3 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was a record $56.8 million or 27 cents per diluted share, up 21.2% from GAAP net income of $46.8 million or 22 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 321.5% from GAAP net income of $13.5 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter; and up 69.5% from pro forma net income of $33.5 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter.  Pro forma diluted earnings per share for the prior year's first quarter exclude the effects of accelerated depreciation and other related charges associated with the closure of Fab 1 in Chandler, Arizona.  A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.046 per share on its common stock, increasing the dividend by 15%.  The cash dividend is payable on September 1, 2004 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2004.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased the cash dividend by 130% since the initial declaration.
 
"This was the best quarter for Microchip in its entire history.  In the quarter ended June 30, 2004 we achieved record net sales, record gross margin percentage, record operating profit percentage and record earnings per share," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "For about a year or so, we have been guiding investors and analysts towards a business model of 57% to 58% gross margin and 33% to 34% operating profit by the end of fiscal year 2005.  I am very pleased to have delivered these results three quarters ahead of schedule."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Net sales and EPS both exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.  During the quarter, sales of all product lines showed significant sequential increases.  Microcontroller sales achieved another record and were up 9.3% sequentially, driven by our continuing leadership position in Flash microcontrollers.  Analog sales were up a very solid 15.5% sequentially, reaching a record level since the acquisition of TelCom Semiconductor three-and-a-half years ago.  Serial EEPROM memory products were up approximately 20% sequentially, reflecting healthy market conditions."
 
"We have a very strong new product introduction and design cycle underway.  With our recent announcement of the world's smallest microcontroller in a 6-pin package, the release of about 50 new Flash microcontrollers in the last year, the release of eight new dsPIC products and about 23 new analog products, we are seeing very robust design win activity.  We are continuing to find a large number of new opportunities in the 8-bit microcontroller market.  In addition, we have expanded our served available market with the dsPIC digital signal controllers in the 16-bit microcontroller space.  Our customer base continues to expand in new markets and applications, and we are now serving over 43,000 end customers worldwide.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, we shipped 14,624 new development systems, another all time record, demonstrating the continued strong acceptance of our products.  The total number of development systems shipped now stands at 319,624," Mr. Sanghi continued.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to have strong free cash generation of approximately $87.1 million in the first fiscal quarter.  During the quarter, we bought back 852,900 shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.76 per share.  We ended the quarter with $538.9 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory fell by $3.9 million in the first fiscal quarter, with inventory days dropping from 101 days at the end of March to 91 days at the end of June, lower than the guidance we previously provided, driven by the improved revenue performance for the quarter.  We have now achieved our target model for days of inventory," Mr. Parnell added.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon, executed superbly in the quarter ended June 30, its third quarter of production.  Fab 4 has increased wafer starts several times now and at the current production rate, the wafer cost of Fab 4, based on comparable technologies has already matched that of our fully utilized Fab 2, and we anticipate further improvements going forward," said Mr. David Lambert, Vice President of Fab Operations.

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 21, 2004  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $220.7 million, up 31% from sales of $168.5 million in the prior year's second quarter, and up 3.7% sequentially from $212.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was a record $60.4 million or 29 cents per diluted share, up 67.4% from GAAP net income of $36.1 million or 17 cents per diluted share in the prior year's second quarter; up 6.5% from pro forma net income of $56.8 million or 27 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 38.1% from GAAP net income of $43.8 million or 21 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. Pro forma diluted earnings per share for the immediately preceding quarter excludes the effects of a special charge related to the settlement of patent license litigation. A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.052 per share on its common stock, increasing the dividend by 13%. The cash dividend is payable on December 1, 2004 to stockholders of record on November 15, 2004. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased the cash dividend by 160% since the initial declaration.
 
"I am particularly proud of our solid execution in the September quarter, in the face of very difficult conditions in the overall semiconductor industry during the quarter. We met our operating margin and earnings per share guidance and achieved sequential net sales growth of approximately 4%," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "These accomplishments reflect well on our overall business strength, given many companies in the semiconductor industry reported revenue that was sequentially down, and many companies also missed their original revenue guidance substantially."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Microcontroller sales achieved new record levels and were up sequentially by approximately 6%, while both analog and memory sales were sequentially lower. Our strength in Flash microcontrollers, the market drive to programmable solutions and numerous new, emerging applications continue to expand our penetration in the overall 8-bit market."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our free cash flow in the September quarter was $67 million net of a settlement of $21.1 million related to patent license litigation. We continued to be active in our stock buy-back program, executing a buy-back of 1,682,600 shares at an average price of $26.30 during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $606 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory continued to fall during the September quarter. Inventory days were 87 days as of the end of September, compared to 91 days at the end of the preceding quarter," Mr. Parnell added. "When we combine total inventory on our balance sheet and at our distributors worldwide, total inventory supporting our customer base was essentially flat at September 30, 2004, compared to the preceding quarter."
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Similar to many other companies in the industry, we saw weakness in our bookings in the September quarter, and we started the December quarter with 55% of the quarter in backlog. Taking into account the current industry conditions, we expect net sales and net income in the December quarter to be flat with the September period."

Microchip Technology
Reports Third Quarter
Fiscal Year 2005 Results
 
"Net sales in the December quarter did not meet our initial expectations, as a result of a combination of lower turns from our direct customers and sell-through in the distributor channel being lower than originally anticipated," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "All product segments and each geographic region were sequentially down, indicating a broad-based impact on our business, as we communicated in our business update on December 1, 2004."
 
"Although we are disappointed that overall industry conditions have resulted in sequentially down revenues for Microchip, we are nonetheless encouraged by the continuing resilience of our business model.  Despite the conditions we experienced in the December quarter, our gross and operating margins remain among the best in the industry.  We have always managed our business through industry cycles based on a longer-term focus on overall results, returning higher highs and higher lows in operating performance.  We certainly believe that to be the case in the current business environment," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Although we slightly moderated capacity utilization in our wafer fabs, inventories grew by $7.8 million to $97.8 million in the December quarter, approximating 101 days of inventory.  The majority of the products in our portfolio have longer effective lives in comparison to many semiconductor companies, allowing Microchip the ability to effectively manage inventory levels as we navigate through changing industry conditions.  As we have demonstrated in the past cycles, this is the most appropriate method to manage our business, improving shareholder value as we monetize the value of our inventory over time."
 
"Our free cash flow generation continues to be very strong, as we increased our treasury balance by approximately $90 million in the December quarter.  After consideration of the continuing strength of our cash flow, the Board of Directors has decided to increase the dividend yield by 35% sequentially to 7 cents per share.  This decision confirms the intent we have shared with investors to continue to increase the dividend yield as a means of returning value to our shareholders," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "The March quarter has historically been seasonally challenged for Microchip as a result of the effects of the Lunar New Year in Asia, and the effect is further magnified as our business in that region has continued to outgrow the other geographies.  Although the book-to-bill ratio in December for our direct business returned to approximately parity, our overall book to bill was 0.88, resulting in lower backlog visibility for the current period.  The Americas and Europe will have more ship days in the
 
 
current quarter compared to the December quarter, which was impacted by the Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays, but Asia will have fewer ship days due to the Lunar New Year holidays.  Based on our assessment of the overall environment and our business outlook, we believe our March net sales will be approximately flat with December, with earnings per share of about 25 cents."
 
Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2005 Highlights:
 
Microchip announced the first Flash PIC microcontrollers with full-speed USB 2.0 connectivity and 48 MHz operation for 12 megabits-per-second data-transfer rates.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management.  Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making.  We present non-GAAP information for the following line items:  cost of sales, special charges, operating income, income before income taxes, income taxes and net income.  The non-GAAP adjustments for each of these non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors allows them to focus on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business. Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.  This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructurings and special charges that may have a material effect on the Company's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations.  We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
At a meeting held on February 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the "Company") approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain Company stock options with an option price of $27.153 per share or greater.  The purpose of the accelerated vesting is to enable the Company to avoid recognizing in its income statement compensation expense associated with these options in future periods, upon adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R (Share-Based Payment) in July 2005.  The pre-tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately $13.1 million over the course of the original vesting period.  The Company also believes that because the accelerated options have exercise prices close to or in excess of the current market values of the Company's common stock, the options were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention, and that the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale and retention.  The accelerated vesting is effective for stock options outstanding as of February 17, 2005.  As a result of the accelerated vesting, approximately 2.3 million option shares or 25.4% of the total number of outstanding unvested option shares with varying remaining vesting schedules became immediately exercisable.  In order to help avoid unintended personal benefits to the holders of certain of the accelerated options, any shares received through the exercise of these accelerated options may not be sold by the option holder until the first to occur of the original vesting date of the accelerated option or the termination of the employment of the option holder.  Of the aggregate number of option shares subject to the acceleration, 461,250 option shares are held by the Company's executive officers as follows:  Steve Sanghi, 206,400 shares;  Steve Drehobl, 46,538 shares; David Lambert, 39,000 shares; Mitchell Little, 39,937 shares; Ganesh Moorthy, 51,375 shares; Gordon Parnell, 39,000 shares and Richard Simoncic, 39,000 shares.  In connection with the accelerated vesting, each option agreement underlying such options will be amended.

CHANDLER, Arizona  April 27, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and the three months ended March 31, 2005.  Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were $846.9 million, an increase of 21.1% from net sales of $699.3 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $213.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, an increase of 55.8% from net income of $137.3 million, or 65 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $226.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, an increase of 44.6% from net income of $156.8 million, or 74 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 exclude special charges related to the settlement of patent license litigation and costs associated with the closure of Fab 1, respectively.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $208.1 million, up 1.3% sequentially from sales of $205.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 8.7% from sales of $191.5 million in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.  GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $56.4 million or 27 cents per diluted share, up 6.1% from GAAP net income of $53.1 million or 25 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 20.4% from GAAP net income of $46.8 million or 22 cents per diluted share in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.095 per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 3, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 13, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
 
"Establishing record levels in fiscal 2005 in many key areas of our enterprise continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Record levels in net sales, gross and operating margins and net income reflect our strong market position."
 
"We also returned to a pattern of sequential revenue growth in the March 2005 quarter after only one quarter of inventory correction, with growth of 1.3%.  We have also focused on cost improvements in our business, resulting in record gross margins of 57.4% and EPS of 27 cents for the March quarter," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days at the end of March were 107 days.  While up sequentially by 6 days, inventory was at the low end of our expectations.  We fully expect that inventory days will begin to decline in the June quarter, validating our factory utilization and inventory strategy."
 
"Our annual cash flow for fiscal 2005 established new record levels of $328.3 million for Microchip.  With confidence in our future cash flows, we have increased our dividend payment to 9.5 cents, representing a sequential increase of 36%, an annual increase of 138% and a 375% increase since dividend inception," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Based on our assessment of our business and the overall economic environment, we anticipate sequential net sales growth of about 5% in the June quarter.  With our book-to-bill ratio reaching approximately parity in the March 2005 quarter and continuing strong customer demand in April to date, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve a solid growth quarter.  Based on our expectations, EPS will be about 28 cents."
 
Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2005 Highlights:
 
 - 
                 
Microchip shipped 15,706 new development systems in the quarter and 53,311 during fiscal year 2005.  Both are record numbers, demonstrating the continued strong interest in our products.  The total cumulative number of development systems shipped now stands at 358,311.

Microchip announced four new high pin count, high-density members of the PIC18F microcontroller family, offering the most cost-effective 96 and 128 Kbytes of self-reprogrammable, high-endurance Flash memory with up to 10 MIPS performance over a wide operating voltage range of 2.0 to 5.5V.  These features, combined with nanoWatt Technology power management and a rich set of analog and digital peripherals, allow this microcontroller series to compete with 16-bit devices in high-end embedded applications while retaining ease of use and helping designers to preserve their 8-bit development tool and software investments.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip introduced the PIC16F785 8-bit Flash microcontroller which provides a complete set of integrated peripherals for cost-effective digital control in power-conversion designs.  This device has a large complement of onboard analog peripherals, including A/D converters, comparators, a voltage reference and two operational amplifiers, which also appeals to a broad range of sensing and closed-loop control applications.
 
 - 
                 
Four new 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers (DSCs) began volume production, offering designers performance speeds of 20 and 30 million instructions per second, self-programming capabilities via Flash memory, and industrial and extended temperature ranges.  The dsPIC30F3014 and dsPIC30F4013 extend the package and memory range of the General Purpose Family, adding 24 and 48 Kbytes of Flash program memory respectively, in a package as small as an 8x8 millimeter QFN.  In the Motor Control and Power Conversion Family, the dsPIC30F3010 and dsPIC30F3011 feature 24 Kbytes of Flash program memory and can operate at full speed using an internal oscillator.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip launched five software libraries for its 16-bit dsPIC DSCs, making it easy for engineers to add new functionality to their designs.  The Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Noise Suppression Libraries for dsPIC DSC-based speaker and microphone applications provide a cost-effective, easy way to improve sound quality and intelligibility.  The Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption Libraries for secure embedded transaction communications cost effectively reduce the risk of unwanted data manipulation or interpretation with single dsPIC DSCs.  The Speech Recognition Library provides engineers with a way to use one dsPIC DSC for both controlling an application and recognizing speech commands, eliminating the need for a dedicated speech IC.

The new MCP1612 single 1.0 amp 1.4 MHz synchronous buck regulator is capable of regulating battery and bus voltages down to levels required by operating systems.  The device is ideally suited to be powered from a single Lithium Ion cell, multiple alkaline or Nickel Metal Hydride cells or 5.0/3.3V DC bus voltages.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip expanded its thermal management solutions with the proprietary MCP9700/MCP9701 temperature sensors.  These devices offer a small SC-70 package, low power of 6 microamp current consumption (typical) and low cost of 30 cents each in thousand-unit quantities, creating an attractive alternative to using thermistors.  They provide a complete, easy-to-use solution for hundreds of embedded applications that require thermal protection, temperature measurement or thermal calibration.
 
First Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook:
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are currently anticipated to be approximately $218 million, up approximately 5% from the March 2005 quarter.
 
 - 
                 
Gross margins for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 57.5%.  Generally, gross margins fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions.
 
 - 
                 
Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 25%.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue, foreign currency effects on our business, and profit levels.
 
 - 
                 
The tax rate for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 
 - 
                 
Earnings per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 28 cents.
 
 - 
                 
Inventories at June 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 100 to 104 days.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 
 - 
                 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately $15 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2006 are expected to total approximately $55 to $60 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 
 - 
                 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect to add approximately $80 million to our existing cash balances during the quarter ending June 30, 2005.  This amount is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip announced on March 11, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares, and on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized an additional stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.  At March 31, 2005, approximately 1.6 million shares remained available for purchase under these programs.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management.  Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making.  The non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors allows them to focus on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.  This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States.  It excludes items such as restructurings and special charges, that may have a material effect on the Company's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations.  We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.
 
 
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME
 
 
 
(a)
         
In the three-month period ended June 30, 2004, we recorded a special charge of $21.1 million with a related tax benefit of $8.1 million for a patent license litigation settlement with U.S. Philips Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together "Philips") which had been ongoing for the past several years.  The settlement included a dismissal of the pending litigation and the cross-license of certain patents between Philips and Microchip.
 
(b)
        
In the three-month period ended June 30, 2003, we closed our Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and integrated certain Fab 1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication facility.  These actions resulted in $30.6 million of accelerated depreciation on Fab 1 assets and $1.1 million in related charges, including severance, material and other costs, which had a combined impact on $31.8 million on cost of sales.  In the three-month period ended June 30, 2003, operating expenses included $1.6 million of special charges recorded principally for contract cancellation, severance and other costs related to the closure of Fab 1 and other actions.  We incurred $0.9 million of such expenditures during Fiscal Year 2004.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2003, we reversed $0.7 million of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome in a settlement of a contract cancellation.  The tax benefit on the Fab 1 shutdown, severance, contract cancellations and other costs was $13.0 million.

CHANDLER, Arizona  July 26, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2005.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $218.5 million, up 5.0% sequentially from $208.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 2.7% from sales of $212.8 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $61.0 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, up 8.2% from GAAP net income of $56.4 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; up 39.3% from GAAP net income of $43.8 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter; and up 7.5% from non-GAAP net income of $56.8 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the prior year's first quarter exclude special charges related to the settlement of patent license litigation.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 12.5 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on August 12, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
"All product segments grew sequentially in the June quarter, with microcontrollers leading the way with 5.3% sequential sales growth," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Our overall sequential net sales growth of 5.0% in the June quarter compared very favorably with many of our peers and competitors in the semiconductor industry."
 
"The combination of our proprietary product positioning, where pricing is more stable than other areas of the semiconductor industry, richer product mix, and record manufacturing yields and efficiency resulted in record gross margins of 58.3% in the June quarter.  Our achievement of record net income of $61.0 million further reflects our sound business strategies," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days at the end of June were 104 days, down from 107 days at the end of the prior quarter ended March 31, 2005.  Clearly our reduction in inventory days and our improving gross margin trends validate our factory utilization and inventory strategy."
 
"Net cash generated for the June quarter met our expectations at $100.2 million for the period before the payment of $19.8 million in dividends.  We continue to return incremental value to our shareholders through an increased dividend payment, declaring a dividend payment of 12.5 cents per share, a sequential increase of approximately 32%," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter was above parity at 1.07.  While we are pleased with the overall positioning of our business entering the September quarter, we are mindful of the seasonal effects of vacation shutdowns in several regions of Europe during this quarter.  Based on our overall assessment of the business we anticipate sequential net sales growth in the September quarter of about 4% and EPS in the September quarter of approximately 30 cents."

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 20, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2005.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were a record $227.3 million, up 4.0% sequentially from $218.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 3.0% from sales of $220.7 million in the prior year's second quarter.  GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, up 7.6% from GAAP net income of $61.0 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 8.6% from GAAP net income of $60.4 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 16 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on November 18, 2005 to stockholders of record on November 3, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"All product segments grew sequentially in the September 2005 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall, as well as record microcontroller sales," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Asia was our fastest growing geography during September, achieving record sales levels of $101 million, representing over 44% of our overall business."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Record gross and operating margins of 59.2% and 34.9% respectively in the September quarter reflect our proprietary business model, enabling Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $65.7 million for the period.
 
"We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 28% sequentially to a record 16 cents per share," Mr. Sanghi added.  "We already had the highest dividend rate in the semiconductor industry.  With this increase, we now have a dividend rate similar to the average dividend rate of the companies in the S&P 500.  We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning value to our shareholders."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of September were at 108 days, up four days from inventory levels at June 30, 2005.  Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of September was lower than inventory levels at the end of June, resulting in the overall inventory supporting our business being essentially flat from June to September."
 
"We generated net cash for the September period of $113.7 million, before the payment of $26.2 million in dividends," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "While our overall book-to-bill ratio was at parity for the September quarter, our direct customers' book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 and our distribution channel book-to-bill was below parity, reflecting the tight asset management in that channel.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the December quarter to be approximately $234 million, sequential growth of 3%, and EPS of approximately 32 cents."
 
 
Microchip's Recent Highlights:
 
Microchip significantly expanded its presence in the growing $4 billion 16-bit microcontroller market space with the recent announcement of 49 new 16-bit PIC microcontrollers and dsPIC digital signal controllers.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 Outlook:
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are currently anticipated to be approximately $234 million, up approximately 3% from the September 2005 quarter.
 
Gross margins for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are expected to be approximately 59.5%.  Generally, gross margins fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are expected to be approximately 24.5% of net sales.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue, foreign currency effects on our business, and profit levels
 - 
                 
.
 
The tax rate for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 - 
                 
Earnings per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 32 cents.
 - 
                 
 
Inventories at December 31, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately flat in number of days with the September quarter.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 - 
                 
 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2005 are expected to be approximately $20 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are expected to total approximately $60 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect net cash generation during the December quarter of approximately $100 million before the dividend payment of approximately $34 million announced today.  The amount of expected cash generation is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 - 
                 
 
Microchip announced on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.

INCREASED DIVIDEND BY 18.8% SEQUENTIALLY, TO A RECORD 19 CENTS PER SHARE
 
CHANDLER, Arizona  January 19, 2006   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2005.  Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were a record $234.9 million, up 3.3% sequentially from $227.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 14.4% from sales of $205.4 million in the prior year's third quarter.  GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $70.7 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, up 7.7% from GAAP net income of $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 33.1% from GAAP net income of $53.1 million, or 25 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's third quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 19 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on February 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on February 2, 2006.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"Revenue from both our microcontroller and analog products grew sequentially and reached record levels in the December 2005 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Analog products delivered exceptional performance, with revenue growing approximately 18% sequentially, and approximately 40% over the year ago quarter."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "From a geographic perspective, Asia was again our fastest growing geography during the December quarter, achieving record sales levels of $108.6 million, representing over 46% of our overall business.  A growing portion of our Asian business continues to come from customer design activities in the Americas and Europe."
 
"We also achieved record gross and operating margins of 59.7%, and 36.0%, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, further reflecting our proprietary business model," Mr. Sanghi added.  "The record net sales as well as operating margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $70.7 million for the period."
 
"We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 18.8% sequentially to a record 19 cents per share," Mr. Sanghi added.  "We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning increasing value to our shareholders."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of December were at 111 days, up three days from inventory levels at September 30, 2005.  Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of December was essentially the same as levels at the end of September."
 
"We generated record net cash for the December quarter of $126 million, before the payment of $34 million in dividends and $3 million in stock buyback activity," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "We achieved record new bookings in the December quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.04.  Our starting backlog in the March quarter is higher than what we experienced in the December quarter, although March is normally a seasonally weak quarter for Microchip.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the quarter ending March 31, 2006 to be approximately $242 million, providing sequential growth of 3%.  Earnings per share are expected to be 34 cents."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS
 
Chandler, Arizona  February 6, 2006 (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated today announced that it has decided to take advantage of the temporary incentive available to it under the Americans Jobs Creation Act (the "Jobs Act"), and will repatriate $500 million of its foreign earnings under the provisions of the Jobs Act.  As a result, Microchip recorded additional tax expense of $30.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 related to its decision to repatriate foreign earnings.  Additionally, Microchip plans to pursue a ruling from a government taxing authority which could potentially reduce the tax expense related to the repatriation by up to approximately $6.0 million.  If a favorable ruling is received on this matter, Microchip would reduce its tax expense in the period the ruling was received.  Microchip intends to continue to permanently invest the remainder of its foreign earnings offshore.  Microchip had previously reported its financial results for the December 31 quarter on January 19, 2006.  The additional one-time tax expense described above will have the effect of reducing the previously reported earnings per share for the December 31, 2005 quarter from $0.33 to $0.19.
 
Cautionary Statement:
 
The statements contained in this release relating to plans to pursue a ruling from a government taxing authority, a potential reduction in tax expense of up to approximately $6.0 million associated with this ruling, and our intention to have the remainder of our foreign earnings permanently invested offshore are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to:  actual cash flows generated from and used in the operation of our business; the outcome of the ruling from the taxing authority; actual or projected levels of capital expenditures; our balance of cash and cash equivalents; and general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.

Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were $927.9 million, an increase of 9.6% from net sales of $846.9 million in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was $242.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, an increase of 13.4% from net income of $213.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was $273 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, an increase of 20.4% from net income of $226.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 exclude a tax charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and a special charge related to the settlement of patent license litigation, respectively. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 21.5 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 23, 2006 to stockholders of record on May 9, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"We are very pleased to have delivered another record quarter in nearly every respect. Both our microcontroller and analog product revenues grew sequentially to record levels in the March 2006 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "While our overall microcontroller revenue grew 4.9% sequentially and 17.8% from the year ago quarter, our Flash microcontrollers were up a strong 9.6% sequentially and up 42% compared to the same quarter last fiscal year."
 
Mr. Sanghi stated, "Our 16-bit microcontroller revenue exhibited very strong sequential revenue growth, increasing by approximately 46% to a new record, albeit from a small base. Microchip's analog product revenue also delivered robust performance, growing approximately 17% sequentially, and 52% over the year ago quarter. In addition to continued healthy expansion in our core 8-bit microcontroller business, Microchip is gaining a strong foothold in these two very important and strategic market segments."

Fiscal Year 2006 Results
 
"Development systems continued to be shipped at a brisk pace during fiscal 2006, demonstrating strong customer demand for our products," said Ganesh Moorthy, Vice President, Advanced Microcontroller and Memory Division. "During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and for the fiscal year 2006 we shipped a record 19,991 and 73,705 systems, respectively."
 
"Our continued strong performance is also a tribute to several initiatives over the last two years, where Microchip has taken increasingly higher levels of direct control of demand creation on our products," Mr. Sanghi continued. "While the fulfillment of orders continues to be through distributors, Microchip has added significantly to direct sales, applications and training resources to accelerate design-in activity for our products. We are definitely pleased with the results."
 
Mr. Sanghi said, "From a geographic perspective, Europe led this quarter's growth with net sales up approximately 18% sequentially. The Americas delivered net sales growth of approximately 9% sequentially, while Asia net sales were lower by approximately 4%, reflecting the seasonal factors in that geography related to the Lunar New Year holidays.
 
"We achieved record gross and operating margins of 60.1% and 36.2% respectively in the March 2006 quarter, further evidencing our proprietary business model," Mr. Sanghi added. "The record net sales as well as operating margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $75.6 million for the period."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 13.2% sequentially, to a record 21.5 cents per share. We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning additional value to our shareholders."
 
"On a full fiscal year basis, we achieved record net sales in microcontrollers, analog products, gross margin percentage, operating margin percentage, earnings per share, net cash generation, and dividend payments," Mr. Sanghi added.

Reports Fourth Quarter and
Fiscal Year 2006 Results
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of March were at 106 days, down 5 days from inventory levels at December 31, 2005. Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of March was 2.0 months, which is in the same range as it was at the end of December."
 
"We generated net cash for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $110 million, before the payment of $40.5 million in dividends. For fiscal 2006, we generated net cash flow of approximately $450 million, before dividend payments of $120 million and stock buyback activity of $3 million," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "We achieved record bookings in the March quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Our starting backlog in the June quarter is higher than the levels entering the March quarter. Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the June 2006 quarter to be up 5% to 6% sequentially. Earnings per share are expected to be about 37 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of all stock-based compensation expense. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 35 cents."

Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect net cash generation during the June quarter of approximately $120 million before the dividend payment of approximately $46 million announced today. The amount of expected cash generation is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management. Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors focuses on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business. In the past, we have reported non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The historical non-GAAP information in this press release excludes items such as a special charge for a litigation settlement and a tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which may have a material effect on our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the
Microchip Technology
Reports Fourth Quarter and
Fiscal Year 2006 Results
 
when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations. In addition, in this press release we have provided EPS guidance on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). This non-GAAP financial measure excludes the income statement effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. We plan to report our future results on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis to exclude such 123R effects and will include a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our future announcements. We are disclosing this non-GAAP information to the public to enable investors to more easily assess our performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with other companies that separately identify share-based compensation expenses. In particular, as we begin to apply 123R, we believe it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of 123R are being reflected on our income statements.

CHANDLER, Arizona - July 20, 2006 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were $262.6 million, up 6.2% sequentially from $247.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 20.2% from sales of $218.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment at the beginning of the quarter and this is the first period that costs associated with the Companys stock option and employee stock purchase plans are included within its financial statements. As such, the Company has included additional information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the effect of all share-based compensation expense, was a record $81.4 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, up 7.7% from GAAP net income of $75.6 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 33% from GAAP net income of $61.0 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was a record $77.0 million or 35 cents per diluted share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is included as part of this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 23.5 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on August 17, 2006 to stockholders of record on August 3, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
We are very pleased to have delivered yet another record quarter in nearly every respect. Net sales exceeded the one billion dollar run rate for the first time in our history, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. Net sales also exceeded the high end of our guidance. The revenue growth was driven by our microcontroller business which grew a robust 8.2% sequentially and was up 21.0% over the year ago quarter. Our Flash microcontroller business was even stronger and grew 12.1% sequentially and over 46% from the year ago quarter.
We also achieved another record quarter in development system shipments. We shipped a record 20,921 development tools in the quarter, demonstrating continued strong customer interest in our products, said Ganesh Moorthy, Vice President, Advanced Microcontroller and Memory Division.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Our revenue growth was very broad-based, as we grew in all major geographies. Growth was led by Asia which was up 11% sequentially, followed by Europe which grew by 3.8% sequentially, and Americas grew 1.8% sequentially.
Mitch Little, Microchips Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Applications said, Our continued strong performance was directly influenced by several initiatives over the last 3 years, where Microchip has taken an increasingly higher level of direct control of demand creation for our products. Microchip has significantly added to its technical sales, application engineering and customer training resources to accelerate design-in activity for our products. At the same time, we have added several regional distributors and catalog houses. These regional distributors have dedicated significant technical resources applied to creating demand specifically for Microchip. We are definitely pleased with the results. Our success and growth are vindicating this strategy.
We achieved record gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins of 60.4% and 36.4%, respectively, in the June 2006 quarter, Mr. Sanghi added.
Sanghi continued, We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 9.3% sequentially, to 23.5 cents per share. We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning additional value to shareholders.

Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of June, prior to the effects of share-based compensation expense, were 101 days, down 5 days from inventory levels at March 31, 2006. Inventory days including the effects of share-based compensation were 102 days. Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of June was 2.0 months, which is at the lower end of the historical range of 1.9 to 3.3 months.
We generated a record net cash flow for the June 2006 quarter of $136.5 million, before the payment of $46.1 million in dividends, Mr. Parnell added.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, With broad-based strength and low inventory in the channels, we expect net sales in the September 2006 quarter to be up about 4% sequentially. With decreasing inventory at Microchip, we are also preparing our factories with equipment and personnel to execute the needed ramp. Earnings per share are expected to be about 39 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation expense. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 37 cents.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.

Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes all share-based compensation expense, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods, which we believe is useful to investors. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. Our measure of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Amendments to 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
On August 18, 2006, the stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved an amendment to the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan) to remove the 30% limitation on the number of shares that can be granted as restricted stock units (RSUs). The amendment was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on May 1, 2006. The purpose of the amendment was to enable the Company to continue to grant RSUs as its primary equity compensation incentive. The Equity Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (which may be granted in the form of restricted stock shares or RSUs), performance shares, performance units, and deferred stock units to Company employees, including executive officers, and consultants as well as for automatic grants of awards to the non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee or its delegates may determine the awards to be made under the Equity Plan, but for the CEO whose awards are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee alone.
On August 18, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors further amended the Equity Plan such that the annual option grants for non-employee directors would be made on the date of the Companys annual stockholders meeting. Prior to the amendment, the grant date for such awards had been the first day of the month in which the annual stockholders meeting was scheduled.
A copy of the Equity Plan, as amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan
On August 18, 2006, the stockholders of the Company approved the Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Executive Plan) to replace the Companys existing Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Management Plan) as it applies to executive officers.
The Executive Plan was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on May 1, 2006.
The Executive Plan will be effective on October 1, 2006 and provides for the payment of cash bonuses to the Companys executive officers based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee after receipt of recommendations from the Companys CEO. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee will determine whether the objectives were met and determine the amount of payout to each participant. The CEO may make recommendations regarding awards to be made, other than those for himself. The purpose of the Executive Plan is to motivate the Companys executive officers to achieve performance objectives and to reward them when those objectives are satisfied.
The performance objectives for each fiscal quarter for fiscal 2007 are based upon the following areas: quarterly sequential sales growth (overall and in the Companys 16-bit and analog product divisions), gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. The quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the Companys CEO and the four other mostly highly paid executive officers participating in the Executive Plan are targeted at an aggregate of approximately $290,000 for all such officers. Because the amount of cash bonuses are dependent upon satisfaction of the performance objectives, the exact amount of the payout (if any) to an executive officer under the program cannot be determined at this time. Actual bonuses may be higher or lower than the targets depending upon the level of performance achieved by the Company. The maximum payment that any participant may receive under the Executive Plan in any Company fiscal year is $2,500,000.
A copy of the Executive Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.
Discretionary Executive Incentive Compensation
On August 18, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the Discretionary Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Discretionary Plan) to replace the discretionary portion of the Companys Management Plan as it applies to executive officers. The Discretionary Plan is intended to increase stockholder value and the success of the Company by providing incentive and reward to executive officers for exceptional performance in
2
achieving key objectives. Cash bonuses awarded under the Discretionary Plan are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee will determine whether the objectives have been met and determine the amount of payouts (if any) under the Executive Plan. The CEO may make recommendations regarding objectives and awards, other than awards for himself.
Quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the executive officers participating in the Discretionary Plan are dependent upon the satisfaction of objectives and the level of performance achieved by the Company. The exact amount of the payout (if any) to an executive officer under the program cannot be determined at this time. The quarterly payouts for fiscal 2007 will be based upon achievement of specific operational objectives as well as additional factors as the Compensation Committee may determine.
A copy of the Discretionary Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3.
Management Incentive Compensation Plan
Since 1992, the Company has had a management incentive compensation plan for motivating its executive officers, managers and senior technical employees using a formula based upon the Companys financial performance. As described above, on August 18, 2006, the Companys stockholders approved the Executive Plan to replace the Management Plan as it applies to executive officers in order to enhance the Companys ability to obtain tax deductions for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In connection with the approval of the Executive Plan and the Discretionary Plan, the Companys Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Management Plan so that it applies to awards to employees who are not executive officers and to more closely correspond to the applicable provisions of the Executive Plan and the Discretionary Plan. The purpose of the Management Plan is to motivate management and senior technical employees to achieve performance objectives and to reward them for achievement of those objectives. Incentive cash bonuses awarded under the Management Plan are calculated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or their delegates based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee or their delegates will determine whether the objectives have been met and determine the amount of payout under the Management Plan. The Management Plan also has a discretionary element to reward exceptional performance.
Quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the non-executive employees participating in the Management Plan cannot be determined at this time as they are dependent upon satisfaction of objectives and the level of performance achieved by the Company. Beginning on October 1, 2006, the Companys executive officers will not participate in the Management Plan. The performance objectives for each fiscal quarter for fiscal 2007 are based upon the following areas: quarterly sequential sales growth (overall and in the Companys 16-bit and analog product divisions), gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share, as well as additional objectives as the Compensation Committee may determine.
A copy of the Management Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4.

(3)
 
Rule 16b-3

to determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2(u) of the Plan;
 
(2)
 
to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder (other than the automatic grants to Non-Employee Directors provided for in Section 17 of the Plan);
 
(3)
 
to determine whether and to what extent Awards or any combination thereof, are granted under the Plan;
 
(4)
 
to determine the number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent units to be covered by each Award granted under the Plan;
 
 
(5)
 
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
 
(6)
 
to
determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted under the Plan. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options or SARs may be exercised or other Awards vest (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
 
(7)
 
to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;
 
(8)
 
to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;

to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 21(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options and SARs longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;
 
(10)
 
to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;

to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award (or distribution of a Deferred Stock Unit) that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld (but no more). The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
 
(12)
 
to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards; and
 
(13)
 
to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.

CHANDLER, Arizona - October 25, 2006 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were $267.9 million, up 2.0% sequentially from $262.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 17.9% from sales of $227.3 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of the fiscal year 2007. As such, the Company has included additional information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the effect of all share-based compensation expense, was $84.2 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, up 3.4% from non-GAAP net income of $81.4 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 28.2% from GAAP net income of $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $79.5 million or 36 cents per diluted share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is included as part of this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 25 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on November 22, 2006 to stockholders of record on November 8, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has promoted Mr. Ganesh Moorthy to Executive Vice President of Microchip.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a buy-back of up to 10 million shares of Microchip common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
In the face of challenging industry conditions, Microchip delivered record results in net sales, operating profit and net income in the September quarter. Net sales for the quarter ended up at approximately the mid-point of our updated guidance which we provided on September 20, 2006, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. As we indicated in that update, the Christmas builds in Asia were delayed from our initial expectations, impacting net sales from our original forecasts. Our factory in Thailand is operating at normal levels post the military coup in that country.
Sixteen-bit microcontrollers achieved 53% growth sequentially and 210% over the year ago quarter, albeit from a small base, said Ganesh Moorthy, Microchips Executive Vice President. Two and one-half years since the start of production, we believe our 16-bit microcontollers have now reached the tipping point. A large number of designs are turning to production, and we expect continued strong growth ahead.
Flash microcontrollers grew 6.7% sequentially and 42.3% over the year ago quarter, and now represent approximately 64% of total microcontroller revenues, added Mr. Moorthy.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Geographically, Asia was our strongest territory in the September quarter, growing approximately 4.5% sequentially, while both Americas and Europe were essentially flat. Europes performance, in the summer vacation quarter, delivered results above normal seasonality.
We achieved record gross margins of 60.45% and non-GAAP operating margins of 36.4% in the September 2006 quarter, Mr. Sanghi added.
--- more --
Sanghi continued, We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 6.4% sequentially, to 25 cents per share. The increase in dividends and the 10 million share buy-back authorization announced today continue to evidence Microchips commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of September, prior to the effects of share-based compensation, were 99 days, down 2 days from the inventory levels at June 30, 2006. Inventory days including the effects of share-based compensation at the end of September were 101 days.
Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of September 2006 was 1.9 months, down from 2.0 months as of the end of June 2006, Mr. Parnell added. Combined channel inventories in support of our customers at the end of September 2006 are at the lowest levels in our business in the last several years.
Mr. Sanghi said, The outlook for the December quarter continues to be challenging. We expect distributors to continue to reduce inventories in response to the industry leadtimes and overall conditions. This was certainly reflected in the book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter, which was 0.94. Although this is normally a stronger quarter for Asia, our customers response to date has been rather muted. Additionally, it is a seasonally weak quarter in the Americas and Europe because of the Christmas holidays.
With all the variables that we are monitoring in our business, we are anticipating revenues to be down approximately 5% in the December quarter. Earnings per share are expected to be about 36 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 33 cents, Sanghi concluded.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.
Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes all share-based compensation expense, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP
measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.

The statements in this release relating to 16-bit microcontrollers reaching the tipping point, a large number of 16-bit microcontroller designs turning to production, expected continued strong 16-bit microcontroller growth, that the increase in dividends and the 10 million share buy-back continue to evidence our commitment to return value to our shareholders, the outlook for the December quarter being challenging, our expectation for distributors to continue to reduce inventories, the December quarter normally being stronger for Asia but the response being muted, the December quarter being a seasonally weak quarter for the Americas and Europe, our expectation for revenues to be down approximately 5%, for non-GAAP EPS of approximately 36 cents and GAAP EPS of approximately 33 cents for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 quarter, the continued strong acceptance of Microchips products, and the statements containing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance (as applicable) for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 with respect to net sales, gross margins, operating expenses, tax rate, earnings per diluted share, days of inventory, capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 and for fiscal 2007, net cash generation and future stock repurchases are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to: changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy short-term orders from our inventory; changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity; our ability to continue to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity; competitive developments including pricing pressures; the level of orders
that are received and can be shipped in a quarter; the level of sell-through of our products through distribution; changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality; foreign currency effects on our business; costs and outcome of any current or future tax audit or any litigation
involving intellectual property, customers or other issues; disruptions in our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers due to natural disasters, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system; and general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.

CHANDLER, Arizona - October 25, 2006 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were $267.9 million, up 2.0% sequentially from $262.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 17.9% from sales of $227.3 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of the fiscal year 2007. As such, the Company has included additional information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the effect of all share-based compensation expense, was $84.2 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, up 3.4% from non-GAAP net income of $81.4 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 28.2% from GAAP net income of $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $79.5 million or 36 cents per diluted share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is included as part of this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 25 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on November 22, 2006 to stockholders of record on November 8, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has promoted Mr. Ganesh Moorthy to Executive Vice President of Microchip.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a buy-back of up to 10 million shares of Microchip common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
In the face of challenging industry conditions, Microchip delivered record results in net sales, operating profit and net income in the September quarter. Net sales for the quarter ended up at approximately the mid-point of our updated guidance which we provided on September 20, 2006, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. As we indicated in that update, the Christmas builds in Asia were delayed from our initial expectations, impacting net sales from our original forecasts. Our factory in Thailand is operating at normal levels post the military coup in that country.
Sixteen-bit microcontrollers achieved 53% growth sequentially and 210% over the year ago quarter, albeit from a small base, said Ganesh Moorthy, Microchips Executive Vice President. Two and one-half years since the start of production, we believe our 16-bit microcontollers have now reached the tipping point. A large number of designs are turning to production, and we expect continued strong growth ahead.
Flash microcontrollers grew 6.7% sequentially and 42.3% over the year ago quarter, and now represent approximately 64% of total microcontroller revenues, added Mr. Moorthy.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Geographically, Asia was our strongest territory in the September quarter, growing approximately 4.5% sequentially, while both Americas and Europe were essentially flat. Europes performance, in the summer vacation quarter, delivered results above normal seasonality.
We achieved record gross margins of 60.45% and non-GAAP operating margins of 36.4% in the September 2006 quarter, Mr. Sanghi added.
--- more --
Sanghi continued, We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 6.4% sequentially, to 25 cents per share. The increase in dividends and the 10 million share buy-back authorization announced today continue to evidence Microchips commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of September, prior to the effects of share-based compensation, were 99 days, down 2 days from the inventory levels at June 30, 2006. Inventory days including the effects of share-based compensation at the end of September were 101 days.
Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of September 2006 was 1.9 months, down from 2.0 months as of the end of June 2006, Mr. Parnell added. Combined channel inventories in support of our customers at the end of September 2006 are at the lowest levels in our business in the last several years.
Mr. Sanghi said, The outlook for the December quarter continues to be challenging. We expect distributors to continue to reduce inventories in response to the industry leadtimes and overall conditions. This was certainly reflected in the book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter, which was 0.94. Although this is normally a stronger quarter for Asia, our customers response to date has been rather muted. Additionally, it is a seasonally weak quarter in the Americas and Europe because of the Christmas holidays.
With all the variables that we are monitoring in our business, we are anticipating revenues to be down approximately 5% in the December quarter. Earnings per share are expected to be about 36 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 33 cents, Sanghi concluded.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.
Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes all share-based compensation expense, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP
measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.

This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between ________________ (the Employee) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company), effective as of ________________, 2006 (the Effective Date).
 
 
1.
  
It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
 
2.
  
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
3.
  
The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain benefits upon a Change of Control and certain benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control. These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
 
4.
  
Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 5 below.
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1.
  
Term of Agreement
. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied.
 
2.
  
At-Will Employment
. The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employees employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, except as may otherwise be specifically provided under the terms of any written formal employment agreement or offer letter between the Company and the Employee (an Employment Agreement). If the Employees employment terminates prior to the Change of Control Period, the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Agreement, or under his or her Employment Agreement if any exists in writing, or as may otherwise be available in accordance with the Companys established employee plans.
 
3.
  
Benefits
.
 
(a)
  
Benefits Upon a Change of Control
. Immediately prior to consummation of a Change of Control the Employee shall receive the following benefit:
 
(i)
  
Equity Compensation Acceleration
. One hundred percent (100%) of the Employees outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other Company equity compensation awards (the Equity Compensation Awards) shall immediately vest and become exercisable. Any Company stock options and stock appreciation rights shall remain exercisable following the Employees employment termination for the period prescribed in the respective option and stock appreciation right agreements.
 
(b)
  
Termination Other than for Cause During the Change of Control Period
. If within the three-month period preceding or any time following a Change of Control (the Change of Control Period), the Employee ceases to be employed with the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) for any reason other than Cause (as defined herein), and the Employee signs, and does not revoke, a standard release of claims with the Company in a form acceptable to the Company (the Release), then the Employee shall receive the following severance from the Company:
 
(i) 
  
Severance Payment
. The Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum severance payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to (one/two) hundred percent of the Employees annual base salary (as in effect immediately prior to (A) the Change of Control, or (B) the Employees termination of employment, whichever is greater) plus
(
one/two) hundred percent of the Employees target bonuses for which Employee was or would have been eligible (for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control or the Employees termination occurs, whichever is greater.)
 
(ii)
  
Continued Employee Benefits
. Company-paid health, dental, vision, and life insurance coverage at the same level of coverage as was provided to such Employee immediately prior to termination and at the same ratio of Company premium payment to Employee premium payment as was in effect immediately prior to termination (the Company-Paid Coverage). If such coverage included the Employees eligible dependents immediately prior to termination, such dependents shall also be covered at Company expense. Company-Paid Coverage shall continue until the earlier of (A) (twelve/twenty-four) months from the date of termination, or (B) the date upon which the Employee and his dependents become covered under another employers group health, dental, vision, long-term disability or life insurance plans that provide Employee and his dependents with comparable benefits and levels of coverage. For purposes of Title X of to the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), the date of the qualifying event for Employee and his or her dependents shall be the date upon which the Company-Paid Coverage terminates. Coverage in this Section is dependent on the valid and timely election of continued COBRA coverage under applicable law.
 
(c)
  
Timing of Severance Payments
. Except as otherwise provided herein, the severance payment to which Employee is entitled shall be paid by the Company to Employee in cash and in full, not later than ten (10) calendar days after the effective date of the Release.

(d)
  
Termination for Cause; Termination Prior to Change of Control Period
. In the event the Employees employment is terminated for Cause, or for any reason prior to the Change of Control Period, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance and any other benefits except as may then be established under the Companys existing written severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other written agreements with the Company.
 
2
(e)
  
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A

4.

Unless the Company and the Employee otherwise agree in writing, the determination of Employees excise tax liability and the amount required to be paid under this Section 4 shall be made in writing by the Companys independent auditors who are primarily used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control (the Accountants). For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 4, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 4.
 
5.
  
Definition of Terms
. The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:
 
(a)
  
Cause
. Cause shall mean (i) a willful act of personal dishonesty taken by the Employee in connection with his responsibilities as an employee and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of the Employee, (ii) Employee being convicted of, or pleading nolo contendere to, a felony that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, and (iii) following delivery to the Employee of a written demand for performance from the Company which describes the basis for the Companys reasonable belief that the Employee has not substantially performed his duties, continued violations by the Employee of the Employees obligations to the Company which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on the Employees part.
 
For the purposes of this Section 5(a), no act or failure to act shall be considered willful unless done or omitted to be done in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the act or omission was in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Any act or failure to act based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done or omitted to be done in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Employee shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Employee a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting of the Board called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to the Employee and an opportunity for the Employee with Employees counsel to be heard before the Board) finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board the Employee was properly terminated for Cause.

Change of Control
. Change of Control means
the occurrence of any of the following:
 
(i)
  
Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Companys then outstanding voting securities; or
 
(ii)
  
A change in the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors.

This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between ________________ (the Employee) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company), effective as of ________________, 2006 (the Effective Date).
 
 
1.
  
It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
 
2.
  
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
3.
  
The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control. These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
 
4.
  
Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 5 below.
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1.
  
Term of Agreement
. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied.
 
2.
  
At-Will Employment
. The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employees employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, except as may otherwise be specifically provided under the terms of any written formal employment agreement or offer letter between the Company and the Employee (an Employment Agreement). If the Employees employment terminates prior to the Change of Control Period, the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Agreement, or under his or her Employment Agreement if any exists in writing, or as may otherwise be available in accordance with the Companys established employee plans.

(i)
   
Equity Compensation Acceleration
. One hundred percent (100%) of the Employees outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other Company equity compensation awards (the Equity Compensation Awards) shall immediately vest and become exercisable. Any Company stock options and stock appreciation rights shall remain exercisable following the Employees employment termination for the period prescribed in the respective option and stock appreciation right agreements.
 
(b)
  
Involuntary Termination Other than for Cause, Voluntary Termination for Good Reason During the Change of Control Period
.

(i)
  
Severance Payment
. The Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum severance payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to one hundred percent of the Employees annual base salary (as in effect immediately prior to (A) the Change of Control, or (B) the Employees termination of employment, whichever is greater) plus
 
one hundred percent of the Employees target bonuses for which the Employee was or would have been eligible (for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control or the Employees termination occurs, whichever is greater.)
 
(ii)
  
Continued Employee Benefits
. Company-paid health, dental, vision, and life insurance coverage at the same level of coverage as was provided to such Employee immediately prior to termination and at the same ratio of Company premium payment to Employee premium payment as was in effect immediately prior to termination (the Company-Paid Coverage). If such coverage included the Employees eligible dependents immediately prior to termination, such dependents shall also be covered at Company expense. Company-Paid Coverage shall continue until the earlier of (A) twelve months from the date of termination, or (B) the date upon which the Employee and his dependents become covered under another employers group health, dental, vision, long-term disability or life insurance plans that provide Employee and his dependents with comparable benefits and levels of coverage. For purposes of Title X of the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), the date of the qualifying event for Employee and his or her dependents shall be the date upon which the Company-Paid Coverage terminates. Coverage in this section is dependent on the valid and timely election of continued COBRA coverage under applicable law.
 
(c)
  
Timing of Severance Payments
. Except as otherwise provided herein, the severance payment to which Employee is entitled shall be paid by the Company to Employee in cash and in full, not later than ten (10) calendar days after the effective date of the Release.

(d)
  
Voluntary Resignation
. If the Employees employment with the Company terminates during the Change of Control Period voluntarily by the Employee other than for Good Reason, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those described in 3(a)(i) and as may then be established under the Companys then existing severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other written agreements with the Company.
 
(e)

Notwithstanding any provision in the Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a).

(b)
 
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).

Such stockholders notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.4. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).

The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
2.6

2.7
 
Quorum
. At any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority, present in person or by proxy, of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority, present in person or by proxy, of the shares of such class or classes entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.
If a notice of any adjourned special meeting of stockholders is sent to all stockholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that it will be held with those present constituting a quorum, those present at such adjourned meeting shall constitute a quorum (but in no event shall a quorum consist of less than one-third of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting), and all matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting, except as otherwise required by law.
2.8
 
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

Waiver of Notice
. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.11
 
Stockholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting.
Any action required or able to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery to the corporations registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the date the earliest dated consent is delivered to the corporation, a written consent or consents signed by holders of a sufficient number of votes to take action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in the first paragraph of this section.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.12
 
Record Date for Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents
. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors
-5-
 
may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i)
 
The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

The record date for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall neither precede nor be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which such resolution is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.
If the board of directors has not fixed a record date within such time, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in the first paragraph of Section 2.11 of these bylaws. If the board of directors has not fixed a record date within such time and prior action by the board of directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.13
 
Proxies

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to
-6-
 
this Section 2.13 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.14
 
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote
. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each

The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

The cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the corporation.
Consents and revocations shall be delivered to the inspectors upon receipt by the corporation, the stockholder or stockholders soliciting consents or soliciting revocations in opposition to action by consent proposed by the corporation (the Soliciting Stockholders) or their proxy solicitors or other designated agents. As soon as consents and revocations are received, the inspectors shall review the consents and revocations and shall maintain a count of the number of valid and unrevoked consents. As soon as practicable after the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation in the manner provided in Section 228(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (ii) a written request therefor by the corporation or the Soliciting Stockholders (whichever is soliciting consents) (which request, except in the case of corporate action by written consent taken pursuant to the solicitations of not more than ten (10) persons, may be made no earlier than after such reasonable amount of time after the commencement date of the applicable solicitation of consents as is necessary to permit the inspectors to commence and organize their count, but in no event less than five (5) days after such commencement date), notice of which request shall be given to the party opposing the solicitation of consents, if any, which request shall state that the corporation or Soliciting Stockholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents to authorize or take the action specified in the consents has been received in accordance with these bylaws, the inspectors shall issue a preliminary report to the corporation and the Soliciting Stockholders stating: (i) the number of valid consents; (ii) the number of valid revocations; (iii) the number of valid and unrevoked consents; (iv) the number of invalid consents; (v) the number of invalid revocations; and (vi) whether, based on their preliminary count, the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents has been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents.
Unless the corporation and the Soliciting Stockholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the corporation and the Soliciting Stockholders shall have 48 hours to review the consents and revocations and to advise the inspectors and the opposing party in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the preliminary report of the inspectors. If no written notice of an intention to
-8-
 
challenge the preliminary report is received within 48 hours after the inspectors issuance of the preliminary report, the inspectors shall issue to the corporation and the Soliciting Stockholders their final report containing the information from the inspectors determination with respect to whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize and take the action specified in the consents. If the corporation or the Soliciting Stockholders issue written notice of an intention to challenge the inspectors preliminary report within 48 hours after the issuance of that report, a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue their final report to the corporation and the Soliciting Stockholders, which report shall contain the information included in the preliminary report, plus all changes made to the vote totals as a result of the challenge and a certification of whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents. A copy of the final report of the inspectors shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

CHANDLER, Arizona - January 31, 2007 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2006. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were $251 million, down 6.3% sequentially from $267.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 6.9% from sales of $234.9 million in the prior years third fiscal quarter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of the fiscal year 2007. As such, the Company has included additional information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $72.8 million or 33 cents per diluted share, down 8.4% from GAAP net income of $79.5 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 81.6% from GAAP net income of $40.1 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter.

third fiscal quarter was impacted by $30.6 million of additional tax expense as a result of a repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings under the American Job Creation Act of 2004. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the effect of all share-based compensation expense, was $78.7 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, down 6.5% from non-GAAP net income of $84.2 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 11.3% from non-GAAP net income of $70.7 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included as part of this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 26.5 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on February 28, 2007 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2007. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
In difficult industry conditions, Microchips results for the December quarter were essentially in line with the guidance we provided on November 28, 2006. While sales were slightly lower than our guidance, our gross margin performance, net earnings, EPS per diluted share and cash flow met our prior guidance, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis were off our record highs by only 15 basis points, and operating margins on a non-GAAP basis reached 35.6% of sales.
Mr. Sanghi added, Revenues in all geographies were down sequentially in the December quarter. We are seeing an inventory correction at our end customers, which together with seasonal and economic factors, has adversely affected our performance in all regions.
Sixteen-bit microcontrollers were essentially flat in the December quarter, and revenue from Flash-based microcontrollers declined 5.3% sequentially, both evidencing the market conditions we encountered in this quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Microchips Executive Vice President.
We also shipped a record 21,444 new development tools, which demonstrates continued strong design win activity and acceptance of our products, added Mr. Moorthy. The record shipment of tools is also an indicator of the success of Microchips demand creation initiatives.

Mr. Sanghi continued, We are pleased to confirm another increase in our quarterly dividend payment to our investors. We are increasing dividends by 6% sequentially, to 26.5 cents. In spite of the difficult market conditions encountered in the December period, the Board has confirmed our commitment to return value to our shareholders through the dividend payment.
Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory days on hand as of the December quarter end, prior to the effect of share-based compensation, were 108 days, an increase of 9 days from inventory levels at September 30, 2006. Inventory in the distribution channel was essentially unchanged at the end of December, at 1.9 months.
Mr. Sanghi said, The market conditions for the March quarter continue to be challenging. Our largest geography in Asia will go through the Lunar New Year holiday, which tends to impact our visibility. The March quarter has been historically the strongest growth quarter for Europe, offsetting the potential impact from Asia. We are continuing to monitor all the key variables in our business to ensure that we are aggressively pursuing all short- and longer-term business opportunities. Our opening backlog for the March quarter was higher than the opening backlog for the September quarter. However, visibility is generally low at this point in the cycle.
Based on all of these factors, we anticipate revenues to be essentially flat in the March quarter, with GAAP earnings per diluted share of 33 cents. EPS on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effects of share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately 36 cents per diluted share, Mr. Sanghi concluded.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.
Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes all share-based compensation expense, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan
In 2006, the Board of Directors and stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved the Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Executive Plan).  The Executive Plan provides for the payment of cash bonuses to the Companys executive officers based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors after receipt of recommendations from the Companys CEO. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee will determine whether the objectives were met and determine the amount of payout to each participant. The CEO may make recommendations regarding awards to be made, other than those for himself. The purpose of the Executive Plan is to motivate the Companys executive officers to achieve performance objectives and to reward them when those objectives are satisfied.
The performance objectives for each fiscal quarter for fiscal 2008 are based upon the following areas: quarterly sequential sales growth (overall and in the Companys 16-bit and analog product divisions), gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. The quarterly payments in fiscal 2008 for the Companys CEO and the four other mostly highly paid executive officers participating in the Executive Plan are targeted at an aggregate of approximately $305,000 for all such officers. Because the amount of cash bonuses are dependent upon satisfaction of the performance objectives, the exact amount of the payout (if any) to an executive officer under the program cannot be determined at this time. Actual bonuses may be higher or lower than the targets depending upon the level of performance achieved by the Company. The maximum payment that any participant may receive under the Executive Plan in any Company fiscal year is $2,500,000.
A copy of the Executive Plan was filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K dated August 18, 2006

CHANDLER, Arizona - April 26, 2007 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were
$258.2 million, up 2.9% sequentially from sales of $251 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.5% from sales of $247.2 million in the prior years fourth quarter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. As such, the Company has included additional non-GAAP information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was a record $127.7 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, up 75.3% from GAAP net income of $72.8 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 69.0% from GAAP net income of $75.6 million, or 35 cents per diluted share in the prior years fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $81.3 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, up 3.3% from non-GAAP net income of $78.7 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 7.6% from GAAP net income of $75.6 million, or 35 cents per share, in the prior years fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 were $1,039.7 million, an increase of 12% from net sales of $927.9 million in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $357 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, an increase of 47% from net income of $242.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share in the prior year.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $325.6 million or $1.48 per diluted share, an increase of 19.3% from net income of $273 million, or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 excludes a tax charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and for fiscal 2007 excludes a tax benefit related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 28 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 24, 2007 to stockholders of record on May 10, 2007. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
The results for the March quarter exceeded our guidance and demonstrated the continuing strength of our proprietary products. Net sales of our proprietary microcontroller products increased by 4% sequentially. Our Flash microcontroller product sales were even stronger, and grew 7% sequentially, reaching record levels. Additionally, our 16-bit microcontroller product sales were up 41% sequentially, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis achieved new record levels for the Company, at 60.5%. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis also exceeded our guidance.
Mr. Sanghi stated, We are also very pleased to have exceeded a billion dollars in sales in fiscal 2007 for the first time. We also achieved record cash generation from the business of $470 million during fiscal 2007. Both measures are important results from the proprietary product positioning and the excellent profitability of our business.
We have now received confirmation from Dataquests published report that Microchip is, for the first time, the #1 supplier of 8-bit microcontrollers in dollars, based on the results of calendar year 2006. With continued momentum from new product introductions and record development system shipments, we look to further extend our leadership position in the embedded control markets in future years, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Inventory days on hand as of the March quarter end, prior to the effect of share-based compensation, were 105 days, a decrease of 3 days from inventory levels at December 31, 2006. Inventory in the distribution channel also declined to 1.8 months at March 31, from 1.9 months as of December 2006.
Mr. Parnell added, Included in the results of fiscal year 2007 is a tax benefit of $52.2 million related to the closure of tax events from previous years. Based on the results of these events and our forecast information for fiscal 2008, we are reducing our effective tax rate from 24% utilized in fiscal 2007, to 20% for fiscal 2008.
Mr. Sanghi said, We anticipate revenue growth of about 5% sequentially in the June quarter, with GAAP earnings per diluted share of 37 cents. EPS on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately 40 cents per diluted share.
As we are moving into a stronger period for Microchip in the June and September quarters, we are taking appropriate actions to ramp production levels in both our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities, Mr. Sanghi concluded.
Microchips Recent Highlights:
 
MCP2030 Low-RF Demodulator 2006 Product of the Year for Best Low-Frequency RF Control Device. In their annual survey, Embedded Systems Designs readership ranked Microchip #1 in the category of Who is your primary 8-bit microcontroller vendor?.
First Quarter Fiscal 2008 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock. Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes share-based compensation expense, a tax charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature. The exclusion of tax events in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the non-recurring nature of these events. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

CHANDLER, Arizona  July 26, 2007   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2007.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $264.1 million, up 2.3% sequentially from sales of $258.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 0.6% from sales of $262.6 million in the prior years first quarter.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  As such, the Company has included additional non-GAAP information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $80.3 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, down 37.1% from GAAP net income of $127.7 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.3% from GAAP net income of $77.0 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  The immediately preceding quarter included a tax benefit related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, with an EPS effect of 23 cents.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $86.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, up 6.6% from non-GAAP net income of $81.3 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 6.5% from GAAP

net income of $81.4 million, or 37 cents per share, in the prior years first quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation expense.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 29.5 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on August 23, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2007.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
The results for the June quarter met our revised guidance for the quarter, at a sequential revenue growth of 2.3%, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis achieved record levels of 60.6%.  Earnings per share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis met our revised expectations.
Mr. Sanghi stated, Europe was the weakest area geographically, with revenues down sequentially by 5.4% after the March quarter delivered a 19% sequential increase.  Revenues associated with the U.S. housing market were weaker than we originally expected, as outlined in our press release of June 18, 2007.
Revenues from 16-bit products increased over 24% sequentially in the June quarter, while our design win momentun as well as development tool shipments remained very strong.  Sixteen-bit customers in volume production grew by 22% sequentially, and we had record quarterly shipments of 8,290 development tools," said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Days of inventory on our balance sheet and in the distribution channel both remained essentially flat quarter over quarter.  Cash generation remained very strong for the June period, representing $126.2 million prior to the dividend payment of $61.1 million in the quarter.
Mr. Parnell added, Based on the strong cash flow we are experiencing, we are pleased to increase our cash dividend by 5.4% to 29.5 cents.  This continues to be our principal vehicle to return cash to our shareholders.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% in the September quarter.  EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 36 cents, with EPS on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation, expected to be approximately 39 cents per diluted share.

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 8, 2007   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today announced its preliminary financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ending September 30, 2007.  Microchip expects net sales to be approximately $258 to $259 million, which is down approximately 2.0% sequentially from net sales of $264.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 35 cents, and earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately 38 cents.  For the September quarter of fiscal 2008, Microchip expects to be able to sustain near record level gross margins of approximately 60.4%.
Our business results for the September quarter have been adversely impacted by several factors, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Net sales associated with the U.S. housing market continued to be weak, and we also experienced weakness in other segments of our consumer-related business.
Geographically, net sales in both the Americas and Asia were below our expectations.  We believe that weakness in Asia is tied to U.S. multinational companies who manufacture at Asian subcontractors.  Europe, although down sequentially, met our expectations based on the normal seasonal trends for the region, Mr. Sanghi continued.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, We expect days of inventory to increase based on these revenue levels.  Days of inventory at September 30 are expected to be approximately 112 days, up 5 days from overall inventory levels as of the end of June.
Mr. Sanghi added, Our book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter was 0.94, leading our business into a more seasonally challenging period in the December quarter.  While we are not in a position to give specific guidance at this point, we expect that December net sales will be sequentially down.  Based on the current level of uncertainty in the consumer segment of the business, we expect that the range of our guidance will be wider than our typical level.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Our fundamental business model is still intact.  We expect our gross margin for the September quarter to be sustained at approximately 60.4%.  We continue to execute our strategic plan with substantial progress made in 16-bit microcontrollers and analog products.  During the September quarter, we introduced 9 new products in 16-bit microcontrollers, and now have 101 products in production.  We also expect 16-bit microcontroller revenue to be sequentially up in both the September and December quarters.

While we are facing the headwind in the U.S. housing and consumer segments, we are executing on other ways to create shareholder value.  We expect to maintain our quarterly increase in dividends.  We also purchased 4 million shares of Microchip stock last quarter against our 11.5 million stock buy-back authorization, and we are prepared to purchase more shares opportunistically, Mr. Sanghi concluded.

guidance, our belief that the December quarter will be challenging, uncertainty in the consumer segment of our business, net sales being sequentially down in the December quarter, range of guidance being wider, gross margin guidance, continuing to execute our strategic plan, 16-bit microcontroller revenue guidance for the September and December quarters, our ability to create shareholder value, maintaining quarterly increases in dividend, and repurchasing Microchip stock are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 23, 2007   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2007.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $258.6 million, down 2.1% sequentially from sales of $264.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 3.5% from sales of $267.9 million in the prior years second quarter.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  As such, the Company has included additional non-GAAP information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information.  GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $60.7 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, down 24.4% from GAAP net income of $80.3 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 23.7% from GAAP net income of $79.5 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second quarter.

Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $83.3 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, down 3.9% from non-GAAP net income of $86.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 1.0% from non-GAAP net income of $84.2 million, or 38 cents per share, in the prior years second quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the loss associated with the sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington, and the effect of share-based compensation.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 31 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on November 20, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2007.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Our fiscal second quarter results were in line with the lower guidance that we provided on October 8, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Revenues were down sequentially 2.1% at $258.6 million.  GAAP earnings per share were 27 cents.  Non-GAAP earnings per share, before share-based compensation and the sale of Fab 3, were 38 cents; one cent below our original guidance.
Our results in the September quarter were adversely impacted by weakness in the U.S. housing market, and weakness in other segments of our consumer-related business, continued Mr. Sanghi.  Geographically, our Asia region was flat quarter-to-quarter, while the Americas region was down 1% sequentially.  Both were lower than our original expectations based on the market conditions I indicated.  Europe was down 5.8% sequentially, due to the seasonal effects in that region, and were in line with our expectations for the quarter.
Mr. Sanghi stated, In spite of the sequential revenue decline, gross margins on a non-GAAP basis were 60.4%, at near record levels for the business.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Based on our revised capacity assessment of our production wafer fabs in Tempe, Arizona and Gresham, Oregon, plus our expected access to outside foundries, we have approximately $2.5 billion of available annual revenue capacity.  Our sale of Fab 3, which was completed on October 19, 2007, is expected to positively impact future gross and operating margins and increases available cash balances.  In particular, gross margins are expected to improve by approximately 60 basis points on a full quarter equivalent.  We believe that opportunities will be available to add to our wafer fab production requirements on a cost-effective basis when required by our business, to supplement our existing capacity.

Revenues for 16-bit products increased over 6% sequentially in the September quarter, and the number of volume customers grew over 13% sequentially.  We believe our 16-bit design-in momentum is evident in the record development tool shipments of 13,349 in the first six months of fiscal year 2008  almost three times the number of development tools sold in the first six months of fiscal year 2007, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.
Mr. Moorthy added, Revenue from Flash-based microcontrollers also grew by 1% sequentially in the September quarter, to a record revenue of $148 million.  The drop in revenue in microcontrollers in the September quarter was from our older, one-time programmable (OTP) products.  We have not developed any new OTP products in over five years, and all of our new investments have gone into Flash-based products.  Our OTP products were designed into many legacy end products in the U.S. housing and consumer markets, where the majority of our revenue decline occurred.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Days of inventory on our balance sheet increased two days in the September quarter to 109 days.  Cash generation remained strong, achieving $119.6 million in net cash generation for the quarter ending September 30, 2007.
Mr. Parnell continued, We are pleased to increase our cash dividend by 5.1% sequentially to 31 cents per share.  This increase continues to indicate to investors our commitment to dividends as the principal vehicle to return cash to our shareholders.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we used cash from treasury in the amount of $150.2 million to purchase four million shares of our stock in open market transactions.  To date, during the current quarter ending December 31, 2007, we have used cash from treasury in the amount of $28.6 million to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of our stock in open market transactions.  We intend to continue to evaluate purchasing our stock in open market transactions opportunistically, Mr. Parnell concluded.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Our book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter was 0.94.  The December quarter is seasonally challenged, due to fewer production and shipping days in the quarter.  We anticipate that customer shutdowns related to the consumer area of our business will intensify that effect.  We anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 6% in the December quarter.  Earnings per share on a GAAP basis are expected to be approximately 34 to 37 cents, and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effects of share-based compensation and a favorable tax settlement, are expected to be approximately 35 to 38 cents per share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of
management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington is a one-time event in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
 
 
 
- - more - -
 
We are using non-GAAP profit and gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes share-based compensation expense, the sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and an anticipated tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 related to a Foreign tax settlement, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non- GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of tax events and our sale of Fab 3 in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the non-recurring nature of these events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issues shares of its Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock and such dividend or distribution consists exclusively of shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination in respect of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
(a)
                                 
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the date fixed for determination for such share split or share combination. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 9.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
 
If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock any rights or warrants or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock entitling them for a period of not more than 60 calendar days to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of Common Stock at a price per share or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share, in each case, less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
(b)
                  
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights, warrants or convertible securities upon the expiration or termination of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or convertible securities been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the announcement with respect to such rights, warrants or convertible securities had not been made. In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, warrants or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.

If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. If the Board of Directors of the Company determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 9.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock.

provided
 
If the Company is obligated to repurchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.

If the Stock Price is less than $29.70 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 9.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate upon conversion.
(iii)
                              
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 33.6700 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities, subject to adjustments in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 9.04.
 
At the Company's option, in lieu of increasing the Conversion Rate as described in this Section 9.06 in the event of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company may elect to make a cash payment in respect of the Additional Shares. Such cash payment to any Holder electing to convert its Securities would be equal to the number of Additional Shares issuable upon conversion determined by reference to the table in multiplied by the effective share price of the transaction which constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change. Any such election by the Company will be disclosed in the Fundamental Change Company Notice. Once this notice has been provided, the Company may not modify or withdraw its election.
(e)
                                 
Exhibit B
 
Additional Shares or cash or Reference Property in respect of Additional Shares will be delivered to Holders who elect to convert Securities in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change on the later of (i) five days after the effectiveness of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change and (ii) the settlement date for the Securities set forth in Section 9.02(d).
(f)
                                   
 
Section 9.07. (a) If any of the following events occur:
. Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
 
any reclassification or change of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, or any other change for which an adjustment is provided in Section 9.04);
(i)
                                    
 
any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets (including
(ii)
                                 
 
 
cash or any combination of the foregoing) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; or
 
any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination of the foregoing) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock,
(iii)
                              
 
then the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that the Securities shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination of the foregoing) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance (the "") by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available to convert all such Securities) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance; that the increase to the Conversion Rate in connection with Section 9.06 shall no longer be in effect after the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. However, at and after the effective time of such transaction, any amount otherwise payable in cash upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to Section 9.03 will continue to be payable in cash and the Daily Conversion Value will be calculated based on the value of the Reference Property, and the provisions of Section 9.03 shall continue to apply following such transaction as nearly equivalent as practicable to how such provisions applied prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance. If the transaction causes Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property into which the Securities will be convertible shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such election. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 9. If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, the Reference Property receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination of the foregoing) of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
Reference Property
provided
 
 
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities maintained by the Security Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances.
 
If a Holder elects to convert Securities in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 9.06 that results in delivery of Reference Property to the Holders, any increase in the Conversion Rate by Additional Shares as set forth in Section 9.06 shall not be payable in shares of Common Stock, but shall represent a right to receive the aggregate amount of Reference Property into which the Additional Shares would convert in the transaction from the surviving entity (or an indirect or direct parent thereof).
(b)
                                
 
Section 9.08Any issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof, and the Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of Common Stock in any name other than that of the Holder, and any tax imposed by any taxing authority outside of the United States as a result of any action by the Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
. Taxes on Shares Issued.
 
Section 9.09(a) The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Securities would be held by a single Holder). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 9, in no event will the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities exceed 19.99% of the Common Stock outstanding immediately before the issuance of the Securities (which is equivalent to issuing upon conversion approximately 36.9885 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount (the "")), and if an event occurs that would otherwise result in an increase in a Conversion Rate that would result in issuance of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to or in excess the Share Issuance Cap, the Company shall, at its option, either (1) obtain the approval of its stockholders regarding the issuance of such Common

Stock or (2) deliver cash in lieu of any shares of Common Stock other deliverable in excess of the number permitted to be delivered under such rules or listing standards, based on the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date when such Common Stock would otherwise be required to be distributed.
 
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
(b)
                                
 
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
 
The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), to endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
(c)
                                 
 
If at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company shall use its reasonable efforts, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, to list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities.
(d)
                                
 
Section 9.10The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Securities for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of
. Responsibility of Trustee.
 
 
the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 9. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 9.07 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Securityholders upon the conversion of their Securities after any event referred to in such Section 9.07 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 12.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
 
Section 9.11In case:
. Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions.
 
the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9.04 other than a regularly scheduled quarterly cash dividend; or
(a)
                                 
 
the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; or
(b)
                                
 
of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; or
(c)
                                 
 
of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
(d)
                                
 
then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Securityholder at such Holder's address appearing on the Security Register, provided for in Section 3.05 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for
 
 
securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
 
Section 9.12Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities pursuant to this Article 9 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any stockholder rights plan adopted by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time. If at the time of conversion, however, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that the Holders of the Securities would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company has distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock of the Company, evidence of indebtedness or assets as provided in Section 9.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

Section 9.13
. Exchange in Lieu of Conversion.
 
If at any time when a Holder surrenders Securities for conversion prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities the Company:
(a)
                                 
 
has designated a financial institution (a "") to accept such Securities in exchange for cash and/or shares of Common Stock, equal to the consideration due upon conversion as provided in Section 9.03; and
(i)
                                    
Designated Institution
 
notifies the Holder surrendering such Securities for conversion by the second Trading Day after the Conversion Date, that it has directed the Designated Institution to make an exchange in lieu of conversion,
(ii)
                                 
 
then, notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, the Company may direct the Conversion Agent to surrender such Securities, on or prior to the commencement of the applicable Observation Period to the Designated Institution for exchange in lieu of conversion.
 
If the Designated Institution accepts Securities surrendered for exchange, it shall notify the Conversion Agent whether it shall deliver, upon exchange, all cash, all shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock and shall deliver such cash and/or shares of Common Stock, as specified in Section 9.03 to the Conversion Agent and the Conversion
(b)
                                
 
Agent shall deliver such cash and/or shares of Common Stock to the Holder, within the time period specified in Section 9.02(d), which delivery shall be deemed to satisfy the Company's conversion obligations under this Article 9 with respect to such Holder. Any Securities so exchanged by such Designated Institution shall remain Outstanding for all purposes under this Indenture.
 
If the Designated Institution agrees to accept any Securities for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration to the Conversion Agent, or if the Designated Institution does not accept such Securities for exchange, the Company shall, within the time period specified in Section 9.02(d), convert such Securities into cash and/or shares of Common Stock, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 and Section 9.03.
(c)
                                 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Company's designation of a financial institution pursuant to this Section 9.13 require such financial institution to accept any Securities for exchange.

. Acceleration of Maturity; Other Remedies; Rescission and Annulment.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default specified in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i) with respect to the Company, the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid Interest on all Outstanding Securities will become due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

In order to elect to pay the Reporting Additional Interest as the sole remedy during the first 365 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with Section 6.13 in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must (i) notify all Holders, the Trustee and Paying Agent of such election prior to the date that is 60 days after the Notice of Default is delivered to the Company. Upon the failure to timely give all Holders, the Trustee and Paying Agent such notice, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided in this Section 10.02.

. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
 
 
Section 10.04In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 12.07.
. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
Section 10.05Subject to Article 5 hereof, any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 10 shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money to Holders, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

Following the cure of all Registration Defaults requiring the payment of Additional Interest to the Holders of Debentures that are Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section, the accrual of Additional Interest will cease (without in any way limiting the effect of any subsequent Registration Default requiring the payment of Additional Interest). Additional Interest on the Debentures, if any, will accrue beginning on the date provided for in clauses 2(d)(i) through (v) above, as applicable, to, but excluding, the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured.

Indemnification
 
The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Notice Holder (including, without limitation, the Initial Purchaser), its Affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such Notice Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively referred to for purposes of this Section 6 and Section 7 as an "") from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, without limitation, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Securities), to which that Indemnified Holder may become subject, whether commenced or threatened, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such Shelf Registration Statement or any Prospectus forming part thereof, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and shall reimburse each Indemnified Holder promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Indemnified Holder in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such

This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however,
 
Each Notice Holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively referred to for purposes of this Section 6(b) and Section 7 as the Company), from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company may become subject, whether commenced or threatened, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such Shelf Registration Statement or any Prospectus forming part thereof, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished to the Company in writing by such Notice Holder expressly for use therein including its Notice and Questionnaire, and shall reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; that no such Notice Holder shall be liable for any indemnity claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Notice Holder from the sale of Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Notice Holder may otherwise have.
(b)
                                
provided, however,
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the

provided, however,
provided, further,
extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than the reasonable costs of investigation; that an indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel for the indemnified party will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of counsel to the indemnified party) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based upon advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity agreements contained in Sections 6(a) and 6(b), shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such action or claim. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses or counsel as contemplated by this section, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of a request in writing setting forth proposed settlement terms from the indemnified party and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with the aforesaid request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party
provided, however,
from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
 
The provisions of this Section 6 and Section 7 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Notice Holder, the Company, or any of the indemnified Persons referred to in this Section 6 and Section 7, and shall survive the sale by a Notice Holder of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement.

7.
                                     
Contribution.
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering and sale of the Debentures, on the one hand, and a Holder with respect to the sale by such Holder of Securities, on the other, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and such Holder on the other with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and a Holder on the other with respect to such offering and such sale shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Debentures (before deducting expenses) received by or on behalf of the Company, on the one hand, and the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by such Holder upon a resale of the Securities, on the other, bear to the total gross proceeds from the sale of all Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement in the offering of the Securities from which the contribution claim arises. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to the Company or information supplied by the Company on the one hand or to any information contained in the relevant Notice and Questionnaire supplied by such Holder on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Notice Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective number of Registrable Securities they have sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and not joint. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7 were to be determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of
pro rata
this Section 7, an indemnifying party that is a Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such indemnifying party to any purchaser exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Information Requirements.
 
The Company covenants that, if at any time before the end of the Effective Period the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will cooperate with any Holder and take such further customary action as any Holder may reasonably request in writing (including, without limitation, making such representations as any such Holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the Securities Act and customarily taken in connection with sales pursuant to such exemptions. Upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements, unless such a statement has been included in the Company's most recent report filed pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities under any section of the Exchange Act.

Each Holder at the time of any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this Section 8(a), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES NET SALES AND
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHANDLER, Arizona  January 24, 2008   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2007.  Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were $252.6 million, down 2.3% sequentially from net sales of $258.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 0.6% from net sales of $251.0 million in the prior years third quarter.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  As such, the Company has included additional non-GAAP information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information.  GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $80.1 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, up 32.0% from GAAP net income of $60.7 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 10.0% from GAAP net income of $72.8 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third quarter.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $81.2 million, down 2.5% from non-GAAP net income of $83.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 3.1% from non-GAAP net income of $78.7 million in the prior years third quarter.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record 39 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to 38 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and 36 cents per diluted share in the prior years third quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude a one-time favorable event related to the resolution of a foreign tax matter and the effect of share-based compensation.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 32 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on February 21, 2008 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
In difficult business conditions, we achieved net sales of $252.6 million, down 2.3% sequentially, and slightly better than the mid-point of our guidance, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Despite the industry conditions, we achieved record gross margins of 61.2% on a non-GAAP basis and 60.6% on a GAAP basis.  We also met the high end of our EPS guidance for GAAP and non-GAAP results of 38 and 39 cents, respectively.
As expected, Asia was the only geography to grow sequentially in the December quarter.  Both the Americas and Europe were more significantly impacted by seasonal factors in the quarter as well as economic factors, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Mr. Sanghi stated, Shipments of development tools continued at very strong levels in the December quarter, achieving record levels of shipments of 28,722 in the quarter, with worldwide cumulative shipments of over 599,000.
While overall revenues for microcontrollers were down approximately 1% sequentially, revenues were up approximately 1.5% from the year ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Sixteen-bit microcontrollers had another strong quarter with revenues up 28% sequentially and up 138% from the year ago quarter.
Mr. Moorthy added, Flash microcontroller revenues achieved a new record, and were also up 10% over the year ago quarter.  These results culminated in the shipment of our 6 billionth microcontroller in late December.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory on our balance sheet was essentially unchanged at the end of December in dollar terms, representing approximately 114 days of inventory.  Inventory in the distribution channel was approximately 1.9 months of inventory.  Overall, we remain comfortable with the levels of inventory supporting our business.
Mr. Parnell continued, Cash generation from operations of $131 million in the December quarter reflects the strong gross and operating margins of the business, as well as excellent working capital management.  Cash generation from operations excludes the dividend payment to investors of $66.4 million, $814.6 million which was used to buy back stock, and the proceeds of our junior subordinated convertible debt transaction of $1,127 million.  Cash generation for all of fiscal 2008 will be approximately $480 million.  The cornerstone of our commitment to return value to shareholders through increasing dividends was again reflected in the dividend increase to 32 cents announced today.  The strength of our business model is also demonstrated by the fact that we are at record gross margin and earnings levels while at a low point in revenues for this business cycle.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Market conditions for the March quarter include consideration of the seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia.  Our book-to-bill for the December quarter was 1.02, and the overall opening backlog position for the March quarter was significantly higher than at the beginning of the December quarter.  We expect sales to be down 2% to up 4% in the March quarter, based on current information.  EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be 35 to 38 cents, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately 39 to 42 cents.
Microchips Recent Highlights:
 
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2008 Outlook:
statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
The following
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (
ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period
and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington
and the tax benefit related to the resolution of a foreign tax matterare non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
 
We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP
net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense, the sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and a tax benefit in
the
third quarter of fiscal 2008 related to the resolution of a foreign tax matter, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that
we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors
feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non- GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based
 
compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of favorable tax events and our sale of Fab 3 in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the non-recurring nature of these events.  
Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for
gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and
non-GAAP results.

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2008 Financial Results
 
 
ended March 31, 2008.  Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 were $260.4 million, up 3.1% sequentially from net sales of $252.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 0.9% from net sales of $258.2 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $76.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, down 4.3% from GAAP net income of $80.1 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 40.0% from GAAP net income of $127.7 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter.  In December 2007, the Company issued and sold $1.15 billion of its junior convertible debentures.  As a result, the Company had an increase in interest expense, reducing after-tax income by $3.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2008.  Utilizing existing cash balances and the proceeds of the debt transaction, the Company repurchased 32.5 million shares of its common stock during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008.  Consequently, the debt transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduction in diluted common shares outstanding was greater than the increased interest expense.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $79.2 million, down 2.5% from non-GAAP net income of $81.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 2.6% from non-GAAP net income of $81.3 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record 42 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, compared to 39 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and 37 cents per diluted share in the prior years fourth quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation and a favorable adjustment related to tax reserves.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 were $1,035.7 million, a decrease of 0.4% from net sales of $1,039.7 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was $297.7 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, a decrease of 16.6% from net income of $357.0 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in the prior year.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was a record $330.4 million or $1.57 per diluted share, an increase of 1.5% from net income of $325.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 excludes a tax benefit related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation, and for fiscal year 2008 excludes favorable adjustments related to tax reserves, the sale of Fab 3 and the effect of share-based compensation.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
 
 
Microchip Technology Reports
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2008 Financial Results
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on May 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on May 12, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
I am very pleased to see our business return to a pattern of revenue growth, and meet the upper end of the earnings per share guidance we provided upon entering the quarter, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  The revenue growth was driven by our proprietary products, where Flash microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and analog all achieved record quarterly revenue.  In addition, gross margins achieved another all-time record, reflecting ongoing operational improvements, depreciation roll-off and firm pricing of our proprietary products.
Geographically, the quarter was in line with our expectations, with revenue in both Europe and Americas growing sequentially, while Asia was down sequentially, impacted by the effects of the Lunar New Year holidays in that region, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Revenues from analog and microcontroller products were both very strong in the March quarter, growing sequentially 8% and 4%, respectively, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Sixteen-bit microcontrollers delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth with sales up 12% sequentially, and up 90% from the year-ago quarter.  Shipments of development tools continued at the strongest level weve seen, achieving record shipments of 33,472 in the March quarter, with worldwide cumulative shipments of 632,785.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, With the strong revenue performance in the quarter, inventory levels at March 31, 2008 declined to 112 days, down 2 days from inventory levels at the end of December 2007.  Inventory in the distribution channel also declined, to 1.8 months of inventory.  Overall, we are pleased with the direction of inventory levels in support of our business.
Mr. Parnell continued, Cash generation continued to be an important element of our business model with cash generation from operations representing $99.3 million in the March quarter and $476.2 million for fiscal year 2008.  Cash generation in the quarter excludes the dividend payment to investors of $60.4 million and stock buy-back activities of $173.3 million.  The Board is reaffirming its commitment to return value to shareholders by the increase in our dividend to 33 cents today, an increase of 17.9% from the dividend level in the same quarter of last year.

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2008 Financial Results
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Our book-to-bill ratio in the March quarter was 1.06 and our opening backlog position for the June quarter was up approximately 8% compared to the opening backlog for the March quarter.  However, we continue to watch economic conditions very carefully and monitor the potential impact on our business.  With these factors being considered, we expect sales to be up sequentially 2% to 6% in the June quarter.  EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be 39 to 41 cents and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 43 to 45 cents.

CHANDLER, Arizona  July 24, 2008   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2008.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were a record $268.2 million, up 3.0% sequentially from net sales of $260.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 1.6% from net sales of $264.1 million in the prior years first quarter.  GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 40 cents, essentially flat from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 40 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 11.2% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 36 cents in the prior years first quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was a record 44 cents, up 4.6% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 42 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 12.1% from non-

Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2009 Results
GAAP earnings per diluted share of 39 cents in the prior years first quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.8 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on August 21, 2008 to stockholders of record on August 7, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
I am very proud of the results we achieved despite a very challenging business environment.  Our microcontroller and analog products achieved record net sales levels in the June 2008 quarter.  During the quarter we also achieved net sales growth in all major product lines of Microchip, including record net sales for our 16-bit microcontrollers, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  From a geographic perspective, China was the strongest geography, attaining record net sales levels, with net sales up 18.2% sequentially.  Based on these results, we experienced no measurable adverse impact on our business from the earthquake in China, contrary to the concerns in the market.
Mr. Sanghi continued, We also achieved record non-GAAP gross margins of 61.6% in the June quarter, further evidencing the success of our proprietary business model.  The record net sales as well as gross margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record non-GAAP EPS of 44 cents per share for the period.
We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders sequentially to a record 33.8 cents per share, Mr. Sanghi added.  We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning significant value to our shareholders.
All product lines achieved revenue growth during the quarter.  Our microcontroller product revenues grew 3% sequentially to a record level.  Our 16-bit microcontroller revenues grew 5% sequentially and were up 60% over the same period a year ago, also reaching a record level.  Analog product revenues grew 2.5% sequentially and 8.1% over the year ago quarter to a record level.  Our memory revenues also grew 2.7% sequentially, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Shipments of development tools continued at a strong pace, achieving record shipment levels for the third quarter in a row.  We shipped 34,936 development tools in the June quarter, with worldwide cumulative shipments totaling 667,721.

Fiscal 2009 Results
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Inventory levels continued to decline in the June quarter, with days of inventory now representing 110 days.  Inventory in the distribution channel also declined, representing 32 days of inventory.  Combined inventories declined three days from the March 2008 levels.
Mr. Parnell added, Cash generation continued at a strong level, with cash generation of $118.3 million in the June quarter, prior to the dividend payment and the stock buy back activity.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We achieved record new bookings in the June quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.15, resulting in our starting backlog in the September quarter being higher than what we experienced at the beginning of the June quarter.  However, we continue to be very cautious about the very challenging global business environment including continued weakness in the U.S., the effects of a strong Euro and summer holidays in Europe, and the effects of high energy prices globally.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the quarter ending September 30, 2008 quarter to be flat to up 3% sequentially.  EPS is expected to be approximately 44 to 45 cents on a non-GAAP basis, and EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 40 to 41 cents.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  The favorable tax events are infrequent events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

Fiscal 2009 Results
We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 related to adjustments to tax reserves, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of favorable tax events in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the infrequent nature of these events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Chandler and Phoenix, Arizona, October 2, 2008
 Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ: MCHP) and ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ONNN) today announced that they have sent a proposal to the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) to acquire Atmel for $5.00 per share in cash.  The proposal, which is being led by Microchip, provides a premium of 52.4% to Atmel's closing price of $3.28 on October 1, 2008, and values Atmel at $2.3 billion.
 
The text of the letter that was sent to Atmel's Board of Directors last night follows:
 
October 1, 2008
 
Board of Directors
Atmel Corporation
2325 Orchard Parkway
San Jose, CA  95131
 
Attention:  Steven Laub, President and Chief Executive Officer
 
Dear Steven:
 
We appreciate your having taken the time to meet with Steve Sanghi on September 5 to discuss Microchip's potential acquisition of Atmel.  However, we were deeply disappointed to learn subsequently that the Atmel Board of Directors appears unwilling to consider a transaction at this time under any circumstances.  Given your apparent refusal to engage in transaction discussions, we are writing to you to formally propose an acquisition of Atmel for $5.00 per share in cash.  The acquisition would be led by Microchip and financed in part by the sale of Atmel's nonvolatile memory and RF and automotive businesses to ON Semiconductor.
th
 
Our Offer Would Provide A Significant and Immediate Premium for Atmel Stockholders
 
We believe that this offer, which represents a 52.4% premium over Atmel's closing share price on October 1, 2008, is simply too compelling not to bring to your shareholders.  Although we have a preference to effect a cash transaction, should you feel your stockholders would prefer a form of consideration other than cash, we would consider including common stock as a portion of the consideration.
 
This offer is full and fair and would deliver to your stockholders CY2008 EBIT and CY2008 P/E multiples of 19x and 28x, respectively, based on Wall Street estimates (multiples exclude approximately $60 million of restructuring charges and approximately $25 million of stock based compensation). It offers your stockholders an extremely attractive return based on these and other relevant financial metrics, especially when weighed against the challenges in creating shareholder value that Atmel will face if it continues on a standalone basis.  The transformation plan that Atmel adopted a year and a half ago in the face of a proxy contest brought by its founder is incomplete and continues to face significant execution risks and obstacles:
 
                 
Continued Burden of Lagging and Sub-scale Operating Segments
 Atmel has reiterated frequently that the core tenant of its transformation plan is refocusing its resources on its microcontroller business; however, Atmel's underperforming ASIC and Auto businesses today remain very significant within the company's overall business.  These Atmel segments are significantly below the scale that is necessary for success and they will continue to be a heavy anchor on Atmel's future operating results.
 
                 
Considerable Execution Challenges
 Although Atmel has made some progress to date in disposing of unproductive fab assets and achieved modest improvements in operating results under its previously announced plan, the likelihood and timing of successfully executing on the plan is uncertain at best.  Disposal of unneeded fabs is only the first part of what has been, and will continue to be, a lengthy and difficult strategic shift for Atmel.  For example, even with the changes Atmel has completed to date, the operating margin for its microcontroller business is significantly lagging industry leaders such as Microchip.
 
                 
Deteriorating Macroeconomic Environment
 Even in a stable or growing economic environment, successful execution of the company's announced plan is fraught with uncertainty.  Against this background of significant execution risk, however, you confront a rapidly deteriorating U.S. and global macroeconomic environment that will magnify these risks and increase the likelihood of failure.
 
                 
Lagging Stock Price 
Even with the changes Atmel has announced in connection with its current business plan and the actions it has taken to date, your stockholders have seen a 46% decline in the value of their shares in the last two years.  Both the stocks of Microchip and ON Semiconductor, as well as the overall Nasdaq and SOXX indices, have performed better than Atmel's during this two year period.
 
We believe your stockholders are aware of, and fully appreciate, these risks and challenges confronting Atmel's current course and will find the certain value we are offering for their shares to be an attractive alternative to the otherwise uncertain future facing Atmel.
 
Contemplated Transaction
 
As the lead participant, Microchip would acquire Atmel in a cash merger (subject to Atmel's potential desire for some common stock).  The transaction would be financed with a combination of cash from Microchip and proceeds from the sale of certain Atmel assets to ON Semiconductor.  With respect to the latter, ON Semiconductor would acquire the assets related to Atmel's nonvolatile memory and RF and automotive businesses immediately prior to the merger closing.   ON Semiconductor would finance its purchase using a combination of existing cash resources, borrowings under its existing credit facility and additional financing.
Although not a condition to our offer, Microchip intends to dispose of Atmel's ASIC business upon completing the acquisition or shortly thereafter.  Microchip is confident that it could divest the business and has engaged recently in discussions with a third party who has expressed interest in acquiring it.
 
Compelling Business Rationale that will Benefit Customers and Business Partners
 
It is clear that your businesses would thrive inside Microchip and ON Semiconductor.  Microchip is a leading provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductors, having posted industry-leading financial results and superior shareholder returns.  Microchip has a proven reputation for providing low-risk product development, lower total system cost and faster time to market for thousands of diverse customer applications worldwide spanning the automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial control markets.  And ON Semiconductor is a leader in analog and mixed signal technology and design, with a focus on driving shareholder returns through strong margins and superior cash flow.  ON Semiconductor is well-positioned as a preferred supplier of efficient power solutions to customers in the power supply, automotive, communication, computer, digital and consumer, medial, industrial and military/aerospace markets, with recognized excellence in sales and marketing, supply chain management and world class, high volume, cost effective manufacturing.
 
Your customers and business partners will benefit from a more complete, robust and competitive product offering from a combined company that is better positioned to deliver high-quality design components immediately as well as technology road maps and innovative solutions to help them stay ahead of tomorrow's design trends.
 
Attractive Opportunity for Atmel's Talented Employee Base
 
We also believe the transaction we are proposing represents a uniquely attractive opportunity for Atmel's employees to join with companies better able to respond to marketplace challenges and compete successfully over the long-term.   We have the highest respect for the quality of Atmel's work-force and its culture of innovation.  A significant portion of the transaction value is represented by the talented employees that would continue to work for our companies going forward.  We are therefore ready to discuss with you the best way to structure incentives to retain and motivate your key talent following the transaction.
 
Prepared to Engage in Meaningful Discussions Promptly
 
We have dedicated significant time and resources in evaluating the merits and risks of this transaction and are confident that it can be consummated expeditiously in partnership with your team.  We have reviewed the transaction with our respective counsel and are confident that the transaction will receive all necessary regulatory approvals.   Although we have completed extensive due diligence based on publicly available information, our proposal is of course subject to customary due diligence, as well as the negotiation of definitive transaction agreements (including with respect to ON Semiconductor's additional financing) and the satisfaction of customary conditions to be set forth in such agreements.  We have retained J.P. Morgan to act as our financial advisor and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and DLA Piper as legal advisors.  We and our advisors are available to meet with you immediately to discuss the terms of our proposal and to commence due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documentation for the transaction.
 
We believe now is the right time to pursue the transaction, and we are committed to moving forward on an expedited basis.  Considering the substantial premium and other compelling benefits of this proposal, we are confident that, given the opportunity, Atmel's stockholders and your other
stakeholders will enthusiastically support this offer.  In light of the foregoing, we ask that you engage us in a meaningful and productive discussion about this proposal promptly and with a sense of urgency.  We remain available to meet with you further to continue to discuss the value creation opportunity that the potential transaction represents.  We look forward to your prompt response.
 
Sincerely,

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release, including those regarding Microchip Technology's and ON Semiconductor's proposal to acquire Atmel Corporation, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "intend", "estimate" (and the negative of any of these terms), "future" and similar expressions help identify forward looking statements.  These forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risk and reflect the current expectations of each of Microchip's and/or ON Semiconductor's management, as applicable, and involve subjects that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements because of factors such as: the possibility that Microchip's and ON Semiconductor's joint proposal to acquire Atmel will be rejected by Atmel's board of directors or shareholders; the possibility that ON Semiconductor will not be able to obtain sufficient financing; the possibility that Microchip and ON Semiconductor will be unable to reach agreement on the terms of the sale of certain Atmel assets; the possibility that, even if Microchip's and ON Semiconductor's proposal is accepted, the transaction will not close or that the closing may be delayed; the effect of the announcement of the proposal on each of Microchip's, ON Semiconductor's and Atmel's strategic relationships, operating results and businesses generally, including the ability to retain key employees; each of Microchip's and ON Semiconductor's ability to successfully integrate Atmel's operations and employees; general economic conditions; and other factors described in Microchip's SEC filings (including Microchip's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008) and ON Semiconductor's SEC filings
(including ON Semiconductor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2008).  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, the joint proposal may not be accepted, the acquisitions may not be consummated, the potential benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized, Microchip's, ON Semiconductor's and/or Atmel's operating results and financial performance could suffer, and actual results could differ materially from the expectations described in these forward-looking statements. All information in this press release is as of October 2, 2008.  Each of Microchip and ON Semiconductor undertakes no duty to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
 
Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
Before we begin today, we would like to remind you that during this conference call both Microchip and ON Semiconductor may make some forward-looking statements regarding future events, the proposed acquisition of Atmel, and the future financial performance of Microchip, ON Semiconductor and Atmel. We caution you that these statements involve predictions and that actual events and results may differ materially.
 
We refer you to today's press release of Microchip and ON Semiconductor and Microchip's and ON Semiconductor's most recent 1 0Ks and 1 0-Qs for discussions of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We make these statements as of today, October 2, 2008 and disclaim any duty to update them except to the extent required by law.
 
Now I will briefly describe today's joint announcement then I will walk you through a short presentation regarding the transaction rationale for Microchip. Following that, Keith Jackson will review the transaction rationale for ON Semiconductor. I will then wrap up the prepared comments and executives from both companies will be available to take investor and analyst questions.
 
Microchip and ON Semiconductor today announced that we have sent a proposal to the Board of Directors of Atmel regarding a proposal to acquire Atmel for $5 per share in cash. This proposal which is being led by Microchip implies a premium of 52.4% to Atmel's closing price of $3.28 on October 1, 2008, and values Atmel at $2.3 billion. The full text of the letter to the Board of Directors of Atmel was attached to a press release which was issued this morning.
 
As the lead participant, Microchip would acquire Atmel in a cash merger subject to Atmel's potential desire for some common stock. The transaction would be financed with a combination of cash from Microchip and proceeds from the sale of certain Atmel assets to ON Semiconductor. With respect to the latter, ON Semiconductor would acquire the assets related to Atmel's non-volatile memory and RF and automotive businesses immediately prior to the merger closing. ON Semiconductor would finance its purchase using a combination of existing cash resources, borrowings under its existing credit facility, and additional financing.
 
Although not a condition to our offer, Microchip intends to dispose of Atmel's ASIC business upon completing the acquisition or shortly thereafter. Microchip is confident that it could divest the business and has engaged recently in discussions with a third party who has expressed interest in acquiring it. The ASIC business will be accounted for as an asset held for sale if it is not sold prior to closing.
 
Now I will walk you through Microchip's presentation and after that, I will turn the call over to Keith Jackson. So let's go to the presentation which you have and the second slide is the Safe Harbor. I will let you read the large verbiage of the Safe Harbor statement yourself. I covered a shorter version at the start of this conference call.
 
With that, we will go to page three which is titled transaction summary. Microchip and ON Semiconductor have submitted a joint proposal to acquire Atmel. Microchip will acquire the microcontroller business which had a trailing 12-month revenue of $513 million. And we will acquire the ASIC business which had a trailing 12-month revenue of $496 million. ON Semiconductor to acquire the nonvolatile memory business which had a $385 million revenue in the last 12 months, and they would also acquire the RF and auto businesses, which had revenue of $282 million in the last 12 months.
 
Now Microchip intends to sell the ASIC business either before completing the transaction or shortly thereafter. But it is not a closing condition. The ASIC business will be accounted for as an asset held for sale if it is not sold prior to close. The price in this offer is $5 per share in cash. It represents 52.4% premium to Atmel's closing price on October 1, 2008. Transaction has a total equity value of $2.3 billion on a fully diluted basis. Transaction is expected to be accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full year and the transaction is expected to be accretive to ON Semiconductor's non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full year.
If you go to slide four titled Microchip transaction rationale. This transaction combines complementary businesses of Microchip and Atmel. Atmel has strong momentum in its proprietary AVR architecture and it has a broad product line with 8- and 32-bit solutions; a broad base of technology building blocks including memory, connectivity, touch sense and security. All those businesses will be quite complementary with similar businesses at Microchip.
 
It broadens the market presence. It enhances Microchip's opportunities in the 8-bit segment, it extends Microchip's 32-bit offering and segment opportunities with AVR32 as well as ARM based solutions. And it expands Microchip's fast growing mTouch solution with Atmel's QTouch solutions for touch sensing application.
 
It also drives significant efficiencies through scale, significant opportunities to drive operational synergies across cost of goods sold, SG&A and R&D. It leverages sales channels to broaden reach of MCU products. It will optimize our redundant R&D spending. It will exploit the low-cost manufacturing capabilities of both companies and it will eliminate some redundant G&A costs providing a very, very good transaction rationale for Microchip.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
 
Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
 
The next slide, number five, describes a little bit more of the Atmel's MCU business. So the last 12 months of revenue was $513 million consisting of some AVR architecture-based products and ARM-based products. The compounded annual growth rate from calendar year 04 to calendar year 07 was about 11%, Atmel has 8-bit AVR products, 32-bit AVR products and then ARM-based microcontroller products and it also has the 8051 8-bit product. So those are the various architectures. All or thereabout 100 AVR products in the portfolio, it is a proprietary architecture and a high-performance, low-power, high-core density, flash program memory and our highly integrated circuits are some of the hallmarks of those products.
 
In the ARM-based area based on standard 32-bit ARM7 and ARM9 architectures, our license from ARM and it has a valuable 200 plus MIPS 32-bit flash MCU technology. In the 8051 area, it is based on the standard 8051 CPU and it has 2 kb to 128 kb of embedded flash memory product.
 
If you go to page six which shows the MCU product line synergy, you can see a side by side architectures from Microchip and from Atmel. In the 8-bit area, we have our PIC architecture with PIC1 0, PIC1 2, PIC1 6 and PIC1 8 and Atmel's 8-bit AVR and 8051. All those together provide significant growth opportunity. In the 16-bit area, we have a PIC24 and a dsPIC and in the 16-bit area it is a Microchip strength and it is our fastest-growing 16-bit segment providing significant growth opportunity.
 
And in the 32-bit area, we have PIC32 which was launched less than a year ago so it is much newer and the Atmel's case, they have AVR32 as well as ARM7 and ARM9 and in the 32-bit area, it is the Atmel's strength and together we will have products from ARM architecture, MIPS architecture and AVR32, hence providing significant growth opportunities there also.
 
And in the touch sense technology, Microchip's  one of the Microchip's fastest-growing segment is the mTouch technology and in the case of Atmel  in the case of Microchip, we developed that technology in house in the last few years. And in the case of Atmel, their QTouch technology came from an acquisition of Quantum Research Group in the last year. But those two together provide best in class solutions and a significant growth opportunity for the combined company.
 
With that, I will pass it on to Keith Jackson, President and CEO of ON Semiconductor, who will walk you through slide number seven which shows the ON Semiconductor transaction rationale. Keith?
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
Thank you, Steve. We are very excited at the prospect of acquiring Atmel's nonvolatile memory and RF and automotive businesses. ON Semiconductor has been a strong proponent of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. Based on our recent experiences with the acquisition of the CPU Voltage and PC Thermal Monitoring business from Analog Devices and the acquisition of AMIS Holdings Inc., we believe there are significant synergies that can be harvested for shareholders, customers and employees by consolidating the operations of semiconductor companies focused in similar end markets.
We believe the potential acquisition of the Atmel assets as outlined in the press release this morning is a powerful and compelling business combination for all involved companies and our respective shareholders and customers.
 
ON Semiconductor has taken and will continue to take a disciplined financial approach to acquisitions. Similar to our historical acquisitions, we are interested in assets and businesses that we can purchase at approximately 1 to 2 times trailing 12-month sales and approximately 5 to 6 times EBITDA after the execution of identifiable synergies that can also generate strong free cash flow.
 
We expect that after diligence, we will conclude that the acquired assets of Atmel, which have trailing revenues of more than $650 million meet our strict financial criteria and can be accretive to our shareholders. So based on this information, we would expect that ON Semiconductor's purchase price for the Atmel assets could be up to $1 billion.
 
We expect to finance the acquisition of the Atmel assets through a combination of cash on hand of greater than $410 million at the end of September; cash that we will generate in the period up to closing which we anticipate to be approximately $60 to $75 million per quarter; borrowings of approximately $260 million under ON Semiconductor's existing credit facility and additional financing.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
 
Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
With ON Semiconductor's strong run rate EBITDA and track record of integrating acquisitions similar to the Atmel assets, we are confident that we will be able to obtain any additional required financing even in the current environment. We are in a process of deciding how to structure permanent financing for the transaction on the most attractive terms to ON Semiconductor.
From a transaction rationale standpoint, the proposed acquisition of the nonvolatile memory and RF and automotive product lines will help ON Semiconductor create an automotive and nonvolatile memory leader and extends ON Semiconductor's analog transformation. The product lines ON Semiconductor is looking to acquire also integrate into our existing manufacturing infrastructure. ON Semiconductor also has significant automotive presence with customers in Europe and throughout the world that will complement Atmel's automotive and RF business.
 
ON Semiconductor's sales to the automotive end market are currently running north of $450 million on an annualized basis and can provide Atmel's customers and employees additional scale and resources necessary to succeed in today's challenging global marketplace.
 
The Atmel nonvolatile memory product line broadens our standard product portfolio and technology offering to this marketplace and can benefit from our strong sales force, sales channels and manufacturing capabilities. ON Semiconductor's Gresham Oregon wafer facility can also permit the development of innovative, low-cost RF auto and nonvolatile memory products. ON Semiconductor's low-cost, high-volume assembly and test facilities can also help reduce costs and improve the profitability of the acquired businesses.
 
We further believe our high-volume planning, IT and customer service organization can further enhance the business success of the acquired businesses. We also anticipate operating expense synergies by leveraging ON Semiconductor's automotive design and customer support infrastructure and expect the contemplated transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in the first full year.
 
Over the last three years, ON Semiconductor has acquired significant assets and businesses to accelerate our growth and financial performance. Our experience and success with these acquisitions has encouraged us to pursue this strategy. We are confident we have the people, the processes and the manufacturing assets to make this potential acquisition a big success for ON Semiconductor shareholders, customers and employees.
 
I'd like to turn it back over to Steve now to walk through some of the details of the transaction. Steve?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Thank you, Keith. I will take you now to slide number eight which is titled all cash premium proposal versus the status quo of Atmel's incomplete turnaround plan. Atmel has struggled to execute on its transformation plan. Atmel's strategy continues to include its underperforming ASIC and auto businesses, which do not have the scale to successfully compete in the marketplace.
 
The changes Atmel has implemented have only led to modest improvements in operating results. Operating margin for Atmel's microcontroller business continues to significantly lag behind Microchip. The current competitive and macroeconomic landscape only serve to magnify Atmel's operational challenges.
 
Despite implementing some strategic changes, Atmel's stock has dropped by 46% over the past two years. Over the same period, Microchip and ON Semiconductor have performed significantly better than Atmel.
 
So slide nine, the final slide, says next steps to transaction completion. Microchip and ON Semiconductor are committed to moving forward on an expedited basis to complete the transaction. Microchip and ON Semiconductor are prepared to begin confirmatory due diligence immediately, then commence also the regulatory process. Atmel, Microchip and ON Semiconductor then negotiate and sign merger agreement and ancillary purchase agreement. Then the customary conditions to closing, including receipt of regulatory approvals and then the transaction closes.
 
Microchip and ON Semiconductor are fully committed to completing the transaction and have not ruled out any potential options.
 
With that, operator, will you please open it up for questions?

Craig Hettenbach
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
 
Yes, thank you. Steve, you touched on that Atmel's operating margins significantly lags behind Microchip. Can you also talk about gross margin and then what type of timeframe do you think you can get their margins if you can over time to your corporate average?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, it is too early to be putting specific timeframes on that improvement. Atmel has not allowed us any diligence so far but we believe that with Microchip's assets and many years of track record, we can rapidly improve their operating results to get them closer to Microchip.
 
Craig Hettenbach -
Goldman Sachs - Analyst
 
Okay and then a question for Steve and Keith. Just on the financing and the current state of the financial markets, can you just go into maybe a little more detail in terms of your confidence in being able to secure financing to complete the deal?
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Keith?
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
I will turn that one over to Don Colvin for the ON Semiconductor portion.
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CFO
 
Thank you, Keith. Obviously, it's a surprise to no one that the current markets have their challenges but we are very confident that working with our partner, Microchip, we have a strong cash balance on our balance sheet. We project over $400 million at the end of this quarter; Microchip will have over $1 billion well over that. So together we have a huge amount of cash available. Our business generates  both the businesses generate a lot of cash. The ON business is generating $50 to $70 million, $75 million a quarter of cash on an ongoing basis.
 
We have access to the accordion feature in our existing bank facility for over $200 million and then a whole multitude of other financing sources. We have discussed with our financial advisors and they are really confident that a deal of this quality that adds additional EBITDA to our already strong cash generation should be financable even in the current tough markets. So we faced these similar challenges before when we purchased AMI and we are very confident that we will solve that with this purchase also.
 
Craig Hettenbach
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
 
If I could just quickly follow up. For each company, is there a specific cash balance post this deal that you would like to maintain or at least have on your balance sheet for flexibility?
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CFO
 
Well, since I answered the last time  for ON Semiconductor, we are very comfortable with a cash balance above $150 million. So we have a significant amount of cash available to support this cash generating acquisition.
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
The numbers are very similar for Microchip. We have $1.55 billion of cash on our balance sheet so the financing from outside on our part of the deal is really not an issue.

Chris Danely, JPMorgan.
 
Chris Danely
- JPMorgan - Analyst
 
Steve, can you give us I guess some estimate of how much lower you think the Atmel microcontroller gross and operating margins are versus yours?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, we have not done any diligence at Atmel so the numbers that we have are basically whatever the publicly available numbers are. They have not broken out the gross margins by product segment. But they have broken out the operating margins by product segment and we have those and they are substantially, substantially lower than any of Microchip's numbers are as you know.
 
So we think it represents a very significant opportunity for Microchip to be able to improve those through cost reduction, extended product line, significant synergies, in R&D, in SG&A and in expanded sales channel.
 
Chris Danely
- JPMorgan - Analyst
 
Donald or Keith, can you talk about the gross in operating margins on the RF and auto business versus your own business?
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
Yes, this is Keith Jackson. From the implied data we have publicly, their margins appear to be kind of mid-40s, so very similar to ON Semiconductor's current numbers. And again as we have experienced with our other transactions, we do expect there are some significant synergies very quickly to drive that up. And then over the longer term with our very strong manufacturing base to get this business north of the corporate average on a long-term basis.
 
Chris Danely
- JPMorgan - Analyst
 
Last question, it sounds like you guys went to them with this idea and they said thanks but no thanks. Can you just give us their reasoning why they didn't take it?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I cannot tell you their reasoning but we had a very friendly chat with them and approached them to really do this deal and the answer we got was that the Board of Atmel did not want to do this deal under any circumstances, under any terms at this time. We think our proposal is just too compelling not to take it directly to the shareholders with such a large premium that brings forward the value that Atmel can create over several years and the significant risk that Atmel shareholders have on a go-it-alone plan especially with these challenging economic environments and our proposal brings that value forward. So we thought it was just too compelling not to take it to the shareholders.

Again, Steve, when do you think will have an answer or some resolution on the decision on this offer?
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
We believe that and our preference continues to be really a very friendly negotiated deal with Atmel. And we want their Board and their management to sit down with us to negotiate such a deal. If that can be done immediately, then there is no reason why this transaction could not be signed in the current quarter in the December quarter and then closed in the March quarter.

Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.

Uchechi Orji, UBS.
 
Uchechi Orji
- UBS - Analyst
 
Two questions for you. First, after you have used up  as you mean this was accepted at the higher price and it is a cash deal, how will this affect your dividend policy? Because one of the things that has been interesting is how you pay dividends quarterly for some time now. Will that change?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
It will not change. Our dividend is largely funded by the quarterly cash generation. We are generating over $100 million of cash per quarter. So this really wouldn't change the dividend. It still leaves a very substantial amount of cash on our balance sheet even after paying cash so investors need not be concerned about any changes in dividend.
 
Uchechi Orji
- UBS - Analyst
 
That is one. The second question is one of the things that affected Atmel is some of the facilities they have, particularly in Europe. How do you plan to take this on assuming this passes? I know you haven't done diligence but I think this is fairly obvious on some of the (inaudible) solutions they have to have some manufacturing. What will you do about that? Because I think that is an issue that is not that easy to resolve unless those plants are sold. So is there something you can give us some thought to?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, we are very clear in our announcement that Microchip will sell the ASIC business either prior to the transaction close or soon after. We already have interest on that business and have had discussions with one party and to our knowledge from publicly available information, a fair amount of work that is done in France which is the only remaining European facility  the other facilities all have been sold  does a really large amount of ASIC business. So that really will go with the ASIC business.
 
There is a fair amount of manufacturing which is intertwined in various plants and as we divide the assets between ON Semiconductor and Microchip, we will have a purchase agreement between the two companies to be able to take product from each other as we unwind dollars manufacturing happening in each other's facility over time.
Uchechi Orji
- UBS - Analyst
 
Just one last point. Are there any concerns you may have in terms of the antitrust issues? Certainly the combined marketshare package becomes quite significant but do you think you are within a threshold where that would be a concern?

We do not have any antitrust concerns in this. We have done a significant review of that and we think we will get the antitrust clearance quite quickly.

John Barton, Cowen & Company.
 
John Barton
- Cowen & Co. - Analyst
 
Thank you very much. Steve, I heard your comments that you wanted this to be a friendly negotiation, etc., etc. To some extent it's a little beyond that point by having to publish this letter. I'm curious what your  both Keith and Steve your views are on the importance of retaining the employees that are at Atmel, probabilities of retaining them. And then potentially future dilution particularly in the stock area that we may encounter a year down the road in an effort to repaying them?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, we absolutely made a friendly gesture to Atmel. We have been working on this transaction for some time. We came to this measure only after we got a very clear message from the Board that they were not interested in this transaction at this time under any terms. So you are correct that it has really gone beyond that point. But both Microchip and ON Semiconductor have substantial infrastructures in these products. Microchip understands these products very, very well. We know a lot about the company, its products and its employees and others and we think after the transaction closes, we will be able to retain lots of valuable employees in both companies.
 
John Barton
- Cowen & Co. - Analyst
 
And you think you can do that without substantial stock option grants or the like to lock them up?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I think the stock option grants and retaining grants are  on a $2.3 billion deal, they are not that many meaningful.
 
John Barton
- Cowen & Co. - Analyst
 
Okay. As a follow-up to that, obviously an interesting structure, a portion of the business going ON, a portion going to Microchip and then potentially the ASIC business going elsewhere. You talked about mutual manufacturing agreements between the parties involved, etc. How much challenge do you foresee with respect to personnel that are involved with all those businesses or IP involved with all those businesses being spread across potentially three buyers?
 
And also if I'm not mistaken, some of the stuff that ON would be acquiring would put ON in competition with Microchip directly particularly in nonvolatile. Is there any challenges associated with that that you foresee?

Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
This is Keith Jackson, I will speak up, John. You know we have done this before with acquisitions with manufacturing service agreements. They tend to work very well. Both Microchip and ON are quite good manufacturing operators and really don't see that there is significant issues to be had between them.
 
Relative to the competition comment. It seems that at least from an ON perspective, we are in competition with everybody in the semiconductor industry and it is not something we have shied away from. It is not necessarily a problem or a significant issue for us. So again, we all do foundry business. It's very common to do that with people you compete with and again, I just don't see that as an issue.
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I might add that back in 2001 when we acquired TelCom Semiconductor, there was a supply agreement between TelCom Semiconductor and ON Semiconductor which then Microchip assumed after we bought TelCom. So we supplied them the product at the same time we competed. We still compete with each other on analog business although it is a much smaller business for Microchip and a much larger one for ON.
 
ON Semiconductor also has a pending acquisition of Catalyst Semiconductor which puts them into the serial e squared and NVM business. So we already are headed down the line of competing and they will simply add more to that and I will echo on Keith's comments that in this business we compete with everybody. So that is not an issue.

Thanks for taking my question. I guess first one for Don, why are you willing to pay up to 1.5 times sales when peers with similar operating margins are trading for half that?
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CFO
 
Well, I'm not so sure that companies can be acquired at $0.75 on the dollar of sales, Craig. We have always said to investors and this is exactly in the same range that we acquired AMI last year. We said we are interested in one to two times sales. This is in the sweet spot, 1.5. But more importantly for investors, the cash generation that this asset can bring to ON Semiconductor.
As Keith mentioned, we see this being in line with our corporate average so in the 40s in gross margin, with a much lower operating expense. Obviously we need to do our diligence to get comfortable with that but clearly running our own automotive business and having done extensive due diligence on the Catalyst business give us a lot of market references on where this business can go.
 
So we are highly confident that this will be a very attractive, accretive addition to our line of business. It is something, as Keith mentioned, fits very well into our existing manufacturing infrastructure both using our Gresham facility and our extensive low-cost assembly and test facilities in Asia plus also our existing highly structured automotive infrastructure in Europe.
 
So all these things make us confident that this will be an attractive financial proposition. And as you know, ON Semiconductor has a very attractive tax rate and this also fits into our tax model so we don't expect a big tax leakage. So when we do a bottom up, again only based upon public information that we see adding a nice level of revenue, taking us to a different scale, a nice level of incremental cash contribution after deducting an amount  an appropriate amount for cash interest expense, we see this adding a significant surplus to our earnings and that is why we believe this will be accretive.

It is a very similar estimate. I don't want to get into say what  for Catalyst you are looking at AMI because that I think that is more appropriate. Catalyst was a smaller company. AMI, this acquisition is similar in revenue to AMI and would be a similar based upon our estimates a similar EV to EBITDA multiple based upon what we think we could run the business to what we paid for AMI. Comes in very, very close within a few percent.

How long do you think it takes to requalify the automotive products? And do you intend on moving those within your existing fab network or would you put them into foundries?
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
So our understanding again from public information, they have already announced their intention to sell the wafer fab - the automotive products work in to another party and transition those products to other factories. So I think that groundwork has already been laid. We have a very extensive amount of automotive manufacturing in our Belgium facility and it is at least from all the checks we can do a very similar capability factory and could become a very natural home.

Are you guys prepared to fight a proxy battle?

We are not discussing all of the options at this time. We are leaving them all open but certainly not going to speculate on what could happen. As Steve mentioned, we are hoping this becomes a friendly transaction very quickly.

Keith, I will start with you. Can you just talk qualitatively about this proposed deal, how relative to AMI? Should investors think that it offers the similar type of accretion potential that AMI ultimately looks like it can offer the company?

Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
Yes, I think you can, Craig. As Donald mentioned, ratios are very similar. But more importantly, these businesses fit extraordinarily well into our now even more strong infrastructure for automotive and standard products. Really if anything I would expect the ratios, initial ratios to be similar to AMI but I would expect the gains we can get to be a little quicker because of that now much stronger infrastructure we are plugging them into.

Okay, just 
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CFO
 
Sorry, just one addition here. This is not  we are not  we are buying assets or buying a division so we are not buying the whole company. So the infrastructure, particularly the operating expense infrastructure that will come with this will not be the same as you would get with buying a company. So just to emphasize Keith's last point, Craig.
 
Craig Ellis
- Citigroup - Analyst
 
Yes, that is a good clarification, Don. The follow-up is to you Steve. Steve, as we think about what this transaction would mean to you and the way you think about the opportunity, is this more of an opportunity that helps you grow earnings per share or is this something that really helps accelerate top line growth? How do we think about the real driver for Microchip here?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
It is really both. On the earnings-per-share side, we believe that with Microchip's expertise in the microcontroller business in products, in development tools, in sales infrastructure, in channels, on design wins and technology and others, together with Atmel's products and architecture, we believe it provides Microchip the opportunity to very substantially improve the operating performance of that business, both on gross margin as well as operating margin, which will help accrete the earnings-per-share.
 
And on the growth side of the business, there again the combined intellectual property portfolio of both companies will allow us to post some of our intellectual property on their products and some of their intellectual property on our products, and hence, accelerate the time to market on a number of future products and roadmaps that the joint customers require faster than each company would be able to do by themselves; and get there faster and at the same time get there with higher R&D efficiency by jointly developing the ITs and putting them onto both portfolios.
 
Therefore, we believe that we can accelerate the revenue growth going forward, as well as improve the earnings-per-share on the top of that because of operating efficiency improvement.

Thanks for taking my question. I have a question regarding the value here. So based on what Keith was saying, you are saying that you will see one to two times trailing sales, right? The midpoint of that, that is 1.5 times sales. If I apply that to Atmel's trailing sales, right, that would make Atmel worth around $6.20 per share.

Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
 
So I am a little confused. Are we saying that we think the microcontroller piece is worth less, or am I just confused on how to value this thing?
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor
Corporation
- CFO
 
Donald here. We said we wanted two times sales for the two divisions that we are interested in, nonvolatile memory and RF and auto. Steve mentioned he is after microcontroller, but there is also the loss-making ASIC division and mixture. So you can't apply that to the total lump of businesses.
 
One thing that has come through and I would emphasize to you is that the combination of Microchip and ON Semiconductor brings to the table very significant manufacturing assets and infrastructure which will allow us to accelerate the renewal of the core product lines that we will retain. Steve also mentioned that he is considering and is examining the possibility of selling the troubled ASIC division.
 
So the key thing is that we bring our manufacturing and operating muscle to the businesses that we retain and accelerate through that the regeneration and profit improvement of these businesses. Something that will be incredibly difficult for the company to do on a stand-alone basis particularly in this difficult macroeconomic environment.
 
Edwin Mok
- Needham & Co. - Analyst
 
That is great. So it is fair to say that you believe the ASIC piece is not worth a lot and is essentially less than that one to two times sales range. Is it fair to say that?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, we do not want the speculation on what ASIC business could be worth. We are in discussion with one party privately, we can have more open discussions now once the good news is in public domain. There may be interest from other parties. So I would rather not speculate really what that is worth (multiple speakers) can't put a public price on it.
 
Edwin Mok
- Needham & Co. - Analyst
 
Great. That is fair. One more question regarding the deal. I'm just trying to figure out the timing of  did you guys just approach them yesterday or was that has been in discussion for a period of time and how do we move forward from here? Are you just waiting for them to give you a response or how do we look at that?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
We have had discussions with Atmel over several months now. As the letter clearly stated a date on it, I met with them on September 5. That was not the first meeting, that was the last meeting. And subsequent to that meeting, they came back and absolutely did not want to proceed forward leading us to be making this public offer. We still want a friendly deal. Even though this action has taken it a little bit past that but we expect that Atmel's board and management will sit down with Microchip and ON Semiconductor and work out a very amicable agreement that would be good for all parties.
th
 
Edwin Mok
- Needham & Co. - Analyst
 
Great and one last question. Regarding you mentioned that you are willing to entertain a stock portion of it. How do we view that? Is that a way to get a higher value potentially than the $5 that you are offering right now?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
It is a very full and fair cash offer, but when we meet with Atmel if they would rather have a portion of the purchase price in Microchip stock, we would consider so; a portion of it, we haven't identified how much.

You also should think this way that Microchip has bought well over $1 billion of its stock back in the last six months. Well, well above $1 billion over the last one year, yes, over the last one year. So offering a little bit of the stock back into the transaction would not be an issue for Microchip.

Thanks for taking my question, guys. Steve, can you talk a little bit about how you would handle the management of the product overlap that is going to be created if you were to be successful?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I will hand that to Ganesh Moorthy.
 
Ganesh Moorthy
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - EVP
 
What we see is a very good product line in AVR that complements what Microchip has with our PIC microcontrollers. We expect that the AVR line will continue on, that our set of customers for whom that roadmap is important and we will continue to maintain that roadmap for them. As you look at the 32-bit part of their portfolio, their 32-bit has two architectures, one which is ARM-based, one that is an AVR 32  kind of an offshoot of the AVR for 32-bit.
 
Certainly we see those as being complementary to what Microchip has done with our PIC32 product line which is a MIPS-based architecture. There is a substantially larger 32-bit business that they have today and we expect that for those customers the current products are what we will continue to grow and build.
 
If you look at the product lines, they have strengths in many areas that we don't have. We have strengths in many areas they don't have and we see the two fitting together very nicely building on the portfolio we have and adding to it with their product lines.
 
Doug Freedman
- American Technology Research - Analyst
 
Alright, great. Can you also spend a little bit of time talking  I mean you have mentioned what you are going to do as far as some of the fab assets. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly you think you can assimilate this deal?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
There are two companies involved and I will let Keith answer his question of it. I believe that we understand the microcontroller piece of the business quite well and we would be able to rapidly assimilate the microcontroller part of the deal. We are going to, as Ganesh said, maintain both roadmaps to start using joint intellectual property across the portfolios. So we feel quite comfortable that we will able to assimilate it very, very rapidly.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
 
Oct. 02. 2008 / 9:00AM ET, MCHP - Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor Proposed Acquisition of Atmel Corporation
 
The ASIC is the one that we are not going to assimilate. If it is not sold prior to the completion of the transaction, then we will hold the business as an asset held for sale and essentially put that as a similar line below the operating profit line and the business is largely a breakeven type so it would not change the aesthetics of the P&L in any way. So that is the one we are not going to assimilate and then sell it either before or soon after.
 
Doug Freedman
- American Technology Research - Analyst
 
Can you discuss why the ASIC business is not anyone's interest presently? Why ON or Microchip are not interested in that business?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I will speak for Microchip. We are in the standard business, all of our products are standard field programmable, microcontrollers, every one of our products goes to thousands of customers around the world. Microchip has 63,000 customers around the world. So our expertise is really understanding the common needs of a large number of customers and then developing products which through a broad distribution and direct channels will sell to thousands of customers around the world in various market segments like consumer, industrial, automotive, communication and personal computer segment. Our business is not trying to make one mask set for one customer which is really what ASIC is.
 
So in our business model, we do not consider that business to be scalable. Atmel has now tried for many years and that is the worst performing business in its portfolio also. Having said that, they are a company that does a very, very good job at it. And I think many of those companies will see that as a very valuable portfolio and those are some of the ones we will be talking to. I will let Keith talk from his part of it.
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
On the ON side, the ASIC business really doesn't fit the model I described earlier of having a strong alignment with our current manufacturing supply chain and customer base. So really we are looking for things that will take advantage of the strengths that ON Semiconductor has in a very fast fashion for return not only to our customers but to the  or to our shareholders but to the customers and employees as well. So just really doesn't fit from what we can tell publicly.
 
Doug Freedman
- American Technology Research - Analyst
 
Alright, my last question for you both. In looking at the deal knowing that Microchip and ON Semiconductor both sell to a very broad array of customers, is any of the Atmel customer base additive for either one of you?
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
Well, we are going to find that we do business with 63,000 customers and Atmel does business with thousands of customers. We will definitely find customers where they have won and we did not and customers where we have won and they did not and customers where we shipped to jointly. So I think you are going to find all combinations of that question.
 
Keith Jackson
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CEO
 
And in ON's case although the customer base I believe is very similar, what you do find is that different depths of relationships are present with different companies out there. And we think that actually Atmel has some very good relationships in areas that would make ON a little stronger and vice versa, where we have got some great relationships to open their product base to some of our other customers. So the net of it is we do think we will be stronger at more customers with the combination.

John Pitzer, please go ahead.

Good morning, appreciate taking the call. I apologize  I jumped on a little bit late but I am kind of curious as to why now on the deal? There's a lot of concern in the market place that because of the financial crisis we could be seeing a couple of quarters of fairly poor end demand for technology in general and typically, albeit not always, acquisitions tend to mark the bottom of the cycle, not necessarily occur when the market is concerned that we are going into it.
 
So I guess why now and if we are or go into a period of poor demand because of the financial crisis, how does that change your ability to integrate this acquisition or anything on that front? Thanks.
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
I think that is the best time to do so because that is the best time to retain employees, it's the best time to combine it and possibility to take some of the redundant assets out. It is the best time to get the synergies and use the remaining assets and fully utilizing them when some of the growth opportunities are less available because of the difficult marketplace. So I will turn your question around  I think you are answering your own question a little bit.
 
John Pitzer
- Credit Suisse - Analyst
 
(multiple speakers) Steve, to play devils advocate a little bit. Relative to the valuation you are paying, that perception might change fairly dramatically over the next couple of quarters.
 
Steve Sanghi
- Microchip Technology Incorporated - President and CEO
 
That is represented in a 52.4% premium. So we think that is a very, very handsome premium. In a different time, that premium would have been a lot lower. So I think through that hefty premium, we are paying the fair and full value of it that you would pay in a different time.
 
Don Colvin
- ON Semiconductor Corporation - CFO
 
Just one thing. It's Donald here. We are just completing the last stages of the AMI integration. As Steve stated, this will take a quarter or two at best to complete. So the timing for us is perfect in the sense it will dovetail nicely through the last stages of the AMI and we have some resources available for that. So at a time when Wall Street is telling us don't count for much growth in the near term, it is appropriate that we turn our resources towards earnings enhancement activities like integrating companies and adding to our cash flow and our profitability.
 
John Pitzer

Great, thanks guys. That is the one question I had. I appreciate it.

CHANDLER, Arizona  October 23, 2008  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2008.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were a record $269.7 million, up 0.6% sequentially from net sales of $268.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.3% from net sales of $258.6 million in the prior years second quarter.  GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was 41 cents, up 1.9% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 40 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 48.9% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 27 cents in the prior years second quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were a record 45 cents, up 2.7% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 44 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 18.8% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 38 cents in the prior years second quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation and a charge related to the sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on November 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on November 14, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Despite business conditions being extremely challenging in the September quarter, we were able to grow net sales sequentially to new record levels, with 16-bit microcontrollers and analog products also achieving new record net sales levels, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Geographically, Asia grew approximately 6% sequentially, but net sales in the Americas and Europe regions were both down sequentially.
Mr. Sanghi continued, In the September quarter, we achieved record level non-GAAP gross margins of 61.6%, and non-GAAP operating margins were 35.5%, both indicating the success of our proprietary products.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS in September of 45 cents per share was a record, meeting the high end of our guidance.
Net cash generated in the September quarter was $129.4 million, and for the first half of fiscal 2008 net cash generated was $247.7 million, Mr. Sanghi added.  Our strong cash flow continues to be the cornerstone of our dividend commitment to our shareholders, allowing an increase in the dividend of 9.4% from the level one year ago, to 33.9 cents per share.
We achieved several highlights in our September quarter performance, despite challenging business conditions.  Our 16-bit microcontroller net sales grew 16.8% sequentially and 76.0% year over year, and analog net sales grew 11.7% sequentially and 20.7% year over year, both achieving new record levels.  Our Flash microcontroller net sales also achieved a new record with sequential growth of over 2% and were up 14% year over year, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Market demand for our development tools continued to be very strong, with shipments achieving record levels for the fourth quarter in a row.  We shipped 35,282 development tools in the September quarter, with cumulative shipments exceeding 700,000.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Inventory levels were essentially flat as of the end of September relative to the June quarter, representing 110 days.  Inventory in the distribution channel grew modestly to 35 days of inventory as of the end of September.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Global economic conditions are creating significant difficulties in the market, as consumers and businesses deal with liquidity and credit concerns.  Determining demand levels in the current

climate is extremely challenging, as we endeavor to establish customer order patterns based on market conditions.  Based on current business conditions, we will be taking actions in the current quarter relating to expenses and inventory levels including a two-week wafer fab shutdown and reductions in discretionary and variable costs.  We currently expect net sales in the December quarter to be down 8% to 16%.  Diluted EPS is expected to be approximately 31 to 37 cents per share on a GAAP basis, and diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 35 to 41 cents per share.

expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington is a one-time event in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense and our sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of our sale of Fab 3 in our non-GAAP disclosures is based on the one-time nature of this event.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses;
selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ: MCHP) and ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ONNN) today further commented on their proposal to acquire Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ:ATML) for $5.00 per share in cash, which represents a 52.4% premium to Atmels closing price on the last trading day before announcement of the proposal.  Microchip also announced today that it intends to nominate a slate of highly qualified directors at Atmels next annual meeting of shareholders and that it has received clearance to acquire Atmel under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Chandler and Phoenix, Arizona, November 12, 2008
Steve Sanghi, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Microchip, and Keith Jackson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ON Semiconductor said, Considering the significant value our proposal would create for Atmels shareholders, we were surprised that Atmels Board rejected our offer without engaging in any discussions with us.  We remain fully committed to our offer despite unprecedented weakness and volatility in the equity markets, which have resulted in a decline of 23.6% in the Nasdaq Composite Index since we made our proposal.
We are confident that if Atmel were to enter into discussions and permit us to conduct customary due diligence, we would be able to address concerns Atmel has expressed with the perceived conditionality and complexity of our offer.  Our preference is to engage in a productive dialogue with Atmel, and we are prepared to discuss all aspects of our proposal. However, given the response of the Atmel Board, Microchip intends to take the offer directly to Atmels shareholders by proposing an alternate slate of directors for Atmels next shareholders meeting.
ON Semiconductor noted that it expects to receive antitrust clearance for its proposed acquisition of Atmels Nonvolatile Memory, RF and Automotive businesses after the necessary filings are made upon execution of an acquisition agreement with Atmel.
 
Messrs Sanghi and Jackson continued, While we are not going to engage in a debate on the history of our conversations, we disagree with Atmels version of the events prior to our October 1 proposal.  More importantly, we believe shareholders should be given the opportunity to decide whether they prefer our all cash premium transaction or Atmel managements risky and unsuccessful turnaround plan  a plan significantly challenged by the deteriorating macroeconomic environment.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ONNN) today announced that it is withdrawing from its joint proposal with Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ: MCHP) to acquire Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML).
Phoenix and Chandler, Arizona, November 18, 2008
Keith Jackson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ON Semiconductor said, While we believe that Atmels Nonvolatile Memory and RF and Automotive businesses would be an attractive strategic acquisition, we have decided to withdraw from the proposal due to the unforeseen deterioration in the semiconductor market since we announced our proposal as well as the unprecedented weakness in the financial markets.
Steve Sanghi, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Microchip said, We are disappointed that difficult semiconductor industry and financial market conditions have resulted in ON Semiconductor withdrawing from our joint proposal to acquire Atmel.  As a result of ON Semiconductors withdrawal, Microchip must also withdraw its $5 per share offer for Atmel.  However, Microchip intends to evaluate its potential alternatives for pursuing a transaction without ON Semiconductor.

These forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risk and reflect the current expectations of Microchips management, and involve subjects that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements because of factors such as: the possibility that Microchip will not continue to pursue a transaction with Atmel evaluating its potential alternatives for pursuing a transaction without ON Semiconductor; the possibility that any future proposal by Microchip to acquire Atmel will be rejected by Atmels board of directors or shareholders; the possibility that, even if Microchip commences a future proposal to acquire Atmel, Microchip will be unable to reach agreement on the terms of the sale of certain Atmel assets with third parties, Microchip will not be able to satisfy closing conditions in any definitive agreement, or the transaction will not close
 
or that the closing may be delayed; the effect of the announcement of any proposal on each of Microchips and Atmels strategic relationships, operating results and businesses generally, including the ability to retain key employees; Microchips ability to successfully integrate Atmels operations and employees; general economic conditions; and other factors described in Microchips SEC filings (including Microchips Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008).  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Microchip may not continue to pursue a transaction with Atmel, any proposed acquisition may not be consummated, the potential benefits of any acquisition may not be realized, Microchips and/or Atmels operating results and financial performance could suffer, and actual results could differ materially from the expectations described in these forward-looking statements.

Steve Sanghi, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Microchip Technology Incorporated () will be participating tomorrow, December 4, 2008, in the Credit Suisse First Boston Financial Conference.  The prepared statement of Mr. Sanghi to be delivered at the conference includes the following:
Microchip
As a result of deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry, several negative pre-announcements from other semiconductor suppliers and our own market intelligence, we believe that Atmels business has deteriorated substantially since we initially proposed to acquire Atmel.  Because of these developments as well as ON Semiconductors withdrawal from our proposed transaction, Microchip can no longer justify a purchase price of $5 per share for Atmel.
Microchip continues to evaluate its alternatives with respect to a possible transaction with Atmel, including potential financing sources and disposition strategies for the Atmel businesses Microchip does not want to operate on a long-term basis.  However, given the deterioration of the business and financing environments and the other factors described above, there is no assurance that Microchip will make a new offer for Atmel or, if Microchip does, what the terms of any such offer may be.
Statements in this report, including those regarding Microchips continued evaluation of its potential alternatives for pursuing a transaction without ON Semiconductor, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements because of factors such as: the possibility that Microchip will not continue to pursue a transaction with Atmel; the possibility that any future proposal by Microchip to acquire Atmel will be rejected by Atmels board of directors or shareholders; the possibility that, even if Microchip makes a future proposal to acquire Atmel, Microchip will be unable to obtain the financing necessary to complete a transaction or will be unable reach agreement on the terms of the sale of certain Atmel assets with third parties, Microchip will not be able to satisfy closing conditions in any definitive agreement, or the transaction will not close or that the closing may be delayed; the effect of the announcement of any proposal on each of Microchips and Atmels strategic relationships, operating results and businesses generally, including the ability to retain key employees; Microchips ability to successfully integrate Atmels operations and employees; general economic conditions; and other factors described in Microchips SEC filings (including Microchips Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008).

Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this press release, including those regarding Microchips nomination of directors for election at Atmels 2009 annual meeting, Microchips intention to propose other business at Atmels 2009 annual meeting and Microchips evaluation of its potential alternatives for pursuing a transaction with Atmel, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Words such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, estimate (and the negative of any of these terms), future and similar expressions help identify forward looking statements.  These forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risk and reflect the current expectations of Microchips management, and involve subjects that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements because of factors such as: the possibility that Microchip will withdraw its nomination of directors and its proposed bylaw amendments prior to Atmels 2009 annual meeting; the possibility that Microchip will not pursue a transaction with Atmel; the possibility that any future proposal by Microchip to acquire Atmel will be rejected by Atmels board of directors or shareholders; the possibility that, even if Microchip commences a future proposal to acquire Atmel, Microchip will be unable to reach agreement on the terms of the sale of certain Atmel assets with third parties, Microchip will not be able to satisfy closing conditions in any definitive agreement, or the transaction will not close or that the closing may be delayed; the effect of the announcement of any proposal on each of Microchips and Atmels strategic relationships, operating results and businesses generally, including the ability to retain key employees; Microchips ability to successfully integrate Atmels operations and employees; general economic conditions; and other factors described in Microchips SEC filings (including Microchips Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008).  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Microchip may not pursue a transaction with Atmel, any proposed acquisition may not be consummated, the potential benefits of any acquisition may not be realized, Microchips and/or Atmels operating results and financial performance could suffer, and actual results could differ materially from the expectations described in these forward-looking statements.  All information in this press release is as of December 15, 2008.  Microchip undertakes no duty to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Executive Severance Agreements
 
On December 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved revised forms of Executive Severance Agreements (the Agreements) for use with the executive officers of the Company.  The revisions (i) make technical changes to the Agreements intended to comply with regulations and guidance under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and (ii) modify the Agreements in a manner intended to ensure that the Company can deduct incentive bonus payments to the executive officers under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Prior to amendment, the Agreements provided that following termination of employment under certain conditions (as described below) within the three-month period preceding or at any time following a Change of Control of the Company (the Change in Control Period), the executive would be eligible to receive a percentage of the executives target bonus for which he was or would have been eligible the year of termination or, if greater, the year of the Change in Control, in a lump-sum.  As amended, in order to ensure compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, the Change in Control Period will end twenty-four months following the Change in Control.
The revised forms of Agreements will be entered into with the following executive officers of the Company:
 
Steve Sanghi President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board

The Agreements provide for certain severance benefits to the executive in the event his employment is terminated under specified circumstances, as well as certain benefits upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Agreement).
 
With respect to the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President of Worldwide Sales, if the executives employment terminates for reasons other than Cause (as defined in the Agreement) within the Change of Control Period (as defined in the Agreement), the executive will be entitled to receive severance benefits consisting of the following primary components:

1.
 
It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
 
2.
 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
3.
 
The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain benefits upon a Change of Control and certain  benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control.  These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
 
4.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the Agreement) was originally made and entered into by and between ________________ (the Employee) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company), effective as of ________________, and is hereby amended and restated in its entirety effective as of the last date signed below in order to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
 
 
1.
 
It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
 
2.
 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
3.
 
The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control.  These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.

CHANDLER, Arizona  January 6, 2009  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today provided preliminary results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending December 31, 2008.  Net sales for the third fiscal quarter are expected to be down 29 to 31% sequentially.  Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis for the third fiscal quarter is expected to be approximately 21 to 24 cents, and earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation, losses on trading securities and a benefit from a tax settlement is expected to be approximately 23 to 26 cents.  The preliminary results on a GAAP basis exclude any charges related to the acquisition of Hampshire Company as the financial valuation related to the acquisition has not been finalized as of the date of this release.  Any impact on the December 2008 quarterly earnings from the acquisition of Hampshire Company including charges associated with acquired in-process research and development, amortization of intangibles acquired and purchase price allocations to inventory impacting cost of goods sold will be included in the financial earnings release of Microchip scheduled for January 29, 2009.  No conference call will be held in conjunction with todays press release.
General economic and semiconductor industry conditions have continued to decline since our October earnings call, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  As a result of these conditions, we are continuing with a pay cut for all of our worldwide non-manufacturing employees which was implemented during the December quarter.  We are also continuing actions to reduce manufacturing capacity in our wafer fabrication facilities in the U.S. and our assembly and test facility in Thailand.  These and other actions have been taken to right-size our manufacturing output and keep operating expenses at reasonable levels.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on February 27, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
General economic and semiconductor industry conditions continued to decline during the December quarter, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our December earnings results are reflective of these conditions, and we have taken actions to moderate expense levels and adjust our capacity.  We have instituted pay cuts for all of our employees worldwide, and we are substantially reducing or eliminating discretionary expenses.  We were able to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 by $14 million, or 20%, over the operating expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
We are continuing actions to reduce production levels in our wafer fabrication facilities in the U.S. and our assembly and test facility in Thailand to moderate inventory growth.  We are lowering our production levels by about 40% in the March quarter from peak levels in the September 2008 quarter.  We are charging the underutilization to cost of goods sold to reflect lower than normal production levels.  We are also implementing various other actions to further reduce operating expenses, continued Mr. Sanghi.
We are positioning Microchip to emerge from this economic downturn stronger than our competition by maintaining our focus on product and technology development activities, demand creation initiatives and driving internal efficiencies.  We believe that we will continue to expand our market share in our strategic product lines through our focus on design win opportunities and new product introductions, Mr. Sanghi continued.
Our 16-bit product line revenue was only down 7 percent sequentially and was up 28% from a year ago, which we find encouraging given the depth of the current downturn, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  The number of volume customers in 16-bit continued to grow even in the current environment, and we continue to gain market share and traction in this strategic product line.
Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet grew to 143 days at the end of December compared to 110 days at the end of the September quarter.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors fell by $5.1 million in the December quarter while days of inventory in the
distribution channel increased from 35 days to 41 days.  Despite our actions to reduce our production levels, demand fell so significantly that we were unable to prevent the increase in days of inventory.  We are taking actions that over time should adjust our inventory levels to be more in line with our recent history.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, In light of the unprecedented global economic conditions and limited visibility, Microchip is not providing revenue guidance at this time.  However, for our internal activities, we are planning revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2009 to be approximately $173 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and restricted stock units under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our loss on trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of the acquisition of Hampshire Company are non-cash expenses related to such transaction.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington, our favorable settlement with the IRS, the favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS and the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, are one-time events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which exclude a favorable settlement with the IRS, a favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS, the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, a loss on trading securities, the effect of share-based compensation, the impacts of the acquisition of Hampshire Company and our sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

CHANDLER, Arizona  February 10, 2009  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today announced that it is terminating its consideration of a potential transaction with Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) and is withdrawing the slate of directors it had nominated previously for election at Atmels next annual meeting of shareholders.
The global economy and the semiconductor business environment have deteriorated significantly since Microchip first made an offer of $5 per share on October 1, 2008.  Based on actual results and Atmels first quarter 2009 guidance, Atmels revenue will have declined more than 30% since then and the company is expected to lose money.  In light of the economic uncertainty and the lack of visibility that continues to exist with respect to Atmels business, Microchip is no longer able to put a value on Atmel.  Microchip will therefore terminate consideration of a potential acquisition of Atmel, said Steve Sanghi, President, CEO and Chairman of Microchip.

For the fourth fiscal quarter, our non-GAAP results exclude any gain or loss on trading securities, the effect of share-based compensation, the impact of our recent acquisitions, the acquisition of a patent portfolio license, and acquisition-related expenses relating to the Atmel transaction from which we have withdrawn.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were $903.3 million, a decrease of 12.8% from net sales of $1,035.7 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 was $248.8 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a decrease of 16.4% from net income of $297.7 million, or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 4, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
During the March quarter we saw improvement in the overall business environment, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our total backlog bottomed out early in the quarter and then gradually showed modest improvement through the remainder of the quarter.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was 1.04.  We were pleased to end the quarter modestly better than the midpoint of our revenue guidance given on March 10, 2009 and at the high end of our earnings per share guidance.  The earnings per share achievement was driven by excellent control of our operating expenses.  I want to thank all of Microchips employees for the sacrifices they have made, as well as for their overall diligence in driving the reductions in operating expenses.
 
 
 
Microchip Technology Reports
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2009 Financial Results
In the March quarter, we achieved GAAP gross margins of 48.5% and non-GAAP gross margins of 49.3%, which were slightly lower than our internal plan due to lower utilization levels in our wafer fabrication facilities.  We expect that gross margins bottomed out in the March quarter, and expect improving gross margins in the June quarter.  During the March quarter we ran our wafer fabs at 57% of the peak levels in the September 2008 quarter, which allowed us to reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet to 134 days at March 31, 2009, compared to 143 days at the end of December, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Our 16-bit product line revenue was up 6% sequentially, and was up 21% from a year ago, demonstrating the overall momentum we have in this product line, particularly in this difficult environment, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  We are encouraged by the excellent growth we have continued to see in the number of 16-bit volume customers as we continue to gain market share.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $5.0 million in the March quarter compared to the December 2008 quarter.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors fell by $14.5 million in the March quarter, and days of inventory in the distribution channel decreased from 41 days to 38 days.  With inventory days and dollars declining on our balance sheet and at our distributors, we are continuing to make good progress in right-sizing our inventory position.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, With the backdrop of the continued global economic crisis and limited visibility, Microchip is not providing revenue guidance at this time.  However, for our internal activities, we are planning revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2009 to be approximately $182 million, or up about 5% sequentially.

are subject to mark-to-market adjustments.  We have assumed zero gain or loss on such securities for our internal target for GAAP EPS.  Our internal plan for earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis is approximately 16 cents, excluding the effect of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, non-cash interest expense and any mark-to-market adjustment on the value of our trading securities.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions of Hampshire Company, HI-TECH Software and R&E International are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington, our favorable settlement with the IRS, the favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS, the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, the tax benefit on resolution of a foreign tax matter; the acquisition of a patent portfolio license and our acquisition-related expenses relating to the abandonment of the Atmel transaction are one-time events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

ITEM 1.01     ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
  
 
, we received final approval from the state of Oregon and Multnomah County for an eight year extension of our Strategic Investment Program Contract dated as of August 15, 2002 (the SIP) associated with our semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).  The SIP was first effective for us on July 1, 2003, was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2010 and, as a result of the Amendment to the SIP dated , has been extended to June 30, 2018.  Fab 4 consists of an approximately 140-acre campus, buildings totaling approximately 826,500 square feet (including approximately 200,000 square feet of clean room space) and manufacturing equipment.  We use the facility to manufacture semiconductors.
On June 8, 2009
June 8, 2009
 
The SIP provides us with a partial property tax exemption on Fab 4.  The SIP exemption requires us to pay property tax on the first $100,000,000.00 of assessed value of Fab 4; the $100,000,000.00 taxable base increases each year by three percent.  To maintain the SIP, we must comply with certain requirements including:
 
  meeting certain minimum employment levels in each of the years covered by the SIP; and
  complying with a first source hiring agreement regarding hiring of employees at Fab 4.
A copy of the Amendment between us, Multnomah County, Oregon and the City of Gresham, Oregon is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report on Form 8-K.

City of Gresham Contract No. 1909
Amendment No. 1
 
This Amended Agreement is by and between Multnomah ), the City of Gresham (the City) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP), 2355 West Chandler Blvd., Chandler, Arizona 85224-6199.
County (the County
 
I.     RECITALS.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amended Strategic Contract - 1 of 24
Investment Program
 
Now therefore, in consideration of the following mutual promises, the parties agree as follows:
 
II.           LIMITATIONS ON QUALIFICATION OF PROJECT FOR EXEMPTION; FUTURE EXEMPTIONS.
 
A.           Limitations.
 
The Project consists of the purchase, improvement and equipping of FMIs facilities in Gresham, Oregon.  Only $490 million of assessed value of the Project will be eligible for the exemption, and any assessed value at the Project during the term of this Agreement which exceeds $490 million shall not be eligible for the SIP exemption.  The Project shall receive the SIP exemption for fifteen fiscal years, commencing with County fiscal year 2003-04, and this Agreement and MCHPs SIP partial tax exemption shall terminate on June 30, 2018.
The maximum investments which MCHP expects to make, and the tax years in which those investments will appear on the tax rolls, are estimated to be:
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 2 of 24
 
 
 
 
C.           Verification of Factual Assumptions.
 
 
This sum shall be paid to the County within six months following the approval of the Amended SIP Agreement by the Board of County Commissioners.
 
III.           STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OF MCHP.
 
A.           Payment of CSF.
 
1.         Amount.
 
For each year in which MCHP receives the Property Tax Abatement, MCHP shall pay to the County a Community Service Fee (CSF), as provided by ORS 285C.609(4)(b)(B), equal to 25 percent of the property taxes abated in such tax year, but not exceeding $2 million.
 
2.         By November 15.
 
The CSF payment shall be made to the County Finance Manager no later than November 15 of each year, commencing with November 15, 2003.  However, MCHP shall not be required to pay the CSF before ten business days after MCHP receives the invoice described in Section III.A.3, below.  
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 3 of 24
 
Payment shall be made based on an invoice submitted by the County to MCHP in such form and according to such method as shall be agreed to by the parties prior to
November 15 of the tax year in which the Project is assessed and taxed. The payment shall be sent to:
 
 
3.         Statement 30 Days in Advance
 
The County shall provide MCHP with a statement of the CSF due no less than 30 days prior to the due date.
 
4.         Adjustments
 
If the assessed value of the Project is adjusted after November 15 of any tax year in such a manner that property taxes due from MCHP for that year are reduced, and the reduction reduces the CSF for that year, the County shall pay the amount of the reduction to MCHP, together with interest at the rate established by law for tax refunds (ORS 311.505(2)) from the date of payment of the CSF.  If the County does not pay the amount by November 10 of the following year, MCHP may withhold the unpaid amount, plus interest as provided in this Section, from subsequent CSF payments due from MCHP under this Agreement.  If the remaining CSF payments due from MCHP are less than the amount owed by the County to MCHP under this Section, the County shall pay the amount due to MCHP not later than December 15 of the year following the year in which the reduction occurs.  An appeal of the assessed value does not defer the payment of the CSF.  The CSF shall be paid as set out in paragraph 2 above.  Any adjustments based on the outcome of the appeal shall be in accord with this paragraph.
 
5.         Nonpayment of CSF.
 
In compliance with ORS 307.123(b)(6), if MCHP fails to pay the CSF fee required by ORS 285C.609(4)(b)(B), by the end of the tax year in which it is due, the tax exemption shall be revoked and the property shall be fully taxable for the following tax year for which the fee remains unpaid.  It is agreed that MCHP shall pay the CSF for a total of fifteen (15) years.
 
B.           First Source Agreement.
 
To target the Countys unemployed and underemployed population and comply with the requirements of ORS 285C.606(5), MCHP entered into an Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement (FSA), with the Multnomah County or its designated contact agency(s) as
defined in OAR 123-070-1100.  MCHP will execute the template FSA adopted by the County and the City for the Gresham Strategic Investment Zone # 1.  An executed copy of the new FSA is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 2.  Compliance with the terms of the new FSA is a requirement of this agreement.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 4 of 24
 
 
In consideration of the Countys and Citys actions to approve a SIP exemption for the Project, MCHP agrees to fill the role of an exemplary corporate citizen in Multnomah County as provided in this Agreement.  Such a citizen helps prepare the unemployed and underemployed, including the emerging workforce from local high schools, community colleges, and universities, for entry level jobs which provide career paths, family wages, and excellent benefits, including childcare referrals and negotiations of group rates, which help assure the success of the employee in those jobs.  An exemplary corporate citizen also leads the business community by progressing toward a goal to have no negative impact on the environment through state-of-the-art transportation and environmental programs.  And, an exemplary corporate citizen positively affects the educational and economic well-being of the community in which it resides by directing its efforts and resources to the benefit of its communitys citizens and businesses.  By meeting the performance requirements specified in this Agreement, MCHP will meet its responsibilities as an exemplary corporate citizen.
 
A.           Hiring, Wages, Benefits, Training and Retention.
 
County goals:
 
To create long term jobs with family wages, benefits and working conditions for County residents or creation of a full spectrum of jobs for residents of Multnomah County who are unemployed or underemployed, with a clear career track from entry-level jobs to family wage jobs.
 
To provide educational opportunities to enhance upward mobility for both technical and management roles.
 
To minimize the number of contracted on-site jobs that pay low wages.
 
MCHP acknowledges these County goals and agrees to take the following actions in support of those goals:
 
1.         Local Hiring.
 
MCHPs goal is to hire many local candidates.  MCHP will focus on previous employees who have directly related semiconductor fabrication experience.  Once MCHP has exhausted those rehiring possibilities, MCHP will work with WorkSystems, Inc. or other provider appointed by the County, to find more qualified candidates.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 5 of 24
 
2.         Retention of Existing Jobs and New Hires.
 
a.         Number of Jobs.
 
MCHP currently projects that, at a minimum, the following jobs will be retained or created at the Project (totals refer to the total number of jobs at the Project including jobs retained and jobs created) in the following calendar years:
 
The preceding table shows the minimum number of jobs which MCHP expects it will create at the Project.  If economic conditions support investments in the Project at the level shown in Section II.A, it is expected that jobs at the Project will exceed the minimum number of jobs shown in the preceding table.  MCHP will report all jobs at the Project in accordance with Section V.
 
b.           Timing.
 
MCHP shall create the total number of jobs at the Project set out in the preceding chart in each of the years shown in that chart.  Each years minimum number of jobs, as set out in the Total row of the chart shown above, shall be created by December 31 of the relevant year.  A new job is created when someone is hired as a regular full-time employee.  The number of employees may be deferred or reduced temporarily due to
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 6 of 24
 
 
delays in commissioning equipment, inability of MCHP to recruit qualified employees, or economic circumstances, either in general or specific to MCHP, leading to a requirement for a deferral in recruitment or a reduction in employment.  If such a deferral or reduction is necessary, MCHP shall notify the County in writing, specifying the reason for the deferral or reduction, the amount of the deferral or reduction, and the expected duration of the circumstances giving rise to the deferral or reduction.  If the County believes that MCHP has deferred or reduced maintaining and creating jobs in violation of this Agreement, the County may commence dispute resolution proceedings under Section VII.A of this Agreement.
 
c.           Additional Employment.
 
Total Project employees may be greater than those indicated in Section IV.2.a.  While MCHP cannot commit to increases, the commitment to the Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement attached as Exhibit 2 of this Agreement shall apply throughout the term of this Agreement.
 
3.         Temporary Employees.
 
MCHP anticipates it will use temporary employees in production tasks only to meet peak production loads and to cover temporary and extended leaves of absence.  A Category One temporary employee, as defined in paragraph 5, below, shall not hold a position longer than six months unless the employee is filling a vacancy created by extended medical leave or a statutorily protected leave.
 
4.         Retention of Employees.
 
MCHP intends to hire and retain employees for many years, and to provide its employees with multiple opportunities to move progressively through the MCHP corporate organization with increasing responsibility.  To carry out these intentions, MCHP shall maintain during the term of this Agreement a transfer policy and an internal posting policy which are substantially similar to the transfer policy and internal posting policy which are attached as Exhibit 3 to this Agreement.
 
It is the intent of the parties that employees hired in new jobs be retained either in the initial position or in progressively more responsible positions within MCHP.  Beginning with the end of fiscal year 2003-04, MCHP shall demonstrate that at least 70% of all of its regular full time employees at the Gresham facilities except those described in the next sentence are retained for at least two years. 
The following employees will not be counted: (1) those terminated for cause; and (2) those that voluntarily terminate employment other than for reasons of inadequacy of child care, transportation or housing.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 7 of 24
 
 
5.         Advancement of Category One Employees.
 
MCHP will source as many Category One Employees as practicable for hire into entry-level production operator jobs.  MCHP currently provides a weeklong training class for all production operators.  In addition, MCHP continually offers in-house training and certification levels to improve performance and employee output.  MCHP shall maintain these programs or substantially similar programs during the term of this Agreement.  Category One Employee means a person holding a job which requires less than a two year college degree or certificate and which is not highly technical in nature.
 
In addition, MCHP shall:
 
 
 
 
6.         Promotional Practices.
 
Microchips practice is to promote approximately 10% of the indirect labor force once per year to the next grade level responsibility. Approximately 40% of the Gresham facilities will be direct labor employees.  Once Microchip places an entry level or category one direct labor employee into grade 90, the following chart illustrates their path.
 
    90---92 - First year promotion
92---94 - Second year promotion
94---96 - Third year promotion
 
Once a Category One employee has reached grade 96 they have had a promotion every year for three years and they have reached the highest grade available.  To continue advancement an employee must take on additional
responsibilities such as supervision or follow a technical path toward engineering.

Program Contract - 8 of 24
Investment
 
Microchip provides tuition reimbursement as described in Exhibit 5 up to $10,000 a year for education.  Microchip commits to continue with this level of promotions per year to the extent economic conditions permit, for all employees whose job performance justifies promotion.
 
Direct labor refers to anyone who touches the product or works on the wafer process.  Direct labor positions are classified as production specialists whose costs are included in MCHPs cost per wafer analysis.  Indirect labor refers to any labor positions except direct labor.
 
7.         Wages.
 
MCHP represents that its current wage structure, including base pay, bonus and stock option grants, are competitive with current industry standards. MCHP will continue to maintain competitive wages, and to compare its wages to the Radford Benchmark Survey annually, or its equivalent.  A chart showing wages, benefits, shift differential, and overtime is attached as Exhibit 6.  MCHP commits to reviewing the Radford Benchmark and making any changes to salary ranges that apply, provided that economic conditions allow for such increases in salary ranges.
 
8.         Employer Paid Benefits.
 
a.         In General.
 
MCHP intends to fulfill its role as an exemplary corporate citizen by providing an attractive and competitive benefits package which enables MCHP to recruit and retain qualified employees.  MCHP acknowledges that provision of excellent, competitive benefits is vital, not only to achieving MCHPs corporate objectives, but also to achieve the Countys goals.
 
b.         Specific Benefits.
 
MCHP currently provides all existing US employees at other locations with the benefits described in Exhibit 7 attached to this Agreement.
 
During the period of property tax exemption, MCHP may have to modify its benefits package in order to maintain costs in response to industry or economic conditions or to remain competitive.  The cost to MCHPs employees is the same for all employees regardless of job title or income level.  Employees may choose to insure only themselves, employee plus spouse or employee plus family.  Also included in the attached as Exhibit 7 is a cost analysis for benefit cost for the benefit plan year of May 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010.
 
MCHP shall report the benefits it provides for employees at the Project, and, prior to making any substantial reductions in MCHPs aggregate benefits package, MCHP shall provide reasonable notice to the County.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 9 of 24
 
 
During the period of the partial property tax exemption, MCHP shall provide health insurance at least comparable to that provided under  the Oregon Health Plan (OHP).
 
 9.        Child Care.
 
MCHP will work in good faith to attempt partnership relationships with local childcare facilities to provide discounts for MCHP employees.  MCHP will provide a link to Oregon childcare commission website (http://findit.emp.state.or.us/occc/) on its internal website to facilitate employee access to childcare information.  
 
B.           Transportation.
 
County Goal:
 
To encourage employees to use transit, carpools, vanpools, or alternative modes of transportation.
 
MCHP acknowledges this County goal and agrees to take the following actions in support of this goal:
 
MCHP shall encourage use of alternative modes of transportation by maintaining its current Trip Reduction Program, or a substantially similar program.  MCHPs current Trip Reduction Program is described in Exhibit 8 attached to this Agreement.
 
C.           Infrastructure and Public Services.

MCHP proprietary information contained in the reports and documents submitted by MCHP to the County in support of the report is, and shall be, submitted in complete confidence.  County shall treat MCHPs proprietary information in a confidential manner.  The parties agree that any such proprietary information is exempt from public disclosure under, and the County agrees to assert in connection with any public records request that, such information is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law, ORS 192.502(4).  This Agreement is MCHPs written request  for confidentiality and is the Countys assurance that it will treat MCHPs documents as confidential.  The County acknowledges that MCHP documents that contain proprietary information may give competitors an undue advantage, and, therefore, that such documents are also entitled to nondisclosure protection under ORS 192.501(2).  Additionally, employee survey information of a private nature is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(2) and 192.501(5).

Agreement.  For example, the portion of the report on compliance with the Countys environmental goals may be sent to DEQ for review.
The confidentiality of the MCHP documents shall extend to such documents in the hands of all other governmental agencies and the County shall advise the other governmental agencies of the confidentiality obligation when submitting MCHP documents to such other governmental entities. 
ORS 192.502(9) contemplates
continued confidentiality for documents transferred by a public body to another public body.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 13 of 24
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MCHP shall not be required to report information to the County in a manner which violates the privacy rights of MCHPs employees.  If the County discloses any information provided by MCHP to the County pursuant to this Agreement in any manner which violates the rights of any person or entity, the County shall indemnify and hold MCHP and its agents, directors, officers or employees harmless from and against any claim made against MCHP or its agents, directors, officers or employees based on the disclosure of that information by the County, including costs of attorneys fees at trial and on appeal.

B.           Force Majeure.

It is the intent of the parties that good faith efforts will be made to comply with all the terms of this Agreement.  However, in such a large Project, it is difficult to anticipate all contingencies with accuracy.  In a spirit of fairness and recognizing the cyclical vagaries of business, the County and City agree that variance from numerically ascertainable terms of this Agreement by a plus or minus 5% will not constitute a failure of MCHP to comply with this Agreement. However, the variance is not cumulative.

The following sanctions shall apply if a Breach occurs:
 
1.             Failure to Pay.

Payment by MCHP shall not constitute a waiver by MCHP of any matter in dispute.  If the dispute is resolved in favor of MCHP, the County shall refund the amount of overpayment to MCHP, with interest, within 30 days after the dispute is resolved.
the delinquent amount; and, (2) if the payment is made more than 45 business days after the payment is due and written demand has been made to MCHP for payment, the County shall be entitled to receive a penalty of one hundred percent (100%) of the delinquent amount.

If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to meet the job creation or job retention requirements of Section IV.2.a of this Agreement, MCHP shall pay an amount equal to twice the average gross annual salary plus benefits for operators and technicians in the year of the breach for every job not created or job not retained.
 
3.             Failure to Use FSA.

If MCHP fails to act in good faith to meet its obligations under the FSA, and the failure results in effective abandonment of the FSA by MCHP, MCHP shall pay 75 percent of the Property Tax Abatement for each year the abandonment continues.  It shall not constitute an abandonment if MCHPs failure is due to nonperformance by the County of its obligations under the FSA.
 
4.             Failure to Meet Reporting Requirements.
 
If MCHP fails to meet reporting requirements of Section V of this Agreement, MCHP shall pay twice the amount necessary to have an auditor investigate and prepare the report, or any portion thereof which has been omitted.

Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
 
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $192.9 million, up 11.4% sequentially from net sales of $173.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 28.1% from net sales of $268.2 million in the
prior years first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, up 23.4% from GAAP net income of $22.0 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 62.8% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $35.0 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, up 25.4% from non-GAAP net income of $27.9 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 57.6% from non-GAAP net income of $82.6 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  Our non-GAAP results exclude any gain or loss on trading securities, the effect of share-based compensation, the impact of our recent acquisition activities, the acquisition of a patent license and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures associated with the adoption of FSP ABP 14-1, .  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 3, 2009 to stockholders of record on August 20, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
During the June quarter we saw a steady improvement in the overall business environment that enabled us to exceed our revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and inventory guidance we provided in early June, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter was 1.18, resulting in our opening backlog position for the September quarter being significantly higher than our backlog entering the June quarter.
In the June quarter we achieved GAAP gross margins of 50.0% and non-GAAP gross margins of 51.4%.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up over 200 basis points from the March quarter and we expect significant gross margin improvement again in the September quarter, continued Mr. Sanghi.

Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
Our microcontroller businesses performed well in the June quarter and revenues were up 11.9% sequentially.  Our 16-bit microcontroller revenues were up 15.7% sequentially and 33.3% year-over-year, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  We shipped a record 35,608 development systems in the June quarter, and have now exceeded 800,000 in cumulative development tool shipments.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $17.6 million in the June quarter compared to the March 2009 quarter.  We greatly reduced the days of inventory on our balance sheet, ending June with 108 days of inventory, 26 days lower than the March 2009 balance.  In the June quarter, days of inventory in the distribution channel were flat to the prior quarter at 38 days.  Our inventory is in a very good position to allow us to ramp production activities to be in line with anticipated demand levels.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the June quarter our cash, short-term and long-term investment position was essentially flat, dropping by only $2.6 million.  We expect our cash and investment position to increase in the September quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Despite the continued weakness in the global economy, we are seeing improving trends in Microchips business and our overall visibility.  We expect revenue for the September quarter to be up between 7% and 11% sequentially.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related acquired inventory valuation cost and intangible asset amortization, other acquisition-related expenditures, non-cash interest expense, gains and losses on trading securities, other non-recurring items in our business and the related income tax implications of these items.
 
 
 
Microchip Technology
Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. 
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our
budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Amendments to 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
On August 14, 2009, the stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved an amendment and restatement of the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan) to (i) modify the automatic grant provisions with respect to equity compensation for non-employee directors to provide for annual awards of options and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), rather than just options, and to provide for a one-time award of RSUs to serve as a retention mechanism and (ii) revise the definition of "performance goals" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  As amended, the Equity Plan provides for the following equity compensation for our non-employee directors (a) on first appointment as a director, an initial grant of an option to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock and $60,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date), each subject to four-year vesting, (b) an annual grant of an option to purchase 3,000 shares of common stock subject to vesting over 12 months and $30,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date) subject to two-year vesting; and (c) for non-employee directors who as of the 2009 annual meeting have served as our director for at least five years, a one-time grant of $100,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date) subject to four-year vesting.  
The amendment and restatement was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on June 1, 2009.
The purpose of the change in equity compensation for our non-employee directors is to enable us to continue to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors.  The purpose of the amendment to the definition of "performance goals" under the Equity Plan is to give the Compensation Committee more flexibility in structuring equity compensation arrangements that will qualify as "performance based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
A copy of the Equity Plan, as amended and restated, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

to determine whether and to what extent Awards or any combination thereof, are granted under the Plan;
 
(4)
 
to determine the number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent units to be covered by each Award granted under the Plan;
 
(5)
 
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
 
(6)
 
to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted under the Plan.  Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options or SARs may be exercised or other Awards vest (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
 
(7)
 
to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;
 
(8)
 
to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;

The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
 
(12)
 
to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards; and

The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 19 of the Plan.

If an Option or SAR becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change of Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
Stock Options and SARs
 
(2)
 
.  In the event of a Change of Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit award shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.

equivalent thereof) which would not otherwise be vested.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
 
20.
 
.  The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.

Such stockholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule or regulation.
Stockholder Approval
 
(c)
 
.  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
22.
 
.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a)
 
.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of the Award or the issuance and delivery of such Shares (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b)
 
.  As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
23.
 
.
Liability of Company
 
(a)
 
.  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority

(b)
 
.  If the Awarded Stock covered by an Award exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan without additional stockholder approval, such Award shall be void with respect to such excess Awarded Stock, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 21(b) of the Plan.
Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares
 
24.
 
.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

Reports Second Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
 
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $226.7 million, up 17.5% sequentially from net sales of $192.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down approximately 16% from net sales of $269.7 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter.  GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $44.5 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, up 62.5% from GAAP net income of $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 41.3% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $53.2 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, up 51.9% from non-GAAP net income of $35 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 36.3% from non-GAAP net income of $83.5 million, or 45 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter.  Our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures associated with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, which requires us to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Debt with Conversion and Other Options  Cash Conversion,
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on December 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
During the September quarter we experienced strength in all geographies and product lines, allowing us to exceed our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively in early September, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
We achieved GAAP gross margins of 54.4% and non-GAAP gross margins of 55.5%.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up over 400 basis points from the June quarter, and we expect another 150 to 200 basis points of gross margin improvement in the December quarter as we continue to increase production levels in our factories in response to improving business conditions, continued Mr. Sanghi.

Reports Second Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
Our microcontroller business delivered excellent results and revenue was up 16.6% sequentially, and we shipped a record 38,086 development tools.  Our 16-bit microcontrollers posted a very strong sequential revenue growth of 49.1%, as well as a 70.3% growth from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business executed on all fronts and revenue grew an exceptional 25.5% sequentially.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $5.4 million in the September quarter compared to the June quarter.  Inventory days declined from 108 days at June 30, 2009 to 96 days at September 30, 2009.  Days of inventory at our distributors remained flat to the June quarter levels.  We have aggressively increased our manufacturing output so that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the September quarter our cash, short-term and long-term investment position increased by $34.6 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $62.1 million.  We expect our cash generation to remain strong for the balance of fiscal year 2010.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business and excellent execution by our employees.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter was 1.15, resulting in our opening backlog position for the December quarter being significantly higher than our backlog entering the September quarter. While there are fewer shipping days in Europe and the Americas this quarter, based on the improved visibility and general business conditions, we expect revenue to be up 4% to 8% sequentially.

Calendar Year 2010 Internal Plan:
In order to provide more insight into our business, Microchip is providing information about our internal plan for calendar year 2010.  It reflects the results we expect from our multi-year demand creation activity that has generated a large number of new designs.  Many of these designs are with new customers in emerging markets and applications that are outside our traditional core areas, which we believe will result in increased market share.
 
 
 
 
Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our recent acquisition activities and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Item 1.01      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Agreement and Plan of Merger with SST
On February 2, 2010, Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Microchip), Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., a California corporation (SST), and Sun Acquisition Corporation, a California corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement).  The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of SST by Microchip by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into SST, with SST being the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, SST would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip (the Merger) and each share of SST common stock (other than those shares owned by SST and with respect to which dissenters rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount of $2.85 per share, without interest.  Each outstanding option or other right to purchase SST common stock (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and the holder of such option or right shall be entitled to receive, subject to any required withholding taxes, an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of SST common stock subject to such option or right and (y) the excess, if any, of $2.85 over the exercise price per share of such SST option or right.
 
The Boards of Directors of Microchip and SST have approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SST.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of Microchip, SST and Merger Sub, including among others, (i) covenants by SST concerning the conduct of its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a covenant by SST that, subject to certain exceptions, the Board of Directors of SST will recommend to its shareholders adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) a covenant that SST will not solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowing facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to or that would be reasonably expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Microchip and SST and further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances SST may be required to pay Microchip a termination fee.  Under specified circumstances, SST may be required to reimburse certain of Microchips expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.  Microchip plans to file a copy of the Merger Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for its third quarter ended December 31, 2009.  We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement for a more complete understanding of the transaction.

As separately announced today by SST, SST has terminated its previously announced merger agreement prior to entering into the definitive agreement with Microchip.  
CHANDLER, Arizona  February 3, 2010  (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductors, announced today that
 
The acquisition has been approved by the Boards of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2010, subject to approval by SSTs stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 
SSTs Superflash technology and extensive patent portfolio are critical building blocks for advanced microcontrollers, said   This acquisition enables Microchip to gain earlier access to SSTs advanced technologies, as well as the ability to customize technology variants that can give us an advantage over competing technologies.
Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.
 
We believe this is an attractive transaction for SSTs stockholders, as it presents a significant premium to the prior transaction and requires no external financing, continued Mr. Sanghi.  We look forward to completing this transaction early in the second calendar quarter of 2010.

Reports Third Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
During the December quarter we experienced strong growth in all geographies and product lines, which resulted in us exceeding the revenue, gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively in late November, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, up 350 basis points from the September quarter, and we expect another 75 to 125 basis points of gross margin improvement in the March quarter as we continue to see the benefits from increased production levels in our factories in response to improving business conditions.  We now believe that we are positioned to reach our previous record high non-GAAP gross margin of 61.6% by the end of fiscal year 2011, continued Mr. Sanghi.
 
Our microcontroller business delivered excellent results; revenue was up 10.0% sequentially and we shipped a record 41,492 development tools.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10%, as well as 101.4% growth from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 14.1% sequential growth and exceeded an annual revenue run rate of $100 million for the first time in Microchips history.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Due to the much stronger than expected growth in revenue and despite the significant ramp in manufacturing output, our inventory at 99 days remains well below our internal target of 115 days."
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the December quarter, our cash and investments position increased by $26.9 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $62.5 million.  We expect our cash generation to continue to be strong in the March quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business in the December 2009 quarter.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the December quarter was 1.12, providing us with excellent visibility.  We started the March 2010 quarter with a record high opening backlog.  On the other hand, the Lunar New Year holidays will have an adverse seasonal impact on our business in Asia.  Taking all these factors into consideration we expect revenue to be up 3% to 7% sequentially.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

CHANDLER, Arizona  February 23, 2010  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductors, today announced that it entered into an amendment to its February 2, 2010 definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI).  Under the revised terms, SST shareholders would be entitled to receive $3.00 per share in cash compared to $2.85 per share prior to the amendment.  This amendment was in response to an offer made by another party to SSTs Strategic Committee on February 19, 2010.
 
The $3.00 per share represents an approximate 42.8% premium to the amount that the holders of SST common stock would have received under the previously announced merger agreement between SST and Technology Resources Holdings, Inc., and an approximate 61.3% premium to the closing price per share of SSTs stock on November 12, 2009, the last day of trading prior to the announcement of the execution of the definitive merger agreement with Technology Resources Holdings, Inc.  
The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2010, subject to approval by SSTs stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 
We continue to be excited about this transaction and believe that it remains attractive for both parties for all of the financial and technological reasons that we earlier stated, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  We're also pleased to add SST's talented employees to our team, continued Mr. Sanghi.

Agreement and Plan of Merger with SST
On March 8, 2010, Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Microchip), Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., a California corporation (SST), and Sun Acquisition Corporation, a California corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip (Merger Sub), entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment) to their February 2, 2010 Agreement and Plan of Merger and its February 22, 2010 First Amendment (the Merger Agreement).  The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition by Microchip of SST by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into SST, with SST surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip.  Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the aggregate consideration payable by Microchip to SSTs shareholders in connection with the merger has been increased from $3.00 per share to $3.05 per share, without interest.  The termination fee payable by SST in certain circumstances has been increased from $10,120,624 to $10,300,000 (the Termination Fee).
In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, on March 8, 2010, Microchip purchased 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of SST for $58,401,854.45 (the Issued Shares).    The Issued Shares are subject to certain rights and obligations as set forth in the Second Amendment. Microchip has agreed that, following the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in favor of a superior proposal, Microchip will vote all or an agreed portion of the Issued Shares in favor of any such superior proposal or any subsequent superior proposal, depending on the identity of the party making the proposal to be voted on, if requested to do so by SST and so long as SSTs board of directors recommends such proposal.  Also, Microchip has agreed that its total profit in any such superior proposal or subsequent superior proposal from both receipt of the Termination Fee and any subsequent disposition of the Issued Shares will not exceed 1.286 times the Termination Fee. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, at any time and from time to time thereafter until the 18 month anniversary of the issuance, Microchip has the right, but not the obligation, to require SST to purchase the Issued Shares at a price of $3.05 per share. Finally, Microchip has agreed not to dispose of the Issued Shares for 18 months unless it does so pursuant to a transaction (i) with SST or its subsidiaries, including the right just described, (ii) in which the acquiring person agrees to be bound to the same voting requirements regarding the Issued Shares as Microchip has agreed to, (iii) in which SSTs stockholders are offered, required or permitted to participate and which has been approved by SSTs board of directors or strategic committee of the board of directors, or (iv) subject to certain volume limitations.

In addition, SST will set a new record date for its special meeting of shareholders scheduled for April 8, 2010 to consider the Merger and Merger Agreement.
The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Second Amendment, are subject to customary closing conditions including approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SST.

CHANDLER, Arizona  March 8, 2010  (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductors, today announced that it entered into a second amendment to its February 2, 2010 definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI).  Under the revised terms, SST shareholders would be entitled to receive $3.05 per share in cash compared to $3.00 per share prior to the second amendment.  This second amendment was in response to an offer made by another party to SSTs Strategic Committee on March 2, 2010.
 
Additionally, in connection with the amendment, Microchip is today purchasing directly from SST newly issued shares in an amount equal to 19.9% of the current issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of SST at $3.05 per share in cash.  In the event that Microchips acquisition of SST is not consummated, Microchip has agreed that as a general matter, it will not use its voting rights to block a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal and the profits on its sales in such transaction will be limited.  Furthermore, Microchip will have an option to sell its shares back to SST at $3.05 per share.
The $3.05 per share represents an approximate 45.2% premium to the amount that the holders of SST common stock would have received under the merger agreement between SST and Technology Resources Holdings, Inc., and an approximate 64.0% premium to the closing price per share of SSTs stock on November 12, 2009, the last day of trading prior to the announcement of the execution of the definitive merger agreement with Technology Resources Holdings, Inc.
The amendment wasapproved by the Boards of Directors of each company and the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2010, subject to approval by SSTs stockholders and other customary closing conditions.  SST has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for April 8, 2010 to consider the transaction.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.2 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010.
The March quarter was another exceptional growth quarter for Microchip across all geographies and product lines, which resulted in us achieving 11.2% sequential revenue growth and exceeding our gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively on March 15, 2010, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
Non-GAAP gross margins were a record 61.63%, up over 260 basis points from the December quarter.  Our achievement of this level of gross margin percentage is a full year ahead of our previous expectation.  Microchips factories are running at higher levels of production output than they have ever produced in the history of the company, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results with revenue up a strong 10.3% on a sequential basis and up 58.2% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue and was up 22.9% sequentially and up 133.3% from the year ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress with 36% sequential growth from a small but rapidly growing base, and building upon the 44% sequential growth it experienced in the December quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 19.3% sequential growth, and was up 91.6% from the year ago quarter.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Due to the exceptional revenue growth we experienced in the March quarter, inventory days on Microchips balance sheet decreased from 99 at the end of the December quarter to 97 at March 31, 2010.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 and with the incremental activities we have deployed to meet customer demand we expect to build a few days of inventory in

the June quarter.  Days of inventory in the distribution channel were relatively flat in the March 2010 quarter compared to December 31, 2009.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased only 1.4% sequentially in the March quarter and was actually down 4.4% from the levels of our prior peak earnings quarter of September 2008.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the March quarter, our cash and investments position increased by $31.9 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $63.0 million.  We expect our cash generation to continue to be strong in fiscal 2011.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited to have closed the acquisition of Silicon Storage Technology Inc. (SST) on April 8, 2010.  We are working diligently on the integration activities associated with SST which include taking actions to achieve strong financial returns from the continuing businesses, integrating the SST employees into the Microchip culture and actively marketing those assets held for sale.  We believe the SST transaction will provide substantial long-term value to our stockholders.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We continue to be very pleased with how our business has performed over the past four quarters, during which time we believe we have gained market share in all of our strategic product lines.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was 1.36, providing us with excellent visibility.  We started the June 2010 quarter with a record high opening backlog due to the strength of our business combined with lead times extending in the semiconductor industry in general.  In the June 2010 quarter, we expect revenue from Microchips business excluding SST to be up about 8% sequentially and we expect the continuing operations of SST to add about $18 million in revenue to our overall results.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities, patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acqui sitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $320.8 million, up 15.4% sequentially from net sales of $278.0 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 66.3% from net sales of $192.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $89.6 million, or 47 cents per diluted share, up 18.3% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 227.4% from GAAP net income of $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter.
Consolidated Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $104.2 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, up 20.2% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $86.7 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 197.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $35.0 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  For the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), the acquisition of patent licenses and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.3 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on August 19, 2010.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
"The June quarter was another exceptional quarter for Microchip.  Microchips net sales, excluding SST, grew 8.8% sequentially, we achieved the high end of our gross margin guidance, and exceeded our operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we provided on May 5, 2010," said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  "Microchips non-GAAP gross margins excluding SST were a record 62% for the quarter ending June 2010.  Microchip's factories are running at higher levels of production output than they have ever produced in the history of the company, maintaining the high efficiency, quality and yields for which we are known.  Excluding SST, Microchip's business produced record non-GAAP operating margins of 37.0% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of 51 cents per dil uted share."

The continuing operations of SST produced $18.4 million in net sales, 90% non-GAAP gross margins, 52.5% non-GAAP operating profit, and 4 cents of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share," continued Mr. Sanghi.  "With the sale of several non-core assets and substantial operating expense reductions, we are pleased to achieve operating profitability for SST and announce the very first quarter under Microchips ownership to be accretive to our earnings.  These results exceeded our original guidance for the June quarter provided on May 5, 2010."
"The consolidated results from continuing operations produced net sales of $320.8 million in the June 2010 quarter, non-GAAP gross margins of 63.6%, non-GAAP operating profit of 37.9% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 55 cents.  We are exceptionally pleased with these record-setting results," Mr. Sanghi added.
"Our microcontroller business delivered superb results with net sales up a strong 9.8% on a sequential basis and up 55.3% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly net sales and was up 26% sequentially and up 154% from the year ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress with 86% sequential growth from a small but rapidly growing base, and building upon the 36% sequential growth it experienced in the June quarter," said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  "Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 17.8% sequential growth, and was up 101.2% from the year ago quarter."
Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "Microchip's inventory days on its balance sheet decreased from 97 days at the end of March to 96 days at the end of June.  Distribution inventory dropped one day, to 40 days at the end of the June quarter.  Overall inventory combining Microchip and distributor balances was down two days on June 30, 2010 compared to the balances at March 31, 2010.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 and we continue to ramp our factories to increase capacity to meet our customers' demand."
Mr. Bjornholt continued, "We ended the June quarter with a total cash and investment position of approximately $1.5 billion.  We expect our cash generation to be very strong in the September quarter and for the remainder of fiscal 2011."
Mr. Sanghi added, "We continue to make outstanding progress in the integration and restructuring of the SST business including the sale of certain assets.  We announced the consummation of the sale of the NAND drive and certain memory product lines on May 21, 2010.  On July 8, 2010, we announced an exclusive limited license to

Professional Computer Technology, Ltd. that allows them to manufacture certain Serial NOR-Flash products and sell these products to a specific licensed market under its own brand name.  We are progressing well on the sale of the WiFi power amplifier business and continue our rationalization efforts for the various SST memory product lines.  We continue diligent work on the integration activities associated with SST, including taking actions to achieve strong financial returns from the continuing businesses, integrating the SST employees into the Microchip culture and actively marketing those assets that are being held for sale.  We are confident that the SST transaction will provide substantial long-term value to our stockholders."
Mr. Sanghi said, "We are very pleased with how our business has performed in recent quarters and are confident that we have gained market share in our microcontroller and analog markets.  Microchip's book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter excluding SST was approximately 1.41, providing us with a record high opening backlog.  In the September 2010 quarter, we expect net sales from Microchip's business including SST to be up approximately 6% to 7% sequentially.  We expect the continuing operations of SST to deliver approximately $20 million in net sales to our overall results."
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "As we look into the December quarter, our backlog is substantially higher than it was for the September quarter at the same point in time.  We continue to see robust demand around the world, driven by exceptionally strong new design wins in our microcontroller and analog product lines.  We are increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet the projected demands of our customers in the December quarter.  Considering all of this, we expect the December quarter net sales to be up approximately 3% over the September quarter, in our otherwise seasonally weakest quarter of the year."
Acquisition of Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.
On April 8, 2010, Microchip acquired SST, a public company based in Sunnyvale, California, in a merger transaction for $3.05 per share, or a total of $353.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to SST's net assets based upon their estimated fair values as of April 8, 2010. The excess purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. The continuing operations of SST include the licensing and microcontroller divisions.  The discontinued operations include SST's various memory product lines and WiFi power amplifier businesses.  The purchase price allocation resulted in net tangible assets acquired of $231.5 million for continuing operations, and $5 4.5 million for discontinued operations and intangible assets of

.  Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Agreement will be paid to the Grantee (or in the event of the Grantee's death, to his or her estate) in Shares (unless otherwise determined by the Administrator and stated in the Appendix), upon satisfaction, as determined by the Company, of any Tax-Related Items as set forth in paragraph 9 of this Agreement.  The Shares will be issued to the Grantee as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2 ) months from the end of (i) the Grantees tax year that in cludes the applicable Vesting Date, or (ii) the Companys tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.

Grant is Not Transferable
 
8.
 
.  Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming under or through the Grantee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until the Grantees rights with respect to the RSUs have become vested and certificates representing such Shares have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Grantee or Grantees broker or the Shares have been electronically transferred to Grantees account.
Rights as Stockholder
 
9.
 
.  Regardless of any action the Company or the Grantees employer (the Employer) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantees participation in the Plan that are legally applicable to the Grantee (Tax-Related Items), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains his or her responsibility and that such liability may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Emplo yer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant or vesting of the RSUs, the issuance of Shares on the relevant Vesting Date, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at vesting of the RSUs, if any, and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Grantees liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee becomes subject to tax and/or social security contributions in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable, tax and/or social security contribution withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Tax Obligations
 
Prior to any relevant taxable, tax and/or social security contribution withholding event, the Grantee shall pay or make appropriate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, at their sole discretion, to satisfy the obligations with respect to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Grantees wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and/or the Employer; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting of the RSUs, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arrangement by the Company (on the Grantees behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in Shares to b e issued upon vesting of the RSUs; or (iv) by requiring direct payment from the Grantee in cash (or its equivalent). To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company will withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates.  If the Grantees and/or the Companys withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items are satisfied as described in (iii) of this paragraph, the Company will endeavor to sell only the number of Shares required to satisfy the Grantees and/or the Companys withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items; however, the Grantee agrees that the Company may sell more Shares than necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items.  Further, the Grantee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for purposes of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspe ct of the Grantees participation in the Plan.  The Grantee hereby consents to any action reasonably taken by the Company to satisfy his or her obligations for Tax-Related Items.
 
 
 
 
2
 
 
Finally, the Grantee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantees participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares at vesting if the Grantee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
10.
 
.  In accepting the RSUs, the Grantee expressly acknowledges, understands and agrees to the following:
Nature of Grant
 
(a)
 
The Company is granting the Award under the Plan.  The Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature, and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time;
 
(b)
 
The grant of the Award, future grants of Awards, if any, and benefits and rights provided under the Plan are voluntary, occasional and at the complete discretion of the Company and do not constitute regular or periodic payments.  No grant of Awards will be deemed to create any contractual or other right to receive future RSU Awards or benefits in lieu of RSUs, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant or whether such Awards have been granted repeatedly in the past.  All decisions with respect to future RSU Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
 
(c)
 
For Grantees residing outside the U.S., the RSUs and the Shares subject to the RSUs are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and which are outside the scope of the Grantees employment contract, if any;
 
(d)
 
For Grantees residing outside the U.S., the RSUs and the Shares subject to the RSUs are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
 
(e)
 
For Grantees residing outside the U.S., the RSUs and the Shares subject to the RSUs are not part of Grantees normal or expected salary or compensation for any purposes, including, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, vacation, bonuses, long-term service awards, indemnification, pension or retirement or welfare benefits, or any other payments, benefits or rights of any kind, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Subsidiary;
 
 
 
3
 
 
(f)
 
The RSUs and the Grantees participation in the Plan shall not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary;
 
(g)
 
The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
 
(h)
 
No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU Awards resulting from termination of the Grantees employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and regardless of whether in breach of local labor laws) and, in consideration of the RSU Awards, to which the Grantee otherwise is not entitled, the Grantee irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Gran tee shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
 
(i)
 
In the event the Grantees termination of employment (regardless of whether in breach of local labor laws), the Grantees right to vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Grantee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (., active employment would not include a period of garden leave or similar period pursuant to local law); the Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Grantee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the RSUs;
e.g
 
(j)
 
The Company has the right, at any time to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan.  The Plan will not be deemed to constitute, and will not be construed by Grantee to constitute, part of the terms and conditions of employment, and that the Company will not incur any liability of any kind to Grantee as a result of any change or amendment, or any cancellation, of the Plan at any time.
 
(k)
 
The Grantee's employment with the Employer is not affected at all by any Award and shall not create a right to further employment with the Employer.  Accordingly, the terms of the Grantee's employment with the Employer will be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Grantee (as the case may be), and the Grantees participation in the Plan shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Grantee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause or notice, except as may be expressly prohibited by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Grantee is employed; and
 
(l)
 
The Grantee is voluntarily participating in the Plan.
 
11.
 
. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Grantees participation in the Plan, or the Grantees acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares.  The Grantee is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Moreover, if the proceeds from the sale of the Shares are converted to local curr ency, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company (including its Parent and Subsidiary corporations) is under no obligation to secure any particular currency conversion rate and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due to exchange control restrictions in the PRC.  The Grantee agrees to bear the risk of any fluctuation in the U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate between the date the Grantee realizes U.S. dollar proceeds from his or her participation in the Plan and the date that the Grantee receives cash proceeds converted to local currency.

Such recipients may receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer Data in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering, and managing the Grantees participation in the Plan.  The Grantee understands that these recipients may be located in or outside the European Economic Area, such as in the United States or elsewhere.

The processing activity, including communication, the transfer of Data abroad, including outside of the European Economic Area, as herein specified and pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, does not require the Grantees consent thereto, as the processing is necessary to performance of contractual obligations related to implementation, administration, and management of the Plan.  The Grantee understands that, pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, the Grantee has the right to, without limitation, access, delete, update, correct, or terminate, for legitimate reason, the Data processing.

No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation.  
 
By accepting the RSUs, the Grantee understands and agrees that any modification of the Plan or the Agreement or its termination shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of employment.
Modification.  
 
The Award of RSUs the Company is making under the Plan is unilateral and discretionary and, therefore, the Company reserves the absolute right to amend it and discontinue it at any time without any liability.
Policy Statement.  
 
The Company, with registered offices at 2355 West Chandler Boulevard, Chandler, AZ 85224, U.S.A., is solely responsible for the administration of the Plan and participation in the Plan and the acquisition of Shares does not, in any way, establish an employment relationship between the Grantee and the Company since the Grantee is participating in the Plan on a wholly commercial basis and the sole employer is Microchip Technology Mexico, S.DE R.L. DE C. V. nor does it establish any rights between the Grantee and the Employer.
 
  By accepting the RSUs, the Grantee acknowledges that he/she has received copies of the Plan, has reviewed the Plan and the Agreement in their entirety and fully understands and accepts all provisions of the Plan and the Agreement.
Plan Document Acknowledgment.

Finally, the Grantee hereby declares that he/she does not reserve any action or right to bring any claim against the Company for any compensation or damages as a result of the Grantees participation in the Plan and therefore grant a full and broad release to the Employer, the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary with respect to any claim that may arise under the Plan.

  The RSUs are being granted pursuant to the Qualifying Person exemption under section 273(1)(f) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.) (SFA).  The Plan has not been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  The Grantee should note that the RSUs are subject to section 257 of the SFA, and the Grantee will not be able to make (i) any subsequent sale of the Shares in Singapore or (ii) any offer of such subsequent sale of the Shares subject to the RSUs in Singapore, unless such sale or offer is made pursuant to the exemptions under Part XIII Division (1) Subdivision (4) (other than section 280) of the SFA (Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.).

SPAIN
 
  The RSUs provide a conditional right to Shares and may be forfeited or affected by the Grantees termination of employment, as set forth in the Agreement.  For avoidance of doubt, the Grantees rights, if any, to the RSUs upon termination of employment shall be determined as set forth in the Agreement, including, without limitation, where (i) the Grantee is deemed to be constructively dismissed or unfairly dismissed without good cause; (ii) the Grantee is dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (iii) the Grantee terminates employment due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition (except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Agreement); or (iv) the Grantee terminates employment due to the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries unilateral breach of contract.  Consequently, the termination of the Grantees employment for any of the above reasons shall be governed by paragraphs 4 and 19(i) of the Agreement, unless otherwise determined by the Company, in its sole discretion.
Termination of Employment.
 
  By accepting the RSUs, the Grantee acknowledges that he or she understands and agrees to the terms and conditions applicable to participation in the Plan and that he or she has received a copy of the Plan.
Labor Law Acknowledgment.
 
The Grantee understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the Plan and the Agreement.  Consequently, the Grantee understands that any grant is given on the assumption and condition that it shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance c ompensation) or any other right whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Grantee understands and freely accepts that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever shall arise from any gratuitous and discretionary grant since the future value of the RSUs and the underlying Shares is unknown and unpredictable.  In addition, the Grantee understands that this grant would not be made but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, the Grantee understands, acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void.
 
  The RSUs and the Shares issued upon vesting are considered a private placement outside of the scope of Spanish laws on public offerings and issuances of securities.

  The following provision supplements paragraph 9 (Tax Obligations) of the Agreement:
Tax Obligations.
 
If payment or withholding of the Tax-Related Items is not made within ninety (90) days of the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Items or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the Due Date), the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items shall constitute a loan owed by the Grantee to the Employer, effective as of the Due Date.  The Grantee agrees that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majestys Revenue & Customs (HMRC), it will be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in paragraph 9 of the Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the Grantee shall not be eligible for a loan from the Company to cover the Tax-Related Items.  In the event that the Grantee is a director or executive officer and any such Tax-Related Items are not collected from or paid by the Grantee by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items will constitute a benefit to the Grantee on which additional income tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs) will be payable.  The Grantee understands that he or she will be responsible for reporting any income tax and NICs (including the Employer NICs, as defined below) due on this additional benefit direct ly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime.
 
  Notwithstanding any discretion in the Plan, the RSUs will be settled in Shares only.  The RSUs do not provide any right for the Grantee to receive a cash payment.
RSUs Payable in Shares Only.
 
 
 
18
 
 
  As a condition of vesting of the RSUs, the Grantee agrees to accept any liability for secondary Class 1 national insurance contributions, which may be payable by the Company or the Employer in connection with the RSUs (Employer NICs).  To accomplish the foregoing, the Grantee agrees to enter into an election between himself or herself and the Employer (the Election), by printing, signing and returning the form approved for such Election by HMRC and attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement to the Human Resources Manager prior to vesting of the RSUs. The Grantee further agrees to enter into any other consents or elections required to accom plish the transfer of the Employer NICs to the Grantee, prior to vesting of the RSUs.  The Grantee further agrees to enter into such other joint elections as may be required between himself or herself and any successor to the Company and/or the Employer.  If the Grantee does not enter into an Election prior to the vesting of the RSUs, the Grantee will permanently forfeit the RSUs without any liability to the Company and/or the Employer and any Shares that have been issued upon vesting will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company.
Joint Election for Transfer of Secondary Class 1 National Insurance Contributions to the Grantee.
 
The Grantee further agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may collect the Employer NICs by any of the means set forth in paragraph 9 of the Agreement, as supplemented above.

CHANDLER, Arizona  November 4, 2010  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2010 as summarized in the following table:

Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology Inc. (SST) on April 8, 2010.  At the time of the acquisition the Company determined that it would hold SSTs SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses as assets held for sale, in addition to other businesses that Microchip has sold since the acquisition date, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  After operating the SST business for two quarters, we have found synergies between SSTs RF business and Microchips wireless, microcontroller and analog businesses.  On the memory side, after divesting the low margin business to PCT in Taiwan in a transaction that was announced in July 2010, we have substantially improved the gross margin for the rest of the SuperFlash Memory business. Additionally, we have found that running some volume on the memory business is criti cal to proving out the technology before it can be licensed.  There are also significant operational synergies with Microchips memory business and technology synergies with Microchips microcontroller business.  Therefore, we have decided to integrate the SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses of SST into the ongoing businesses of Microchip, Mr. Sanghi continued.  These businesses added $40.0 million of net sales in the three months ending September 30, 2010, and $76.3 million of net sales in the six months ended September 30, 2010.

Reports Second Quarter
Fiscal 2011 Results
Page 3
 
As required by GAAP, in this press release and in future filings with the SEC, the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will be presented as if the SST SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses were always included in the continuing operations of Microchip.  Microchips second quarter fiscal 2011 guidance for continuing operations provided on August 5, 2010 did not include the SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses and without these businesses Microchip guided its net sales to be $340 to $343 million for the September quarter.  The actual results for these businesses achieved $342.3 million which is near the high end of the previous guidance.  The remainder of the information included in this press release is presented on a full consolidated basis including all continuing operations of Microchip on this revised basis.
Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were $382.3 million, up 7.0% sequentially from net sales of $357.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 68.7% from net sales of $226.7 million in the prior years second quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, up 14.0% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $91.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 135.5% from GAAP net income of $44.5 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second quarter.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, up 8.8% from consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $109.9 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 124.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second quarter.  For the second fiscal quarters of each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with a cquisitions), the acquisition of patent licenses and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.4 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on December 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2010.  In light of the expected tax law changes coming in January 2011, the highest federal tax

rate on dividends is likely to go from 15% currently to 39.6% on January 1, 2011.  While we do not know what the current congress or the newly elected congress and President Obama may decide on the expiration of President Bushs tax cuts, we believe that our investors deserve to pay the lowest tax rate on dividends paid by Microchip.  Therefore, Microchip will accelerate its dividend payment from March 2011 into late December 2010.  The Board of Directors has declared this cash dividend on its common stock of 34.5 cents per share.  This dividend is payable on December 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 13, 2010.  After this payment, Microchips next dividend payment will be in June of 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Mr. Sanghi said, The September quarter was an all-time record for Microchip in many respects.  Microchips net sales for the September quarter were a record $382.3 million and were up 7% sequentially.  Non-GAAP operating income was an all-time record high of $138.2 million, at 36.2% of sales.  Our August 5, 2010 guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share was 58 cents and our non-GAAP EPS for the September quarter was a record 63 cents.  We are proud to present these record breaking results to our stakeholders.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited that we have completed the integration and restructuring of SST and have transformed SST into a very profitable entity that was accretive to Microchips non-GAAP earnings per share by about 8 cents for the September quarter.  We expect SST to add approximately 32 cents to Microchips non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2011 and about 40 cents for fiscal year 2012.
Our microcontroller business delivered another all-time record in net sales for Microchip of $256.7 million and was up 4.7% sequentially.  Net sales of our 16-bit microcontrollers were up 22% sequentially and more than doubled from the year ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Net sales of our 32-bit microcontrollers were down 10.9% sequentially, and up 225% year over year.   In the first six months of this fiscal year, 32-bit microcontroller sales are up 320% over the same period last year from a small but rapidly growing base.  We expect to see significant growth in this product line over the next several years.  Our analog products produced the sixth consecutive double-digit sales growth quarter, achieving 11.6% sequential growth, and was up 99.8% from the year ago quarter.

Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory days on its balance sheet decreased from 98 days at the end of June to 97 days at the end of September.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 days, leaving us well-positioned to use the current business environment to replenish our inventory levels, which should allow us to shorten lead times and appropriately support our customers.  Distribution inventory in the September quarter increased to 34 days from 33 days at the end of the June quarter.  Overall inventory combining Microchip and distributor balances were flat at September 30, 2010 compared to the balances at June 30, 2010 at 131 days.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, The September quarter was an all-time record for Microchip in net cash generation.  We achieved $156.9 million in net cash generation prior to the payment of our $63.9 million dividend in the September quarter.  We ended the September 2010 quarter with $1.57 billion in cash and investments and we expect strong cash generation for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
Mr. Sanghi added, Microchips net sales have grown from $226.7 million in the September 2009 quarter to $382.3 million in the September quarter 2010, a growth of 68.7%.  Annualizing our September quarter results, we are now over a $1.5 billion sales run rate and we believe we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of $2 billion in net sales in the coming years.  We are confident that Microchip has continued to gain market share in the microcontroller and analog markets.  We did experience a slowdown in bookings activity in the September quarter, as customers and distributors adjust their backlog and inventory.  This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.87 and therefore we are cautious regarding the revenue outlook for the December quarter.  We expect net sales to be down approximately 2% to 8% sequentially in the December quarter, which is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acqui sitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $367.8 million, down 3.8% sequentially from net sales of $382.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 47.1% from net sales of $250.1 million in the prior years third quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $101.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, down 2.7% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 46.9% from GAAP net income of $69.4 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third quarter.  Due to the appreciation in the price of our common stock in the December 2010 quarter, the dilutive share count reflects the effect of our convertible debentures, with the effect of an additional 4.4 million shares sequentially, which negatively impacted our GAAP diluted earnings per share by about 1.2 cents.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $113.8 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, down 4.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 62.2% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $70.1 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third quarter.  Due to the appreciation in the price of our common stock in the December 2010 quarter, the dilutive share count reflects the effect of our convertible debentures, with the effect of an additional 4.4 million shares sequentially, which negatively impacted our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by about 1.3 cents.  For the third fiscal quarter of both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), the tax benefit from tax audit settlements and tax law changes and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip announced on November 4, 2010 that its Board of Directors accelerated the March 2011 quarterly cash dividend payment on its common stock of 34.5 cents per share into the December 31, 2010 quarter.  Microchips next dividend payment will be in June of 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchips performance in the December 2010 quarter exceeded our expectations.  Net sales, gross margins, operating income and earnings per share were better than the mid-point of our guidance provided on November 30, 2010, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  The gross margin upside was driven by ongoing cost reductions in our manufacturing processes, a favorable product mix and continued improvements in the product lines we acquired from SST.  Operating expenses continue to be well managed and came in at the mid-point of our guidance at 24.1% of sales on a non-GAAP basis in the December quarter.

Mr. Sanghi added, The SST acquisition has done exceptionally well for Microchip.  The technology licensing business produced an all-time record high in revenue of $19.1 million, up 10.3% sequentially.  Additionally, in the December quarter we continued to make outstanding progress in improving the operating models for the SuperFlash Memory division and the RF division through our hard work in partnering with customers, targeting markets, focusing on pricing, improving manufacturing costs and incorporating these divisions into Microchips business structure.  We believe there are significant improvements ahead of us for the gross margins of these divisions and we are well on our way to achieving 32 cents of non-GAAP earnings per share from the SST acquisition in fiscal 2011 and 40 cents in fiscal 2012.
Our microcontroller business performed better than we expected in the December quarter with net sales only down 2.2% on a sequential basis and up 24% from the year ago quarter.  We shipped our 9 billionth cumulative microcontroller in December and finished calendar 2010 shipping a record 1.3 billion microcontrollers.  For calendar 2010 our microcontroller revenue was up 42.4% from the calendar 2009 levels, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our 32-bit microcontroller line, which took a pause in the September quarter, had a strong quarter of revenue growth and was up 45% sequentially, achieving a new record.  For calendar 2010, net sales for our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 113.6% and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 260%.  We believe we gained significant market share in all three microcontroller segments in calendar 2010.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory position improved significantly in the December quarter.  Inventory on Microchips balance sheet increased to $177.7 million, representing 107 days of inventory and a sequential increase of 10 days.  We continue to make progress in moving towards our internal target of 115 days of inventory which will allow us to improve our lead times to levels in line with our historical performance and appropriately support our customers.  Inventory days in the distribution channel grew by three days.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, Microchips net cash generation in the December quarter was $133.5 million prior to making the two dividend payments, which totaled $129.4 million.  We ended the December 2010 quarter with $1.57 billion of cash and investments and we expect our cash generation in the March 2011 quarter to continue to be strong.

Mr. Sanghi added, Looking back at calendar year 2010, Microchip had one of its best growth years ever with over 64% revenue growth, compared to calendar year 2009.  As we enter calendar 2011, we believe we are exceptionally well-positioned for continued growth in all of our product lines.  The March quarter will be seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia.  Taking all of these factors into consideration we expect net sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially.

Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $380.0 million, up 3.3% sequentially from net sales of $367.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 36.7% from net sales of $278.0 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $130.6 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, up 28.1% from GAAP net income of $101.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 72.4% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter.  GAAP net income includes a one-time favorable tax benefit of $24.4 million which includes the settlement of an IRS audit for tax years through March 31, 2008, and other one-time tax events.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $119.0 million, or 59 cents per diluted share, up 4.6% from non-GAAP net income of $113.8 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 37.3% from non-GAAP net income of $86.7 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter.

acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were a record $1.487 billion, an increase of 56.9% from net sales of $947.7 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was a record $429.2 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, an increase of 97.8% from net income of $217.0 million, or $1.16 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was a record $462.3 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, an increase of 88.7% from net income of $245.0 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.6 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 2, 2011 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchips performance in the March 2011 quarter and in fiscal year 2011 was outstanding.  We exceeded the high end of our gross margin and earnings per share guidance, even with the challenging backdrop of the world economy and the Japan crisis, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  The March quarter marked our 82 consecutive quarter of profitability and is a testimony to the resiliency of our business model.
nd
Mr. Sanghi added, Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Microchip in sales, profitability and earnings per share.  Our 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog product lines all achieved new full year revenue records and our licensing business achieved a record quarterly revenue in the March 2011 quarter.
In the March 2011 quarter our microcontroller business performed at the high end of our expectations, with revenue up 4% on a sequential basis, and up 17% from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 24% sequentially and was up 86% from the year-ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 35% sequentially and was up 226% from the year-ago quarter.  Our analog business was up 3.5% sequentially, and was up 45% from the year-ago quarter.

Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory on Microchips balance sheet at March 31, 2011 was $180.8 million, representing 107 days of inventory, which was flat in days to the prior quarter level.  Our internal target for inventory days is 115, and we plan to continue to build inventory towards that target to maintain short lead times and support our customers delivery requirements.  Inventory days at our distributors increased to 40 days, compared to 39 days at the end of the prior quarter.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, Microchips net cash and investment balance grew by $135.3 million in the March quarter.  We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.71 billion of cash and investments and we expect continued strong cash generation in the June 2011 quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We continue to evaluate the effects that the tragedy in Japan may have on our business.  We have a strong backlog position for the June quarter, but there is still some uncertainty regarding the impact from the Japan crisis on the world economy.  Taking these factors into consideration, we expect net sales in the June 2011 quarter to be up sequentially between 1% and 6%.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

The estimated negative impact on our earnings per diluted share calculation resulting from the difference in our assumed average stock price for the June 2011 quarter as compared to the March 2011 quarter is about one cent, when combining the additional dilutive effect from our convertible debt, and the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards.

CHANDLER, Arizona  July 11, 2011  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, analog and Flash-IP solutions, announced today that it expects its net sales for its first quarter of fiscal 2012 ending June 30, 2011 to be down about 1.5% sequentially.  On May 5, 2011, Microchip provided guidance of net sales increasing 1% to 6% sequentially.  Microchip also announced today that first quarter fiscal 2012 GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately 47 to 49 cents and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately 53 to 55 cents.  On May 5, 2011, Microchip provided guidance of GAAP EPS of 52 to 55 cents and non-GAAP EPS of 58 to 62 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Our net sales activity in the June quarter did not progress as we originally expected, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  We are seeing broad based weakness in our business due to a number of factors.  In the June quarter, our automotive business was down significantly from the March 2011 quarter due to lower automotive production activities including supply issues from other manufacturers associated with the earthquake in Japan.  We also believe that some of the revenue upside that we saw in the March 2011 quarter was the result of customers being cautious and accelerating purchasing activities to minimize supply chain disruptions.  Therefore, we believe we were also impacted by the correction of that inventory in the June 2011 quarter.  Additionally, our consumer business was soft due to poorer global economic conditions including high unemployment, high oil prices and the resulting low consumer confidence.  The computing portion of our business was also lower than our expectations as we saw reduced purchases by multiple large customers in this sector.
While we are obviously disappointed with our June quarter results, we continue to see excellent design win traction in our microcontroller and analog product lines and maintain a strong competitive position.  Our 32-bit microcontroller net sales were up 18.7% sequentially and up 108% over the year ago quarter, reaching a new record.  We believe that our overall June quarter results reflect weak global market conditions which we believe will impact the broad-based semiconductor industry in the June or September quarter depending on the individual market exposures and revenue recognition practices of the companies, added Mr. Sanghi.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are cautiously modeling our September quarter revenue to be sequentially down by low to mid single digits.  We will provide updated revenue and full financial guidance for the September quarter during our August 4, 2011 financial results conference call.  At the end of the June and September quarters, our inventory is expected to be in the 120 to 130 day range, which is acceptable to us and will enable us to keep our lead times short and help us be more competitive in our markets.  We are taking actions to control our expenses through our variable compensation and other discretionary programs, but do not plan to lay off any employees.  Our gross margin in the June quarter is expected to be about 58.4% to 58.8% on GAAP basis and 59.3% to 59.7% on non-GAAP basis and remain in that range in the September quarter.  Our long term target for non-GAAP gross margin remains in the 61% to 62% range.  Our operating expenses for the June and September quarters are expected to remain in the range of 24% to 26% of net sales, in line with our long-term model that we have communicated to investors.
Microchip will host a conference call today, July 11, 2011, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss this release.  This call will be simulcast over the Internet at .

The quarterly dividend is payable on September 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on August 18, 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
We saw broad-based softness in our business due to weak global economic conditions, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  This manifested itself into demand and bookings weakness across multiple market segments and multiple customers in each segment.
Mr. Sanghi added, As we expected, this weakness has now been reflected in the guidance of multiple companies in the semiconductor industry.
While our microcontroller business was down 2% sequentially, our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth with revenue up 18.7% sequentially, and up 108% from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Design win momentum in all of our product lines continues to be strong and we expect these wins to contribute to revenue growth as the economic headwinds we are experiencing subside.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, In the June quarter, inventory on our balance sheet grew to 119 days.  Inventory levels at our distributors grew by 3 days sequentially to end the June quarter at 43
days.  We are comfortable with these inventory levels given the long life cycle for our products, and we continue to view our short lead times as a competitive advantage.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, While we are obviously disappointed with our June quarter results, we believe we are well-positioned to grow market share over the long term in our microcontroller, analog and licensing product lines.  However, in the September 2011 quarter we expect to continue to experience the lingering effects of weak global economic conditions.  Therefore, we expect net sales in the September 2011 quarter to be down sequentially in percentage terms by low to mid single digits.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions.  Tax events related to IRS settlements, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other one-time tax events are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in

understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Item 1.01.
    
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 12, 2011, Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the 
Company
), entered into a Credit Agreement (the 
Credit Agreement
) among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million revolving credit facility, with a $100 million foreign currency sublimit, a $25 million letter of credit sublimit and a $15 million swingline loan sublimit, terminating on August 12, 2016 (the 
Maturity Date
). The Credit Agreement also contains an increase option permitting the Company, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with existing lenders and/or new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of $250 million in additional commitments, which commitments may be for revolving loans or term loans. Proceeds of loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. No loans were made nor letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement at closing.
The loans bear interest, at the Company's option, at the base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.50% or an adjusted LIBOR rate (based on one, two, three or six-month interest periods) plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.50%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter periods. The base rate means the highest of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% and the adjusted LIBOR rate for a 1-month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%. Swingline loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans. Base rate loans may only be made in Dollars. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary closing fees, arrangement fees, administration fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period (or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Company may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts in the case of commitment reductions and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of prepayments of LIBOR loans.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the Credit Agreement. To secure the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries will be required to pledge the equity securities of certain of their respective material subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into restrictive agreements and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. The Company is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that, include among other things, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, ERISA defaults and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts.
2
Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or the Company's affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Loans and Borrowings
. (a) Each Revolving Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided

Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan (and in the case of an Affiliate, the provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 shall apply to such Affiliate to the same extent as to such Lender);
provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or, if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, 1,000,000 units of such currency) and not less than $5,000,000 (or, if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency 5,000,000 units of such currency). At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000;
provided
that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the aggregate Dollar Tranche Commitments or the aggregate Multicurrency Tranche Commitments, as applicable, or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.06(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time;
provided
that there shall not at any time be more than a total of five (5) Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings outstanding.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
SECTION 2.03.
Requests for Revolving Borrowings
. To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request (a) by irrevocable written notice (via a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower, promptly followed by telephonic confirmation of such request) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three (3) Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or by irrevocable written notice (via a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower) not later than four (4) Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency), in each case before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) by telephone in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, one (1) Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing;

If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
SECTION 2.04.
Determination of Dollar Amounts
. The Administrative Agent will, in a manner consistent with its customary practices, determine the Dollar Amount of:
(a)
each Multicurrency Tranche Eurocurrency Borrowing as of the date two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such Borrowing or, if applicable, the date of conversion/continuation of any Borrowing as a Multicurrency Tranche Eurocurrency Borrowing;
(b)
the LC Exposure as of the date of each request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit; and
(c)
all outstanding Credit Events on and as of the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and, during the continuation of an Event of Default, on any other Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders.
Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) is herein described as a Computation Date with respect to each Credit Event for which a Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day.
SECTION 2.05.
Swingline Loans
. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $15,000,000 or (ii) the Dollar Amount of the total Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the aggregate Multicurrency Tranche Commitments;
provided
that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available
24
to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Multicurrency Tranche Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Multicurrency Tranche Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Multicurrency Tranche Lender, specifying in such notice such Multicurrency Tranche Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Multicurrency Tranche Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Multicurrency Tranche Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Multicurrency Tranche Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Multicurrency Tranche Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Multicurrency Tranche Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Multicurrency Tranche Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Multicurrency Tranche Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Multicurrency Tranche Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
SECTION 2.06.
Letters of Credit
. (a)
General
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Multicurrency Tranche Letters of Credit denominated in Agreed Currencies and Dollar Tranche Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars, in each case for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the Agreed Currency applicable thereto, whether such Letter of Credit is a Multicurrency Tranche Letter of Credit or a Dollar Tranche Letter of Credit, the name and
25
address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) subject to Sections 2.04 and 2.11(b), the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000, (ii) subject to Sections 2.04 and 2.11(b), the sum of the Dollar Amount of the total Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Tranche Commitments, (iii) subject to Sections 2.04 and 2.11(b), the sum of the total Dollar Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Tranche Commitments and (iv) subject to Section 2.04 and 2.11(b), the Dollar Amount of the total outstanding Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Loans and Multicurrency Tranche LC Exposure, in each case denominated in Foreign Currencies, shall not exceed the Foreign Currency Sublimit.
(c)
Expiration Date
. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), including automatic one-year renewals so long as the expiration date otherwise complies with clause (ii) of this clause (c), and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
(d)
Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of the Tranche under which such Letter of Credit is issued (each such Lender, an 
Applicable Lender
), the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Applicable Lender, and each Applicable Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Applicable Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Applicable Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Applicable Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)
Reimbursement
. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if the Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Borrower, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by the Issuing Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than the Dollar Amount of $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Applicable Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Applicable Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section
26
2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Applicable Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Applicable Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Applicable Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by an Applicable Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Borrower's reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Multicurrency Tranche Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Multicurrency Tranche Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.
(f)
Obligations Absolute
. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures
. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
27
(h)
Interim Interest
. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, at the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate for such Agreed Currency
plus
the then effective Applicable Rate with respect to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans);
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Applicable Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Applicable Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i)
Replacement of Issuing Bank
. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j)
Cash Collateralization
. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (the 
LC Collateral Account
), an amount in cash equal to 105% of the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in a Foreign Currency that the Borrower is not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in the applicable Foreign Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Foreign Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the applicable Exchange Rate on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the Borrower. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
28
SECTION 2.07
Funding of Borrowings
. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders and (ii) in the case of each Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, by 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and at such Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to (x) an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City or Chicago and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars and (y) an account of the Borrower in the relevant jurisdiction and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency;
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.08
Interest Elections
. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election (by telephone or irrevocable written notice in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars or by irrevocable written notice (via an Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i) change the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.

(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing and whether such Borrowing is to be a Dollar Tranche Revolving Borrowing or Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Borrowing; and

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency in respect of which the Borrower shall have failed to deliver an Interest Election Request prior to the third (3

Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of any Class.

evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.14.
Alternate Rate of Interest

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority in Interest of the Lenders of any Class that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
33
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and any such Eurocurrency Borrowing shall, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, be repaid or converted into an ABR Borrowing, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (and if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective);

(
ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case
34
may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.17.
Taxes

Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
. Each payment by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding of Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
. The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

35
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(d) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Recipient delivers to the Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Loan Party (as applicable) in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

Exhibit G-2
on behalf of such partners; or
(F) any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
(iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(iii), FATCA shall include any amendments made to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code after the date of this Agreement.
(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.17(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never
37
been paid. This Section 2.17(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)
Issuing Bank
. For purposes of Section 2.17(e) and (f), the term Lender includes the Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.18.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to euro, in euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7
th
Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the 
Original Currency
) no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) At the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant to Section 9.03), and other sums payable under the Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03 or a deemed request as provided in this Section or may be deducted from any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to make a Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans) and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Sections 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05, as applicable and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents.
38
(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort,
39
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20.
Expansion Option
. The Borrower may from time to time elect to increase the total Dollar Tranche Commitments or the total Multicurrency Tranche Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an 
Incremental Term Loan
), in each case in minimum increments of $10,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $250,000,000. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an 
Increasing Lender
), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an 
Augmenting Lender
), to increase their existing Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or extend Commitments, as the case may be;
provided
that (i) each Augmenting Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit C
hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit D
hereto. No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.20. Increases and new Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower and (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance (on a Pro Forma Basis) with the covenants contained in Section 6.11 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments of any Class or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders of such Class, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class of all the Lenders to equal its Dollar Tranche Percentage or Multicurrency Tranche Percentage, as applicable, of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class as of the date of any increase in the Commitments of such Class (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans of such Class, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans, (b) shall not
40
mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans;
provided
that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans. Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an 
Incremental Term Loan Amendment
) of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20. Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time. No Lender shall be committed to increase its Commitment and/or to provide any portion of any Incremental Term Loans in respect of any exercise by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20 without the consent of such Lender.
SECTION 2.21.
Judgment Currency
. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the 
specified currency
) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, nonappealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.18, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.
SECTION 2.22.
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a);
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or a Majority in Interest of any Class of Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02);
provided
, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all or any part of the Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Dollar Tranche Lenders
41
in accordance with their respective Dollar Tranche Percentages but only to the extent the (A) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Dollar Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Dollar Tranche Lenders' Dollar Tranche Commitments and (B) each non-Defaulting Lender's Dollar Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Dollar Tranche Commitment; and all or any part of the Dollar Tranche LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Dollar Tranche Lenders in accordance with their respective Dollar Tranche Percentages but only to the extent (C) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Dollar Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Dollar Tranche LC Tranche Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Dollar Tranche Lenders' Dollar Tranche Commitments and (D) each non-Defaulting Lender's Dollar Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Dollar Tranche Commitment; and all or any part of the Multicurrency Tranche LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Multicurrency Tranche Lenders in accordance with their respective Multicurrency Tranche Percentages but only to the extent (E) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Multicurrency Tranche LC Tranche Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Multicurrency Tranche Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Commitments and (F) each non-Defaulting Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Commitment;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within two (2) Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) 
first
, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) 
second
, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.22(c), and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank,
42
as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Dollar Tranche Revolving Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) and/or Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

Schedule 3.01
to the Disclosure Letter identifies each Subsidiary as of the Effective Date, noting whether such Subsidiary is a Material Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, the percentage of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock or other equity interests owned by the Borrower and the other Subsidiaries and, if such percentage is not 100% (excluding directors' qualifying shares as required by law or shares held by nominees on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary as required by law), a description of each class issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Material Subsidiary are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares and other equity interests indicated on
Schedule 3.01
to the Disclosure Letter as owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary are owned, beneficially and of record, by the Borrower or any Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens created under the Pledge Agreements.

SECTION 3.03.
Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts

Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change
. (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity (in the case of clause (i) only) and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, certified by its chief financial officer.

SECTION 3.05.
Properties
. (a) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.
(b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and, to the Borrower's knowledge, the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.06.
Litigation, Environmental and Labor Matters
. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened in writing against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.
(b) Except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

All material payments due from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as liabilities on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement under which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is bound.
SECTION 3.07.
Compliance with Laws and Agreements
. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of Treasury) applicable to it or its property (including, without
44
limitation, the Act defined in Section 9.13) and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except, in each case, where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Administrative Agent

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or (vi) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Pledged Equity or the existence of the Pledged Equity.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties
61
of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject to the Borrower's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no such approval shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). If no successor shall have (i) been so appointed by the Required Lenders (and approved by the Borrower) and (ii) accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.
The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a representative of the Secured Parties within the meaning of the term secured party as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code. Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into each of the Pledge Agreements to which it is a party and to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each Lender agrees that no Secured Party (other than the Administrative Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Pledge Agreement, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the terms of the Pledge Agreements. In the event that any Pledged Equity is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Pledged Equity in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent upon any Pledged Equity (i) as described in Section 9.02(d); (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in

writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Pledged Equity pursuant hereto. Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Pledged Equity which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or pursuant hereto upon the Pledged Equity that was sold or transferred;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Administrative Agent's opinion, would expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Pledged Equity.
The Borrower, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, and each Lender, on its behalf and on the behalf of its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby irrevocably constitute the Administrative Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (
fond de pouvoir
within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Qubec) in order to hold hypothecs and security granted by the Borrower or any Subsidiary on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, and agree that the Administrative Agent may act as the bondholder and mandatary with respect to any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness that may be issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and pledged in favor of the Secured Parties in connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of the An Act respecting the special powers of legal persons (Qubec), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent may acquire and be the holder of any bond issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement (i.e., the
fond de pouvoir
may acquire and hold the first bond issued under any deed of hypothec by the Borrower or any Subsidiary).
The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate to create and perfect the rights of pledge for the benefit of the Secured Parties including a right of pledge with respect to the entitlements to profits, the balance left after winding up and the voting rights of the Borrower as ultimate parent of any subsidiary of the Borrower which is organized under the laws of the Netherlands and the Equity Interests of which are pledged in connection herewith (a 
Dutch Pledge
). Without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of parallel debt obligations of the Borrower or any relevant Subsidiary as will be described in any Dutch Pledge (the 
Parallel Debt
), including that any payment received by the Administrative Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt will conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Obligations, and any payment to the Secured Parties in satisfaction of the Obligations shall conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application be deemed as satisfaction of the corresponding amount of the Parallel Debt. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of a Dutch Pledge, any resignation by the Administrative Agent is not effective until its rights under the Parallel Debt are assigned to the successor Administrative Agent.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree for the purposes of taking and ensuring the continuing validity of German law governed pledges (
Pfandrechte
) with the creation of parallel debt obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as will be further described in a separate German law governed parallel debt undertaking. The Administrative Agent shall (i) hold such parallel debt undertaking as fiduciary agent (
Treuhnder
) and (ii) administer and hold as fiduciary agent (
Treuhnder
) any pledge created under a German law governed Pledge Agreement which is created in favor of any Secured Party or transferred to any Secured Party due to its accessory nature (
Akzessoriett
), in each case in its own name and for the account of the Secured Parties. Each Lender (on behalf of itself and its affiliated Secured Parties) hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter as its agent in its name and on its behalf into any German law governed Pledge Agreement, accept as its agent in its name and on its behalf any pledge or other
63
creation of any accessory security right in relation to this Agreement and to agree to and execute on its behalf as its representative in its name and on its behalf any amendments, supplements and other alterations to any such Pledge Agreement and to release on behalf of any such Lender or Secured Party any such Pledge Agreement and any pledge created under any such Pledge Agreement in accordance with the provisions herein and/or the provisions in any such Pledge Agreement.

SECTION 9.02.
Waivers; Amendments
. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or the percentage with respect to any Class of Lenders in the definition of the term Majority in Interest or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by Section 2.20 to be parties to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date), (vi) release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from their obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty other than in accordance with the Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Lender or (vii) except as provided in clause (d) of this Section or in any Pledge Agreement, release all or substantially all of the Pledged Equity without the written consent of each Lender;
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to each relevant Loan Document (x) to add one or more credit facilities (in addition to the Incremental Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Lenders.
(d) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties on any Pledged Equity (i) upon the termination of all the Commitments, payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment or termination), (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if the Borrower certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the
65
Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), or (iii) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of such Pledged Equity in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article VII. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Pledged Equity.
(e) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a 
Non-Consenting Lender
), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency.
SECTION 9.03.
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver
. (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel (and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication and distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an 
Indemnitee
) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any
66
actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (ii) a material breach in bad faith by such Indemnitee of its express contractual obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant to a claim made by the Borrower. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the Borrower's failure to pay any such amount shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof);
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor.
SECTION 9.04.
Successors and Assigns
. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
(A) the Borrower (provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof);
provided
,
further
, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee;
67
(B) the Administrative Agent; and
(C) the Issuing Bank.
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,
provided
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, such fee to be paid by either the assigning Lender or the assignee Lender or shared between such Lenders; and
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its affiliates and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee's compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term 
Approved Fund
 has the following meaning:
Approved Fund
 means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and
68
LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register;
provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the 
Participant Register
);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
69
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 9.05.
Survival
. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
SECTION 9.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
SECTION 9.07.
Severability
. Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.08.

Collection Allocation Mechanism
(a)
On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Article VII, (ii) the principal amount of each Revolving Loan and LC Disbursement denominated in a Foreign Currency shall automatically and without any further action required, be converted into Dollars determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the CAM Exchange Date, equal to the Dollar Amount of such amount and on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to any Lender in respect of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder and (iii) the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Designated Obligations such that, in lieu of the interests of each Lender in the particular Designated Obligations that it shall own
72
as of such date and immediately prior to the CAM Exchange, such Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each Designated Obligation. Each Lender, each Person acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by Section 9.04, and the Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange. The Borrower and the Lenders agree from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests and obligations of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes so executed and delivered; provided that the failure of the Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
(b)
As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Designated Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by paragraph (c) below).
(c)
In the event that, after the CAM Exchange, the aggregate amount of the Designated Obligations shall change as a result of the making of an LC Disbursement by the Issuing Bank that is not reimbursed by the Borrower, then (i) each Lender shall, in accordance with Section 2.06(d), promptly purchase from the Issuing Bank the Dollar equivalent of a participation in such LC Disbursement in the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange), (ii) the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such LC Disbursement and the purchase of participations therein by the applicable Lenders, and the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Designated Obligations such that each Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each of the Designated Obligations and (iii) in the event distributions shall have been made in accordance with clause (i) of paragraph (b) above, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another in Dollars as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each LC Disbursement been outstanding immediately prior to the CAM Exchange. Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns in respect of the Designated Obligations held by such Persons and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
Nothing in this Article shall prohibit the assignment by any Lender of interests in some but not all of the Designated Obligations held by it after giving effect to the CAM Exchange;
provided
, that in connection with any such assignment such Lender and its assignee shall enter into an agreement setting forth their reciprocal rights and obligations in the event of a redetermination of the CAM Percentages as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (c).

SCHEDULE 2.02
MANDATORY COST
Where:
E.    is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
5.    For the purposes of this Schedule:
6
.    In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7.    If
requested by the Administrative Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
8
.    Each
Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Associated Costs Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:

(
b)    any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9
.    The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.
10
.    The
Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Associated Costs Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11
.    The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Associated Costs Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12
.    Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Associated Costs Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
13
.    The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrower and the relevant Lenders, determine and notify to all parties hereto any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule 2.02 in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

B) It (to the extent applicable) has the requisite power and corporate, partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by each Guarantor of this Guaranty and the performance by each of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and this Guaranty
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, respectively, enforceable against such Guarantor, respectively, in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).
(C) Neither the execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty, nor the consummation by it of the transactions herein contemplated, nor compliance by it with the provisions hereof will (i) violate any applicable law or regulation or its charter, by-laws or other organizational documents or violate or result in a default under any indenture, material agreement or other material instrument binding upon it or its assets, or give rise thereunder to require any payment to be made by it, or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its assets, other than Liens created under the Pledge Agreements (if applicable). No consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any action by, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained by it in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by it of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability against it of, this Guaranty, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect.
In addition to the foregoing, each of the Guarantors covenants that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any amount payable under the Credit Agreement or any other Guaranteed Obligations (as defined below) shall remain unpaid, it will, and, if necessary, will enable the Borrower to, fully comply with those covenants and agreements of the Borrower applicable to such Guarantor set forth in the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 3.
The Guaranty
. Each of the Guarantors hereby unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, the full and punctual payment and performance when due (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, including, without limitation, (i) the principal of and interest on each Loan made to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (ii) any obligations of the Borrower to reimburse LC Disbursements (
Reimbursement Obligations
), (iii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to any Lender or any affiliate of any Lender under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, (iv) all other amounts payable by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (v) the punctual and faithful performance, keeping, observance, and fulfillment by the Borrower of all of the agreements, conditions, covenants, and obligations of the Borrower contained in the Loan Documents (all of the foregoing being referred to collectively as the Guaranteed Obligations and the holders from time to time of the Guaranteed Obligations being referred to collectively as the 
Holders of Guaranteed Obligations
). Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations arising from Permitted Call Spread Swap Agreements and all other amounts payable under Permitted Call Spread Swap Agreements shall not constitute Guaranteed Obligations. Upon (x) the failure by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, to pay punctually any such amount or perform such obligation, and (y) such failure continuing beyond any applicable grace or notice and cure period, each of the Guarantors agrees that it shall forthwith on demand pay such amount or perform such obligation at the place and in the manner specified in the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or the relevant Loan Document, as the case may be. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that this Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of payment and is not a guaranty of collection. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account.
SECTION 4.
Guaranty Unconditional
. The obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:
(A) any extension, renewal, settlement, indulgence, compromise, waiver or release of or with respect
2
to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether (in any such case) by operation of law or otherwise, or any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(B) any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any such amendment which may increase the amount of, or the interest rates applicable to, any of the Obligations guaranteed hereby;
(C) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, any other guaranties with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any nonperfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for the Guaranteed Obligations;
(D) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any of their respective assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(E) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which the Guarantors may have at any time against the Borrower, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent, any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in connection with any unrelated transactions;
provided
that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
(F) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason related to the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(G) the failure of the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations, if any;
(H) the election by, or on behalf of, any one or more of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, in any proceeding instituted under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) (the 
Bankruptcy Code
), of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code;
(I) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by the Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code;
(J) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of the claims of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations or the Administrative Agent for repayment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;
3
(K) the failure of any other guarantor to sign or become party to this Guaranty or any amendment, change, or reaffirmation hereof; or
(L) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent, any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this Section 4, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder except as provided in Section 5.
SECTION 5.
Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances
. Each of the Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment or termination) shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments and all Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan, any Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable by the Borrower or any other party under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, each of the Guarantors' obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be due and payable in the same currency as such Guaranteed Obligation is denominated, but if currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that such currency (the 
Original Currency
) no longer exists or the relevant Guarantor is not able to make payment in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Guarantor hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of payment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that each Guarantor takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
SECTION 6.
General Waivers; Additional Waivers
.
(A) General Waivers. Each of the Guarantors irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand or action on delinquency, protest, the benefit of any statutes of limitations and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other Person.
(B) Additional Waivers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Guarantors hereby absolutely, unconditionally, knowingly, and expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by law:

(ii) (a) notice of acceptance hereof; (b) notice of any loans or other financial accommodations made or extended under the Loan Documents or the creation or existence of any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) notice of the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject, however, to each Guarantor's right to make inquiry of Administrative Agent and Holders of Guaranteed Obligations to ascertain the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations at any reasonable time; (d) notice of any adverse change in the financial condition of the Borrower or of any other fact that might increase such Guarantor's risk hereunder; (e) notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice thereof as to any instruments among the Loan Documents; (f) notice of any Default or Event of Default; and (g) all other notices (except if such notice is specifically required to be given to such Guarantor hereunder or under the Loan Documents) and demands to which each Guarantor might otherwise be entitled;
(iii) its right, if any, to require the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed
4
Obligations to institute suit against, or to exhaust any rights and remedies which the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations has or may have against, the other Guarantors or any third party, or against any collateral provided by the other Guarantors, or any third party; and each Guarantor further waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense (other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully and finally performed and paid) of the other Guarantors or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the other Guarantors in respect thereof;
(iv) (a) any rights to assert against the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations any defense (legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which such Guarantor may now or at any time hereafter have against the other Guarantors or any other party liable to the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor; (c) any defense such Guarantor has to performance hereunder, and any right such Guarantor has to be exonerated, arising by reason of: the impairment or suspension of the Administrative Agent's and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations' rights or remedies against the other Guarantors; the alteration by the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations of the Guaranteed Obligations; any discharge of the other Guarantors' obligations to the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law as a result of the Administrative Agent's and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations' intervention or omission; or the acceptance by the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations of anything in partial satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations; and (d) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof, and any act which shall defer or delay the operation of any statute of limitations applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations shall similarly operate to defer or delay the operation of such statute of limitations applicable to such Guarantor's liability hereunder; and
(v) any defense arising by reason of or deriving from (a) any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations; or (b) any election by the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations under Section 1111(b) of Title 11 of the United States Code entitled Bankruptcy, as now and hereafter in effect (or any successor statute), to limit the amount of, or any collateral securing, its claim against the Guarantors.
SECTION 7.    
Subordination of Subrogation; Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness
.
(A)
Subordination of Subrogation
. Until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) have been paid in full in cash, the Guarantors (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) waive any right to enforce any remedy which the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent now have or may hereafter have against the Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, and (iii) waive any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent to secure the payment or performance of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other liability of the Borrower to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations or the Issuing Bank. Should any Guarantor have the right, notwithstanding the foregoing, to exercise its subrogation rights, each Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably (A) subordinates any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off that such Guarantor may have to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) and (B) waives any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) are paid in full in cash. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Guaranty, and that the Administrative
5
Agent, the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this Section 7(A).
(B)
Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness
. Each Guarantor agrees that any and all claims of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor hereunder (each an 
Obligor
) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), any endorser, obligor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any of its properties shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment);
provided
that, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may receive payments of principal and interest from any Obligor with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness. Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied (in cash) (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document have been terminated. If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an 
Insolvency Event
), any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any indebtedness of any Obligor to any Guarantor (
Intercompany Indebtedness
) shall be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent for application on any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or to become due, until such Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) shall have first been fully paid and satisfied (in cash). Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by the applicable Guarantor upon or with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior to the satisfaction of all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) and the termination of all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall forthwith deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of the Guarantor where necessary), for application to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Guarantor as the property of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations. If any such Guarantor fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same. Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor.
SECTION 8.
Contribution with Respect to Guaranteed Obligations
.
(A) To the extent that any Guarantor shall make a payment under this Guaranty (a 
Guarantor Payment
) which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by
6
any other Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Guarantor if each Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Guarantor's Allocable Amount (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) and termination of the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
(B) As of any date of determination, the Allocable Amount of any Guarantor shall be equal to the maximum amount of the claim which could then be recovered from such Guarantor under this Guaranty without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law.
(C) This Section 8 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 8 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty.
(D) The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Guarantor or Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.
(E) The rights of the indemnifying Guarantors against other Guarantors under this Section 8 shall be exercisable upon the full payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in cash (other than obligations under any Swap Agreement or Banking Services Agreement, and other obligations expressly stated to survive such payment) and the termination of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 9.
Stay of Acceleration
. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 10.
Notices
. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be given in the manner prescribed in Article IX of the Credit Agreement with respect to the Administrative Agent at its notice address therein and with respect to any Guarantor, in care of the Borrower at the address of the Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement or such other address or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of such Article IX.
SECTION 11.
No Waivers
. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any other Holder of Guaranteed Obligations in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
SECTION 12.
Successors and Assigns
. This Guaranty is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent
7
and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
provided
, that no Guarantor shall have any right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the consent of all of the Lenders, and any such assignment in violation of this Section 12 shall be null and void (provided further that nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit or otherwise restrict any merger, sale or other transfer permitted by Section 6.03 of the Credit Agreement); and in the event of an assignment of any amounts payable under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or the other Loan Documents in accordance with the respective terms thereof, the rights hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with such indebtedness. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each of the Guarantors and their respective successors and assigns.
SECTION 13.
Changes in Writing
. Other than in connection with the addition of additional Subsidiaries, which become parties hereto by executing a supplement hereto in the form attached as Annex I, neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by each of the Guarantors and the Administrative Agent.

EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY AND EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY GUARANTOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY ANY GUARANTOR AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK.

No Strict Construction
. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Guaranty.

SECTION 17.
Taxes, Expenses of Enforcement, Etc
.
(A)
Taxes
.
(i) Each payment by any Guarantor hereunder or under any promissory note or application for a Letter of Credit shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Guarantor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Guarantor may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. To the extent such withheld Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding of Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
(ii) In addition, such Guarantor making a payment hereunder or under any promissory note or application for a Letter of Credit shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(iii) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(iv) The Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with any Loan Document (including amounts payable under this Section 17(A)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 17(A) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Recipient delivers to any Guarantor a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 17(A) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 17(A) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.
(v) By accepting the benefits hereof, each Lender agrees that it will comply with Section 2.17(f) of the Credit Agreement.
(B)
Expenses of Enforcement, Etc
. The Guarantors agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations for any reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Holder of Guaranteed Obligations in connection with the collection and enforcement of amounts due under the Loan Documents, including without limitation this Guaranty.

In the event any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to a Guarantor, such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent) shall be under no obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (ii) to disclose any information which such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (iii) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to such Guarantor.
SECTION 20.

. Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.

At no time before the actual distribution of funds to Participants under the Plan shall any Participant accrue any vested interest or right whatsoever under the Plan except as otherwise stated in this Plan.
11.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY NET SALES
AND EPS RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2012
CHANDLER, Arizona - October 13, 2011 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, analog and Flash-IP solutions, announced today that it expects its net sales for its second quarter of fiscal 2012 ending September 30, 2011 to be down about 9.1% sequentially and be about $340.6 million. On August 4, 2011, Microchip provided guidance of net sales to be down sequentially by 1% to 6% (or $352.0 to $370.8 million). Microchip also announced today that second quarter fiscal 2012 GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately 38 to 40 cents and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately 45 to 47 cents. On August 4, 2011, Microchip provided guidance of GAAP EPS of 44 to 48 cents and non-GAAP EPS of 50 to 54 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. There will be no conference call in conjunction with today's press release.
Our net sales activity in the September quarter did not progress as we originally expected, said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. Entering the September quarter we anticipated that business conditions would continue to be impacted by weak, broad-based demand conditions, but would begin to improve towards the latter part of the quarter from the seasonal Christmas builds in Asia. Instead we experienced incrementally stronger headwinds and saw no seasonal Christmas build, which in turn adversely impacted all of our product lines and sales channels. The overall global economic outlook continues to be poor and is adversely impacting our business as well as the rest of the semiconductor industry.
While we are disappointed with our September quarter results, we continue to see excellent design win traction in
our microcontroller and analog product lines and maintain a strong competitive position. Net sales from our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 10.4% sequentially, and our licensing business was up 6.4% sequentially, both setting new records in the September quarter. Additionally we shipped our 10 billionth microcontroller during the
quarter, added Mr. Sanghi.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, We will provide revenue and full financial guidance for the December 2011 quarter during our November 3, 2011 financial results conference call.
Many investors have seen coverage of the terrible floods that are affecting Thailand, mainly in areas north of Bangkok, said Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's Chief Operating Officer. Our two facilities are located almost 50 miles east of Bangkok, and are running normally and meeting customer demand for our products. While our supply chain in Thailand has been stable, we have taken steps to secure additional inventory to support production needs, as well as adding alternative suppliers to mitigate our supply risk. We are monitoring the situation for the safety of all our employees, while ensuring that our factories in Thailand continue to operate normally to support our customers.
Microchip plans to announce its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 after market close on November 3, 2011. Due to the preliminary nature of the Company's results for the September quarter, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its GAAP and non-GAAP results but will include such reconciliation and related information as part of its announcement on November 3.
Cautionary Statement:
The statements in this release relating to our expected net sales and GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share for the September 2011 quarter, the poor overall global economic outlook and its impact on our business and the rest of the semiconductor industry, excellent design win traction in our microcontroller and analog product lines, maintaining a strong competitive position, meeting customer demand for our products, securing additional inventory to support production needs, adding alternative suppliers to mitigate our supply risk, and ensuring that our factories in Thailand continue to operate normally are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to: any further slowdown in the pace of the economic recovery or any unexpected fluctuations or weakness in the U.S. and global economies, changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy short-term orders from our inventory; changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and our ability to effectively modify our production levels to meet our anticipated needs;

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER
FISCAL YEAR 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
CHANDLER, Arizona - November 3, 2011 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2011 as summarized in the following table:
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $340.6 million, down 9.1% sequentially from net sales of $374.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 10.9% from net sales of $382.3 million in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $79.3 million, or 40 cents

per diluted share, down 20.1% from GAAP net income of $99.3 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.3% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $92.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, down 16.8% from non-GAAP net income of $111.4 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 22.6% from non-GAAP net income of $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), losses on equity securities, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.8 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 5, 2011 to stockholders of record on November 21, 2011.
Our September quarter results are consistent with what others in the industry have reported. The poor economic conditions are impacting the broader semiconductor industry as can be seen from the earnings reports over the past few weeks, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. The overall macroeconomic environment is weak and the Christmas build season did not materialize as expected during the quarter. We saw broad-based weakness across all sales channels in all geographies.
Mr. Sanghi added, We continue to invest in new products and technologies and believe we are well-positioned to gain market share in our strategic product lines as market conditions improve.
Our 32-bit microcontroller business demonstrated strong revenue growth in the September quarter and was up 10.4% on a sequential basis, and was up over 158% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.

Our analog revenue was down only 0.7% sequentially which was significantly better than most of our industry peers. Our analog attach strategy is working well and we are continuing to gain market share in analog, added Mr. Moorthy.
Mark Reiten, Vice President of Microchip's Licensing division commented, Our licensing business achieved a new record in the September quarter producing $22 million in revenue, up 6.5% sequentially and up 27.3% over the year ago quarter. Our SuperFlash technology continues to be recognized as a best-in-class flash technology for embedded applications. We continue to expand the number of licensees that are using this technology at various wafer foundries, as well as fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchip's cash and investment balance at the end of the September quarter was $1.78 billion and grew by $58.1 million during the quarter. Microchip paid a dividend of $66.3 million in the September quarter and cumulative dividends paid have now exceeded $1.5 billion.
While the floods in Thailand have been devastating for its citizens and for many businesses, particularly those north of Bangkok, our two facilities located almost 50 miles east of Bangkok have continued to operate normally, said Mr. Moorthy. We have experienced sporadic issues with our supply chain, all of which have been mitigated by triggering our contingency plans and use of alternative sourcing. We continue to work to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees, while supporting our customers' business needs.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, The macroeconomic conditions continue to be weak, but we believe that the shipment rates in December will be below the consumption rates of our customers. We expect the inventory burn-off to be largely over by the end of the December quarter and anticipate the December quarter to mark the bottom of this industry cycle for revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. We are modeling December quarter revenue to be flat to down seven percent. We expect the March 2012 quarter to be sequentially up in revenue, gross margin and earnings.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Tax events related to IRS settlements, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other one-time tax events are non-recurring events in our business. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income,
and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically,
we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

year's third fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $77.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, down 2.3% from GAAP net income of $79.3 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.0% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $101.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. GAAP net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was favorably impacted by special income of $0.7 million associated with acquisitions occurring in prior fiscal years and $4.1 million from non-recurring tax events.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $85.4 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, down 7.7% from non-GAAP net income of $92.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.9% from non-GAAP net income of $113.8 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.9 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 6, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2012.
Our December quarter results were consistent with the guidance we provided on November 3, 2011 and marked our 85
th
consecutive quarter of profitability, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Microchip entered this industry down cycle about one quarter earlier than most of our industry peers, and we believe that our December quarter results combined with our March quarter guidance confirms that we also expect to exit this cycle a quarter earlier than most.
Mr. Sanghi added, We believe our inventory levels and short lead times, combined with our strong product portfolio, position us well to gain market share in our microcontroller and analog product lines.
Our 32-bit microcontroller business had an outstanding quarter and produced revenue growth of 33.7% on a sequential basis, and was up 137.3% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Despite the challenging environment, this product line continues to demonstrate strong growth as many new designs continue to go to production.

Our analog business produced another good quarter with revenue up 1.75% sequentially compared to other analog companies being down in double digit percentages sequentially. We have continued to introduce a steady stream of new products targeting a broad range of applications and are winning many new customers and designs, said Mr. Rich Simoncic, Vice President of Analog Products.
Mark Reiten, Vice President of Microchips Licensing division commented, Our licensing business posted a new record in the December quarter achieving $23.1 million in revenue, up 4.9% sequentially and up 21% over the year ago quarter. Our SuperFlash technology continues to be recognized as the best-in-class flash technology for embedded applications. We continue to expand the number of licensees that are using this technology at various wafer foundries, as well as fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, The combined inventory position of Microchip and its distributors decreased by 6 days during the December quarter. The inventory on our balance sheet was up 5 days while distribution inventory declined 11 days on a sequential basis. At this time we believe the majority of the inventory correction has been completed for our customers and our distributors
Mr. Sanghi concluded, While the March 2012 quarter will as usual be seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia, we believe that Microchip will start to see the beginning of our recovery from the inventory correction. Taking this into consideration, we expect revenue in the March 2012 quarter to be up between one and five percent and are forecasting sequential improvements in non-GAAP gross margins, operating margins and earnings per share.

amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn-out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), losses on equity securities, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, the related income tax implications of these items and nonrecurring tax events.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items
- - more - -
Microchip Technology Reports
Third Quarter Fiscal 2012

relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 were $338.9 million, up 3.0% sequentially from net sales of $329.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 10.8% from net sales of $380.0 million in the prior years fourth quarter. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was $80.6 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, up 4.1% from GAAP net income of $77.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 38.3% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $130.6 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter.

our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), patent license settlements, non-recurring tax events, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 were $1.383 billion, a decrease of 7.0% from net sales of $1.487 billion in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 was $336.7 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, a decrease of 21.5% from net income from continuing operations of $429.2 million, or $2.20 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 was $383.7 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, a decrease of 17.0% from net income from continuing operations of $462.3 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.
Our March quarter results were consistent with the guidance we provided on February 2, 2012 and marked our 86
th
consecutive quarter of profitability, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. The March quarter was a transitional quarter for us as we returned to sequential growth in revenue, gross margin and profits. We went into this down cycle one quarter earlier than most of the semiconductor industry and we predicted we would come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. Based on the results of many of our industry peers, this prediction has played out exactly as we expected.
Mr. Sanghi added, With revenue up sequentially 3% in the March quarter, our results turned out to be good in an otherwise seasonally weak period impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. On a Non-GAAP basis, gross margin improved by 133 basis points sequentially, operating profit was up by 7.6% sequentially and operating profit percentage was 31.9% of sales. This was an excellent result for a transitional quarter and we believe the results will continue to improve in fiscal 2013. We believe our inventory levels and short lead times, combined with our strong product portfolio have positioned us well to gain market share in our microcontroller and analog product lines.

Our microcontroller business was up 5.5% on a sequential basis in the March quarter, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product line revenue up sequentially, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Our 16-bit business was up 19.3% sequentially in the March quarter, as our business recovered sharply from the inventory correction many of our customers went through over the last three quarters. Despite the broad-based market weakness, our strong design win momentum enabled us to overcome the macro trend and significantly outgrow the market.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory at March 31, 2012 was $217.3 million or 137 days, flat to the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 31 days which is down 4 days from the prior quarter level. As measured in days, our distributors have the lowest level of inventory that they have held in the last ten years.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We entered the June quarter with a stronger backlog position than what we entered the March quarter with and bookings have continued to be good. We expect revenue in the June quarter to be up between 3 and 7 percent sequentially and are forecasting improvements in gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 31, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 17, 2012.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraphs, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our

investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in
understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Financial Results
Page 2
GAAP net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $352.1 million, up 3.9% sequentially from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 6.0% from net sales of $374.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $78.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, down 2.4% from GAAP net income of $80.6 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 20.7% from GAAP net income of $99.3 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $352.4 million, up 4.0% sequentially from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 5.9% from net sales of $374.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter. Non-GAAP net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.3 million higher than GAAP net sales due to the sell-through of inventory held by distributors of Roving Networks at the date we acquired the company not being included in our GAAP results. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $96.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, up 2.7% from non-GAAP net income of $94.3 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 13.0% from non-GAAP net income of $111.4 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first fiscal quarter. For the first quarters of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.1 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on September 5, 2012 to stockholders of record on August 22, 2012.
Our June quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during our last earnings call. The quarter started out strong, but the negative effects of Europe and weaker economic activity in the U.S. led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the mid- point of our revenue guidance, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Non-GAAP gross margins were up 85 basis points sequentially, leading to an improvement in operating profit, which was 32.7% of sales.

Mr. Sanghi added, We were pleased with the strong performance from our microcontroller and analog businesses where revenue from our strategic products of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog were up sequentially. Net sales on microcontrollers and analog were up sequentially 5.1% and 9%, respectively.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited to have closed the acquisition of SMSC today. Now we begin the next phase, which is integrating the two companies together to bring the combined power of these two innovative companies to the marketplace.
Our 16-bit business was up 23.7% sequentially in the June quarter, and up 18.6% from the year ago quarter, to achieve an all-time record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. After a pause in the March quarter, our 32-bit business was up an outstanding 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve another new record. Both the 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses continue to benefit from the many demand creation actions we have taken as more customers who have selected the PIC
microcontroller platform have either commenced production or ramped their volumes. Our design-win momentum remains strong, and while we are not immune to macro business conditions, we continue to outgrow the secular growth patterns for these businesses.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory at June 30, 2012 was $221.5 million or 136 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter level. Inventory at distribution was flat sequentially at 31 days and is very low compared to historical levels. The inventory held on our balance sheet provides very short lead times and allows us to respond quickly to the needs of our customers.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Our September quarter guidance includes SMSC from August 2 to September 30, 2012. Our economic assumptions are that the U.S. economic recovery has stalled, the Europe economic situation will continue to be challenged and China, which has been the engine of growth, is starting to slow down. Based on our analysis, we expect our net sales in the September quarter to be up from 17% to 22% sequentially. This guidance includes estimated non-GAAP net sales of $65 million to $70 million from SMSC products from August 2 to the end of the quarter.

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Due to the closing of the SMSC acquisition just today, we are not able to provide GAAP guidance at this time, as the purchase accounting valuation adjustments related to the acquisition including acquired intangibles and inventory write-up as well as other acquisition-related charges are not known at this time. We are able to provide the following Non-GAAP guidance:

administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, the related income tax implications of these items and nonrecurring tax events.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically,

we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of distributor inventory acquired in an acquisition being recognized as net sales for non-GAAP purposes on sell-through to provide comparability between periods for the results of the acquired company, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Procedure
.
(1)
Multiple Administrative Bodies
. The Plan may be administered by different Committees with respect to different groups of Service Providers.
(2)
Section 162(m)
. To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Options granted hereunder as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more outside directors within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(3)
Rule 16b-3
. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.

(2)
to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder (other than the automatic grants to Non-Employee Directors provided for in Section 17 of the Plan);
(3)
to determine whether and to what extent Awards or any combination thereof, are granted under the Plan;
(4)
to determine the number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent units to be covered by each Award granted under the Plan;
(5)
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
(6)
to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted under the Plan.

(7)
to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;
(8)
to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;

(10)
to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;

to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award (or distribution of a Deferred Stock Unit) that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld (but no more). The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
(12)
to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards; and

. The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants:

7.

8.
Stock Options
.
(a)
Term
. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Notice of Grant; provided, however, that the term shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Notice of Grant.
(b)

(d)
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
. At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. In so doing, the Administrator may specify that an Option may not be exercised until the completion of a service period.
(e)
Form of Consideration
. The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. Subject to Applicable Laws, such consideration may consist entirely of:
(1)
cash;
(2)
check;
(3)
other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option have been owned by the Participant for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;
(4)
delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to the Company of the sale proceeds required to pay the exercise price;
(5)
any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(6)
such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(f)
Exercise of Option
.
Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Option Agreement.
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the optioned stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 19 of the Plan.
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(g)
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participants misconduct, death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
(h)
Disability
. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for six (6) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
(i)
Death of Participant
. If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participants death within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the personal representative of the Participants estate, provided such representative has been designated prior to Participants death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such representative has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participants death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

the difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
(2)
the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

In the absence of a specified time in the SAR Agreement, the SAR shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire SAR, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the SAR shall revert to the Plan.

months following the Participants termination.

If no such representative has been designated by the Participant, then such SAR may be exercised by the person(s) to whom the SAR is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the SAR Agreement, the SAR shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participants death.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
(2)

For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit and
Deferred Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
20.
Date of Grant
. The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
21.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
.
(a)
Amendment and Termination
. The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

Stockholder Approval
. The Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or statute or other applicable law, rule or regulation, including the requirements of any exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted). Such stockholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule or regulation.
(c)
Effect of Amendment or Termination
. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.
22.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
.
(a)
Legal Compliance
. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of the Award or the issuance and delivery of such Shares (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
(b)
Investment Representations
. As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
23.
Liability of Company
.
(a)
Inability to Obtain Authority
. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
(b)
Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares
. If the Awarded Stock covered by an Award exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan without additional stockholder approval, such Award shall be void with respect to such excess Awarded Stock, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 21(b) of the Plan.
24.
Reservation of Shares
. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY NET SALES RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2013
CHANDLER, Arizona  October 15, 2012  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, announced today that it expects its net sales for its second quarter of fiscal 2013 ending September 30, 2012 to be about $407 to $408 million on a non-GAAP basis. On August 2, 2012, Microchip provided guidance of net sales to be approximately $412 to $430 million on a non-GAAP basis. There will be no conference call in conjunction with todays press release.
Our lower than anticipated net sales activity in the September quarter was driven primarily by macro-economic and industry conditions, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. The overall global economic outlook continues to be poor and is adversely impacting our business as well as the rest of the semiconductor industry.
We will provide the details of our financial performance for the September 2012 quarter and guidance for the December 2012 quarter during our November 8, 2012 conference call, added Mr. Sanghi.
Microchip plans to announce its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 after market close on November 8, 2012. Due to the preliminary nature of the Companys results for the September quarter and the complexity associated with the accounting for the Companys acquisition of SMSC which closed on August 2, 2012, the Company is not yet able to provide a reconciliation of its GAAP and non-GAAP revenue at this time, and expects to provide its full financial results and the GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the September 30, 2012 quarter as part of its announcement on November 8, 2012.
Cautionary Statement:
The statements in this release relating to our expected non-GAAP net sales for the September 2012 quarter, the poor overall global economic outlook and its adverse impact on our business and the rest of the semiconductor industry are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to: continued economic uncertainty or any unexpected

fluctuations or further weakness in the U.S. and global economies, changes in demand or market acceptance of our products (including our SMSC products and our licensed technology) and the products of our customers; the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy short-term orders from our inventory; changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and our ability to effectively manage our production levels; competitive developments including pricing pressures; the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter; the level of sell-through of our products through distribution; changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality; foreign currency effects on our business; our ability to realize the expected benefits of our SMSC acquisition; the impact of any other significant acquisitions that we may make; costs and outcome of any current or future tax audit or any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or other issues; our actual average stock price in the September 2012 quarter and the impact such price will have on our share count; disruptions in our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers due to natural disasters (including any floods in Thailand), terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system; and general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.

EXHIBIT 99.1
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and statements of operations are presented to give effect to the acquisition of Standard Microsystems Corporation (Target) by Microchip Technology Incorporated (Company). The pro forma information was prepared based on the historical financial statements and related notes of the Company and Target (which are incorporated by reference in this document), as adjusted for the pro forma impact of applying the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (US GAAP). The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The allocation of the purchase price of the Target acquisition reflected in these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements has been based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma adjustments are therefore preliminary and have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the acquisition.  
The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the transaction as of June 30, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations combine the results of operations of the Company and Target for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and the three months ended June 30, 2012 as if the transaction had occurred on April 1, 2011.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been achieved had the Company and Target been a combined company during the respective periods presented. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 filed on May 30, 2012 and in its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012 filed on August 9, 2012 as well as Targets historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012 filed on April 23, 2012 and in its Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2012 filed on July 3, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared using the purchase method of accounting with the Company treated as the acquiring entity. Accordingly, the aggregate value of the consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Target based upon their estimated fair values on the closing date of the acquisition. As of the date of this Form 8-K/A, the Company has not completed the detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Target and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has the Company identified all adjustments necessary to conform Targets accounting policies to the Companys accounting policies. Additionally, a final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Target will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Target that existed as of the closing date. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price adjustments presented herein are preliminary, and may not reflect any final purchase price adjustments made. These pro forma purchase price adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements required pursuant to Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.  The Company estimated the fair value of Targets assets and liabilities based on discussions with Targets management, due diligence and preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists. As the final valuations are being performed, increases or decreases in the fair value of relevant balance sheet amounts will result in adjustments, which may result in material differences from the information presented herein.
The
Company expects to incur costs and realize benefits associated with integrating the operations of the Company and Target.  The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or any benefits that may result from operating efficiencies or revenue synergies.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Adjustments to the pro forma combined balance sheet:
(a) This pro forma adjustment reflects the pro forma amount of cash paid for the transaction, less $600.0 million financed through the Company's existing line of credit.
(b) The pro forma adjustment to inventory reflects the fair value write-up of acquired inventory at the assumed acquisition date of approximately $50.0 million.
(c)
The pro forma adjustments to deferred tax assets, long-term income taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities reflect the combination of the Company and the Target and the assessment of the tax attributes and tax liability exposure of the Target as of the assumed acquisition date.
(d) The pro forma adjustments to goodwill include the reversal of the Target's May 31, 2012 historical goodwill balance of approximately $113.0 million and the addition of approximately $144.0 million of goodwill as a result of the pro forma purchase price allocation.
(e) The intangible asset pro forma adjustments includes the reversal of the Target's May 31, 2012 historical intangible assets related to prior SMSC acquisitions of approximately $28.0 million and the addition of approximately $518.8 million as a result of the pro forma purchase price allocation.
(f) The pro forma adjustment to accrued liabilities includes the elimination of the Target's historical May 31, 2012 liability for stock appreciation rights in the amount of approximately $40.5 million, based upon the issuance of equity-based awards. Also included in the pro forma adjustment to accrued liabilities is approximately $13.5 million of estimated credits to be granted to distributors on the deferred margin adjustments described in (g) below.
(g) The pro forma adjustment to deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the approximate amount of deferred margin recognized by the Target at May 31, 2012 which the Company will not recognize subsequent to the acquisition.
(h) The pro forma adjustments to equity includes the elimination of the Target's May 31, 2012 stockholders' equity amounts less approximately $6.9 million of transaction consideration related to pre-combination services of the Target's employee unvested shares converted to the Company's shares.
Adjustments to the pro forma combined statements of income:
(a)
The pro forma adjustment to net sales reflects the reversal of revenue recognition for the sell-through of inventory held by the Target's distributors as of the assumed transaction date. The cost of sales related to this adjustment is noted in adjustment (b) below.
(b) The cost of sales pro forma adjustments are as follows:
(c) The research and development expense pro forma adjustments are as follows:
5
(d) The selling, general and administrative expenses pro forma adjustments are as follows:
(e) The pro forma adjustment to interest expense relates to the interest charge on loans from the Company's existing credit facility as a result of the transaction. The interest was calculated using a 2% interest rate on $600 million of borrowings against the line of credit.
(f) The pro forma adjustments to income tax expense are as follows:
(1) 25% is the assumed tax rate of the Target's ongoing business activities.
(
2) 37.5% is the assumed combined U.S. federal and state tax rate of the Target.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES
SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2013 FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING RECORD NET SALES
CHANDLER, Arizona  November 8, 2012  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2012 as summarized in the following table:
Consolidated GAAP net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were a record $383.3 million, up 8.9% sequentially from net sales of $352.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 12.5% from net sales of $340.6 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter.

fiscal 2013 was $21.2 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, down from GAAP net income of $78.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down from GAAP net income of $79.3 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter.
Consolidated non-GAAP net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were a record $407.8 million, up 15.7% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $352.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 19.7% from non-GAAP net sales of $340.6 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter. Non-GAAP net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were $24.5 million higher than GAAP net sales due to the sell-through of inventory held by distributors of SMSC and Roving Networks at the date we acquired these companies not being included in our GAAP results. Consolidated non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $97.7 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, up 0.9% from non-GAAP net income of $96.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 5.6% from non-GAAP net income of $92.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter. For the second quarters of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, restructuring costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), the settlement of certain legal matters of Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (which we acquired in April 2010), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.2 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 6, 2012 to stockholders of record on November 21, 2012.
Our September quarter results were slightly lower than what we had guided during our last earnings call and were consistent with the preliminary results we announced on October 15
th
, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. The macro environment continued to be very weak during the quarter. The negative effects of the European markets and weaker economic activity in the U.S. and China led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than we expected.

Mr. Sanghi added, Our consolidated results including SMSC had several major highlights. First, our overall business achieved an all time record in non-GAAP net sales of $407.8 million. Second, our overall microcontroller revenue achieved a new record. Last but not least, our overall analog business also achieved a record, and at 21.2% of our revenue was the highest it has ever been.
Our 16-bit microcontroller business (excluding SMSC) was up 28.8% from the year ago quarter, although it was down 7.8% sequentially, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Coming on the heels of several strong growth quarters, and the achievement of record revenue in the June quarter, we believe the softness seen last quarter is reflective of the weak macro environment. Combining the 16-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchips 16-bit microcontroller revenue, this business achieved an all-time record for net sales.
Mr. Moorthy continued, Our 32-bit microcontroller business (excluding SMSC) was up 97% from the year ago quarter and down only 0.5% sequentially, demonstrating continuing strong share gains for the business. Combining the 32-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchips 32-bit MCU revenue, this business also achieved an all time record for revenue.
Mr. Moorthy concluded, Our analog business (excluding SMSC) bucked the trend and grew 1.9% sequentially to achieve a new record, and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. Our analog business was also up 13.7% compared to the year-ago quarter.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, We have cut the wafer starts in our fabrication facilities to help curb the growth of excess inventory related to the adverse business environment. The reduction in wafer starts will have a negative impact on our gross margin in the December quarter and is reflected in our guidance provided today. Our inventory at September 30, 2012 was $289.5 million, representing 140 days of inventory. The inventory balance includes $26.2 million of fair value write-up as required for GAAP accounting purposes related to the SMSC acquisition. Inventory at our distributors is at record low levels of about 31 days.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are continuing to see a very weak global macroeconomic environment. We believe that the worldwide GDP growth is decelerating. We are seeing weakness in our SMSC business as well as Microchips microcontroller, analog and memory businesses based on the economic and business environments.

However, in the December quarter, we will have three months of SMSC business versus two months last quarter, which is expected to take our net sales to a new record high at the midpoint of our guidance. Taking these factors into consideration, we expect Microchips total net sales including SMSC to be $396 million to $426 million.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, legal settlements, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in

understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of distributor inventory acquired in an acquisition being recognized as net sales for non-GAAP purposes on sell-through to provide comparability between periods for the results of the acquired company, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

was $10.2 million, or five cents per diluted share, up from a GAAP net loss of $21.2 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down from GAAP net income of $77.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. The GAAP results were negatively impacted by the expenses associated with our acquisition activities as more fully described later in this release.
Consolidated non-GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were a record $416 million, up 2.0% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $407.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 26.4% from non-GAAP net sales of $329.2 million in the prior years third fiscal quarter. Consolidated non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $84.5 million, or 41 cents per diluted share, down 13.5% from non-GAAP net income of $97.7 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 1.1% from non-GAAP net income of $85.4 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, restructuring costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.3 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 7, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2013.
We were pleased with our execution in the December quarter despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Our net sales, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share were all better than the mid-point of our guidance given on November 8, 2012.
Mr. Sanghi added, We achieved an all-time record in net sales of $416 million in the December quarter. Net sales of microcontroller products were up 1.8% sequentially at $266 million, while achieving record sales for 16-bit as well as 32-bit microcontrollers thus exemplifying our continued strength in this market.
Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 12.6% sequentially in the December quarter, achieving a new record for revenue, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. We continue to expand the breadth of the 16-bit solutions we are offering, and customers we are serving, as we continue to gain share in this market.

Mr. Moorthy continued, Our 32-bit microcontroller revenue was up 17.4% sequentially in the December quarter, also achieving a new record. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share.
Mr. Moorthy concluded, Our analog revenue grew 7.7% sequentially in the December quarter to achieve a new record, and our analog business continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue represented 22.4% of Microchips overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest proportion of our revenue ever.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, We made good progress in reducing our inventory position in the December quarter. The actions that we implemented to reduce factory output in the December quarter are bringing inventory levels down and we expect to make further progress in the March quarter.
Mr. Bjornholt added, We had strong free cash flow generation in the December quarter at $123.2 million prior to our dividend payment of $68.7 million. We ended the quarter with $1.77 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, The March quarter has the seasonal effect of the Chinese New Year. However, we are starting to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite activity in our business driven by solid demand and a robust design win pipeline.
We believe the December quarter was the bottom of this cycle for Microchip, and we expect our total net sales in the March quarter to be up between one and four percent sequentially.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, legal settlements, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items

relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of distributor inventory acquired in an acquisition being recognized as net sales for non-GAAP purposes on sell-through to provide comparability between periods for the results of the acquired company, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Consolidated GAAP net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 were $1.582 billion, an increase of 14.4% from net sales of $1.383 billion in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 was $127.4 million, or 62 cents per diluted share, a decrease of 62.2% from net income of $336.7 million, or $1.65 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 were $1.606 billion, an increase of 16.1% from net sales of $1.383 billion in the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 was $388.5 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, an increase of 1.2% from net income of $383.7 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.35 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on June 4, 2013 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2013.
We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Our net sales were above the midpoint of our guidance and our gross margin, operating income and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of our guidance, as we more than delivered on our expectation that the December quarter would mark the bottom for this cycle.
Mr. Sanghi added, Our net sales were up sequentially by 3.4%, fueled by broad based growth across our product lines. Our overall March quarter results were excellent and I thank all the employees of Microchip for their contributions to our success.
Our microcontroller revenue grew 3.7% sequentially in the March quarter to achieve an all time record of $275.8 million, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Microcontroller revenue was also up 20.5% compared to the year ago quarter and for fiscal year 2013 our microcontroller business was up 12.4% compared to fiscal year 2012.

Mr. Moorthy continued,
Our 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 7.7% sequentially in the March quarter, achieving a new record. For fiscal year 2013, our 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 74% compared to fiscal year 2012. Fiscal year 2013 also marks the 8
th
consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 16-bit microcontroller business. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we are offering, and customers that we are serving, as we continue to gain share in this market.
Mr. Moorthy concluded, Our analog revenue grew 4.1% sequentially in the March quarter to achieve a new record, and continues to perform exceptionally well. For fiscal year 2013, our analog revenue was up 89.4% compared to fiscal year 2012, easily one of the best performing analog businesses in the industry. Analog revenue represented 22.6% of our overall revenue in the March quarter, the highest proportion we have ever achieved.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, We made great progress in reducing our inventory position in the March quarter. We ended the March quarter with 116 days of inventory which is in line with our target model. However, our internally produced inventory is still a bit high and the inventory we purchase from foundries is low. We will continue to work on right-sizing the various components of our inventory holdings in the June quarter.
Mr. Bjornholt added, We had strong free cash flow generation in the March quarter at $123.3 million prior to our dividend payment of $69.2 million. We ended the quarter with $1.84 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We have continued to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite requests in our business driven by strong demand and our design win pipeline. The bookings were an all time record in the March quarter. The starting backlog for the June quarter was significantly higher than the starting backlog for the March quarter. However, because of lead-times, many new bookings will be scheduled beyond the end of this quarter. Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchips total net sales in the June quarter to be up between 2% and 6% sequentially

Exhibit 3.1
CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS
OF MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED
The undersigned, being the Secretary of Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware Corporation (the "Corporation"), hereby certifies that Section 2.9 of the Bylaws of the Corporation was amended effective June 13, 2013 by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to provide in its entirety as follows:
2.9
Voting
. The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Each stockholder shall have one (1) vote for every share of stock entitled to vote that is registered in his or her name on the record date for the meeting (as determined in accordance with Section 2.12 of these bylaws), except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.
All elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law or provided herein, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively; except that beginning with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014, a nominee for director shall be elected to the board of directors if the votes cast for such nominees election exceed the votes cast against such nominees election. For this purpose, votes cast shall exclude abstentions, withheld notes or broker non-votes with respect to that directors election. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For the purpose of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
