As described in Item 2.01 of this report, during the period from October 1, 2007 through October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. consummated its restructuring (the "restructuring") by which Visa Canada Association ("Visa Canada"), Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa International Service Association ("Visa International") and Inovant LLC ("Inovant") have become direct and indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. In connection with the restructuring, Visa Inc. entered into the material definitive agreements described below.
The Framework Agreement
As of October 1, 2007, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe") entered into a framework agreement, which governs the relationship between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe after the restructuring, providing for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Inovant, as the licensors, have granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use trademarks and technology owned by the licensors and certain affiliates within the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa payments system. Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will provide each other with transitional and ongoing services similar to those services that were provided among Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Inovant, Visa Canada and Visa Europe prior to the restructuring. Visa Inc. incorporates by reference herein the description of the framework agreement that is contained in the proxy statement-prospectus dated September 13, 2007 (the "proxy statement-prospectus"), included as part of Amendment No. 5 to the registration statement on Form S-4/A (File No. 333-143966) filed with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 13, 2007 and declared effective on September 13, 2007 (the "registration statement") under the heading "Material ContractsThe Framework Agreement."
The Put-Call Option Agreement
On October 1, 2007, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe entered into a put-call option agreement under which Visa Europe provided Visa Inc. with a call option to require Visa Europe to cause its members to convey and deliver to Visa Inc. all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe. In addition, Visa Inc. granted Visa Europe a put option to require Visa Inc. to purchase from the Visa Europe members all of the issued shares of capital stock of Visa Europe. Visa Inc. incorporates by reference herein the description of the put-call option agreement that is contained in the proxy statement-prospectus under the heading "Material ContractsThe Put-Call Option Agreement."

(the "restructuring agreement").
 
As a result of the restructuring through a series of mergers, exchanges and similar transactions, Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Inc. issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to the financial institution members of Visa U.S.A., the financial institution members of the three unincorporated regions of Visa International and the financial institution members of Visa Canada, and to Visa U.S.A., Visa Europe and Visa Europe Services Inc. of a class that corresponds to the applicable Visa region with which each member is affiliated under an allocation method that was agreed upon among the participating members.
Visa Europe remains a separate entity and did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc. in the restructuring. Visa Europe entered into a series of contractual arrangements, as described in Item 1.01 of this report and incorporated by reference herein, that will govern its relationship with Visa Inc. after the restructuring.
The issuance of Visa Inc.'s securities pursuant to the restructuring was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the registration statement.

The Board of Directors
Visa International:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa International and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members' equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa International and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Note 1Organization
Visa International Service Association (hereafter referred to as "Visa International" or the "Company") is a nonstock, nonassessable Delaware membership corporation. The primary business of Visa International is to operate, expand, enhance and support a global payments system. Visa International's primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in this network (collectively, the "members"). Worldwide policy is administered by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company has established regional Boards of Directors for its Asia Pacific ("Visa AP") region, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa ("Visa CEMEA") region, and Latin America and Caribbean ("Visa LAC") region. The regional Boards govern such matters as regional policy, development of new services, admission of new members, establishment of regional fees, authorization of expenditures and adoption of regional regulations. Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe") and Visa Canada Association ("Visa Canada") are separately incorporated regional group members ("incorporated regions") of the Company and each is represented by its own Board of Directors.
On July 1, 2004, the European Union region ("EU region") was incorporated and became Visa Europe, a group member of the Company (refer to Note 4).
In October 2006, a proposed corporate restructuring of Visa International and the separately incorporated regional group members was announced (refer to Note 24).
The Company's consolidated financial statements presented in this report do not include the results of Visa U.S.A., Visa Europe and Visa Canada.
Note 2Significant Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.").
Accounting principles
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned subsidiaries and, if applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company is a primary beneficiary. Minority interest is recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interest and represents the equity interest not owned by the Company. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
Principles of consolidation
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities, including joint ventures, when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. The equity method of accounting is also utilized for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. Under this method, the Company's share of each entity's net income or loss is included in non-operating income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations.
Investments
The Company accounts for investments in entities under the historical cost method of accounting when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less
 
 
than 5%, and does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends from these investments are included in non-operating income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company regularly reviews its investments for possible impairment and estimates the fair value of these investments if there have been identified events or changes in circumstances that may have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments. The fair value estimate typically includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of the investment, the expectations of the entity's cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.
Investment securities, available-for-sale, are held to meet investment objectives such as liquidity management and to promote business and strategic objectives. These securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets. If the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below its cost and the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the cost. Net realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in non-operating income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest and dividends, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, are recorded in non-operating income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has investment interests in various entities and has evaluated these entities for consolidation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46R, . If the Company is a primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity would be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Investments in variable interest entities
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
Settlement due from and due to members reflects the Company's operation of systems for clearing and settling member payment transactions. Settlements generally clear daily among members. However, international transactions involving foreign currency generally settle in two business days, resulting in amounts due from and due to members. The settlement amounts are stated at cost and are presented on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.
Settlement due from and due to members
The Company's accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs ongoing risk evaluations of its customers' financial condition and provides an estimate for uncollectible accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience, the age of the receivable, and current market and economic conditions, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to account collectibility. Uncollectible accounts are charged against the allowance account. Because the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate, it may be subject to adjustment if actual bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company holds cash deposits from certain members in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from card and travelers cheque product clearings. These collateral assets are fully offset by corresponding liabilities, and both balances are presented on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.
Member collateral
The Company maintains short-term money market investments and other marketable securities related to certain long-term executive compensation plans. These
Trading assets and deferred compensation liabilities
 
 
investments are classified as trading assets and are reported at fair value using quoted market prices or broker quotes. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest, and dividends are included in non-operating income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses.
The Company has deferred compensation liabilities which are indexed to certain trading assets. The offset for changes in the fair value of the trading assets related to the vested portion of the deferred compensation liabilities is recorded in personnel expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Premises and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Premises and equipment, net
 
Assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the asset category noted above. Fully depreciated assets are retained in premises, equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until removed from service. Costs for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while major improvements are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life.
The Company initially records intangible assets at cost and assigns a useful life to each asset. Intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs and other intangible assets, all of which have finite lives. The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Intangibles, net
 
Capitalized software includes internal and external costs incurred when developing or purchasing computer software for internal use, and is capitalized in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred until it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the intended function. Thereafter, all qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and, upon the project being substantially completed and ready for its intended use, are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed five years. Qualifying costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed when developing or obtaining the applications, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with developing the applications. All other costs incurred in connection with software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred. The Company reviews capitalized software for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The Company evaluates long-lived assets, such as premises and equipment and finite-lived identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
Impairment of long-lived assets
 
 
expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, a charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations for certain leased properties. The fair value of a liability for the obligation is determined by calculating the present value of expected cash flows which will be incurred to retire the leasehold improvements. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes the cost by increasing the related asset carrying amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its original obligation with the accretion recorded in other operating expense, and the capitalized cost is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the related asset. When asset retirement costs change as a result of a revision to estimated cash flows, the Company adjusts the amount of asset retirement cost allocated to expense in the period of change assuming the change affects that period only, or in the period of change and future periods if the change affects more than one period as required by SFAS No. 154, , for a change in estimate.
Asset retirement obligations
Accounting Changes and Error Correction
The Company's revenue is comprised principally of service fees, international service revenues, data processing fees and other revenues. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, (SAB 104), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, (EITF 00-21) where applicable. Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
Revenue recognition
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
Service fees predominantly represent payments by members with respect to their card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service fees are based principally upon spending on Visa branded cards for goods and services as reported on member quarterly operating certificates. Current quarter service fees are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to prior quarter volumes.
International service revenues are generated when cardholders purchase goods and services in transactions where the cardholder's issuer country is different from the merchant's acquirer country. The fees from these cross-border transactions are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed.
Data processing fees represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement, and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's members globally. These fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.
Other revenues consist of card recovery bulletin fees, product enhancements, risk-related penalty charges, initial membership fees and revenues from certain regional development programs. These fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.
The Company enters into incentive agreements with members, merchants, and other business partners designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. The Company capitalizes certain incentive payments under these agreements related to signing or renewing long-term contracts in instances where the Company receives a commitment from the member to generate a substantial portion of its credit and debit card payments volume for an agreed upon period of time using Visa's branded products. Member incentives are
 
 
accrued based on management's estimate of the members' performance according to provisions in the related agreements. These accruals are routinely reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts and the Company's estimated obligations under these agreements are amortized as a reduction of operating revenue or as part of advertising and promotion expense on either a straight-line basis over the period of benefit or as the performance milestones are achieved.
The costs of media advertising are expensed when the advertising takes place. Production costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising and promotion costs
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and allowable tax planning strategies.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, , SFAS No. 88, , and SFAS No. 106, . The plans are actuarially evaluated, which includes the use of several assumptions. Critical assumptions for qualified pension plans include the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets, which are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies the assumptions as appropriate.
Pension and postretirement plans
Employers' Accounting for Pensions
Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The Company uses a discount rate to determine the present value of its future benefit obligations. The discount rate is based on matching the duration of other corporate bond pools to the expected benefit payment stream.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the Company considers the current and expected assets allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience in excess of the 10% corridor around the larger of assets or liabilities, is recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over the expected average employee future service, approximately 9 years for United States plans and approximately 14 years for United Kingdom plans. The gains and losses of certain smaller nonqualified pension plans are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
The Company immediately recognizes a net settlement loss for previously unrecognized losses when it makes substantial excess pension plan payments.
For each of the Company's foreign operations, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted to U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured to U.S.
Foreign currency
 
 
dollars using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are maintained at historical U.S. dollar exchange rates.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings in other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company uses options and forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted operating expenses and operating revenues. Net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities are hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with SFAS No. 133, . Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the contracts at the contractual rate and the current forward price, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments.
Derivative financial instruments
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Warrants received in connection with equity investments in companies are considered derivative financial instruments if they can be net settled. These warrant securities are not designated as hedging instruments, and are included in other assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other non-operating income (expense), net, during the period of change. Fair value is estimated using a standard option pricing model.
A liability is recognized upon the issuance of certain guarantees and indemnifications, including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee. The liability is measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value included in settlement risk guarantee and other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Guarantees and indemnifications
The Company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. The Company periodically reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to the Company's pending claims and legal proceedings and revises its estimate.
Legal and other loss contingencies
The preparation of the accompanying financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include valuation of investments, capitalized software, pension and postretirement costs, member incentives, legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications, and deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.
Use of estimates
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' balances in order to conform to fiscal 2006 presentation.

Note 3Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 109-2, ("AJCA"). FSP No. 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer as provided for in the AJCA. The Company completed the evaluation of the repatriation provision under this Act in fiscal 2006 and determined that it would not repatriate any foreign earnings under this provision. FSP No. 109-2 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, . FIN 47 clarifies that the term "conditional asset retirement obligation," as used in SFAS No. 143, , refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted FIN 47 on October 1, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. 115-1 and 124-1, , which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP No. 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP No. 115-1 and 124-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FSP No. 115-1 and 124-1 on January 1, 2006. The adoption of FSP No. 115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, . FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It establishes a probability threshold of greater than 50% to satisfy the requirement to recognize a tax benefit. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is in the process of determining the effect, if any, of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, , which amends SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 to require recognition of the
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 
 
overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS No. 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and any remaining transition amounts that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. In addition, the measurement date, the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured, is required to be the Company's fiscal year end. SFAS No. 158 is effective for non-public companies for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2007, except for the measurement date provisions, which are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company plans to adopt both the balance sheet recognition provision and measurement date provision of SFAS No. 158 at September 30, 2007, which represents an early adoption of the measurement date provision. Accordingly, for the balance sheet recognition provision, with respect to the Company's portion of pension and postretirement plans at September 30, 2007, the after-tax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 is expected to reduce members' equity by approximately $19.2 million and $11.4 million for the United States and United Kingdom plans, respectively. For the measurement date provision, for the Company's portion of the United States pension and post-retirement plans at September 30, 2007, the Company is expected to record an after-tax charge of approximately $2.8 million to member's equity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The United Kingdom plans currently have measurement dates of September 30, and therefore no change in measurement date is required for those plans. These estimates are actuarially calculated based on current assumptions for the plans, and assume that there will be no modifications, amendments or other significant changes to the plans. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . This statement allows entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and other items at fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 159 includes an amendment of SFAS No. 115, , and applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 could have on its consolidated financial statements, if any.

Note 4Incorporation of EU Region
In October 2001, the Company's Board of Directors passed a resolution approving the incorporation of the EU region and its admission as a regional group member of the Company. Actual incorporation was subject to favorable tax rulings and no adverse financial effects on the Company. Final Board approval was granted and the EU region was separately incorporated in Delaware on July 1, 2004 as Visa Europe Services Inc. ("VESI"). Upon incorporation, the members within the EU region of Visa International Service Association gave up their membership in the Company and became direct members of Visa Europe, a newly formed United Kingdom private limited company. VESI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe.
 
 
Upon incorporation, the Company transferred all of the assets and liabilities of the EU region to VESI. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction. A summary of the EU region balance sheet at June 30, 2004 is as follows:
 
The consolidated balance sheets of the Company at September 30, 2006 and 2005 do not reflect balances of Visa Europe.
The consolidated statement of operations of the Company for the year ended September 30, 2004 reflects the following amounts related to the EU region:
 
In October 2001, the Company entered into a twenty-year lease agreement for premises to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. As of July 1, 2004, the entire lease was assigned to VESI with the Company acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by United Kingdom property law under the existing lease. In the event of a default by VESI, the Company is obligated to make lease payments. The base rent commitment is 7.5 million each year or $14.0 million in U.S. dollars (based on the September 30, 2006 exchange rate). Rent is allocated based on the square footage occupied by the tenants and was 81.1% for VESI and 18.9% for Visa CEMEA at September 30, 2006 and 2005. VESI agreed to reimburse the Company for any liabilities that may arise under the Company's guarantee to the landlord. The estimated value of this guarantee at September 30, 2006 is $0.2 million.

The Company periodically evaluates its cost and equity method investments for accounting treatment in accordance with FIN 46R, . At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had investments in three and four companies, respectively, that were identified as variable interest entities. The Company was not the primary beneficiary of any of these entities and as such no consolidation was required, although it did have a significant variable interest in one entity. This entity is involved in the development of processing services for smart cards in Egypt. The Company's variable interests in this entity at September 30, 2006 consisted of an equity investment and a lease guarantee and were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the six months ended March 31, 2007, the lease guarantee was terminated and this, together with other transactions and events, led to a reconsideration of the status of the entity with the conclusion that it no longer satisfied the criteria of a variable interest entity.

Note 12Debt
U.S. Commercial Paper Program
The Company maintains a U.S. commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. This program allows the Company to issue up to $500.0 million of unsecured debt securities, with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance and at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no outstanding obligations under this program.
Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company maintains certain revolving credit facilities. The participating lenders in these revolving credit facilities include certain of the Company's members or affiliates of the Company's members. These revolving credit facilities are maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's members, to back up the commercial paper program and, in the case of the three-year facility, for general corporate purposes.
 
 
At September 30, 2006, the Company's revolving credit facilities consisted of the following:
 
Interest rates on the revolving credit facilities are determined at the option of the Company by either an alternative base rate or by a ratings-based pricing grid which uses the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating as assigned by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Interest is assessed at various conventional reference rates plus applicable margins. Facility and other fees associated with the revolving credit facilities were in the aggregate $1.5 million, $2.1 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The credit facilities contain certain covenants and events of default, including financial covenants related to consolidated accumulated net income and other indebtedness, both of which are calculated and reported quarterly. During the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company was in compliance with all covenants with respect to the revolving credit facilities.
As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facilities.
In October 2006, the Company extended the expiration date of the Company's then existing $1.2 billion 364-day revolving credit facility to December 5, 2006. In November 2006, the Company entered into a new agreement (the "November 2006 agreement") for a $1.45 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million incremental facility, both with expiration dates in November 2007. The new credit facilities replaced the $1.2 billion credit facility. Under the terms of the November 2006 agreement, Visa International may request up to three activations of the incremental facility up to a maximum principal amount of $500 million with a maximum expiration date in November 2007. Once activated, the incremental facility is a committed credit facility until the expiration date granted by the lenders. The incremental facility was activated at inception in November 2006, and the commitments under the current incremental facility expire, and any loans thereunder mature, on June 15, 2007. Visa International may make two additional incremental facility activation requests until November 18, 2007.
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at September 30, 2006 and 2005 consisted of the following:
 
 
 
The Company established a medium-term note program in 1992 to offer up to $250.0 million of unsecured private placement notes. The notes may be issued with maturities from nine months to thirty years at fixed or floating interest rates. No medium-term notes were issued in fiscal 2006 or 2005.
Interest expense on the outstanding notes for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $3.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management
Each member is responsible for settlement of transactions with other members. However, under the Company's corporate bylaws, the Company indemnifies members for settlement loss suffered due to the failure of any other member to honor Visa cards and travelers cheques processed in accordance with its Operating Regulations.
Settlement losses are initially borne by the Company and may subsequently be recovered from the region where the member has its principal place of business. Annually, each region is responsible for losses up to $1.0 million plus 0.003% of its total volume for the fiscal year preceding the loss. Losses in excess of this amount are allocated among all regions in proportion to each region's percentage of worldwide total volume. As a result, the Company receives a partial indemnification from its separately incorporated regional group membersVisa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Visa Europefor worldwide losses in excess of the loss sharing allocation.
The Company's indemnification with respect to members' settlement losses creates settlement risk for the Company, due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited. Settlement risk is estimated using the average daily card volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, and the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. The Company's worldwide maximum estimated settlement exposure, after consideration of the collateral amounts set forth below, amounted to approximately $45.0 billion and $40.0 billion at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No material loss related to settlement risk was incurred for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
To manage the settlement risk under this indemnification and the resulting risk to all members, a formalized set of credit standards has been approved by the Visa International Board of Directors. If a member fails to meet any of the credit standards, it is subject to risk control measures such as collateral or trust arrangements. The Company also provides protection to members and merchants who have incurred losses as a result of counterfeit travelers cheques. The Company retains insurance coverage for such losses in excess of $1.0 million to a maximum of $5.0 million.
 
 
Member Collateral
To reduce potential losses related to settlement risk, the Company requires certain members to post collateral in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from card and travelers cheque product clearings. The separately incorporated regional group members of the Company maintain similar collateral requirements for their members. The type of collateral is based on Board-approved standards that include cash equivalents, letters of credit, guarantees and securities. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company held collateral for its members as follows:
 
Approximately $275.3 million and $288.8 million of cash equivalents are classified as both an asset and corresponding liability on the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Settlement Risk Guarantee
The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model. Key inputs to the model include statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for members and country exposures. The model is independently reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to capture recent characteristics of the membership, historical loss experience, and changes in Visa International's global risk policies and procedures.
During 2005, the Company recorded a $44.6 million reduction in its settlement guarantee obligation with a corresponding reduction to expense as a result of management's review of the loss model. Specifically, the historical loss factors utilized in the model were reduced as a result of the Company's low loss history and sustained performance under its global risk policies and procedures. Furthermore, management concluded that it had experienced sufficient economic cycles, loss events and economic incidents to utilize the updated loss factors in its fair value determination, thereby resulting in the reduction in the fair value of the guarantee obligation. As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, the value of the settlement risk guarantee was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Note 14Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Plans
Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered by various contributory and noncontributory benefit plans. The major plans are described below.
United States Plans
The Company sponsors jointly with Visa U.S.A. a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which provides retirement benefits for substantially all of its employees in the United States. Pension plan expense was accrued as actuarially determined under the projected unit credit method. The benefits are based upon years of
 
 
service, age and the employee's final three years of earnings or, in the case of employees hired after September 30, 2002, the employee's final five years of earnings. The pension plan assets are invested in pooled and mutual funds. The Company uses a June 30
th
measurement date for pension and postretirement benefits. Information presented herein reflects this measurement date. The last actuarial valuation for this pension plan was made on June 30, 2006.
The Company made an amendment to its pension plan, effective November 1, 2003. The amendment limits the maximum leave period that may be taken into account for pension benefit purposes to twenty-four months in aggregate. This amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's pension liability.
The Company also participates jointly with Visa U.S.A. in a postretirement plan that provides postretirement medical benefits to its retirees and dependent spouses in the United States who meet the minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from the retirement date until the retiree reaches age sixty-five. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Company's contributions are funded on a current basis.
For the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company made substantial excess pension plan payments and, as a result, was required to recognize its proportionate share of previously unrecognized losses through settlement accounting as defined in SFAS No. 88, The Company's portion of pension plan payments and net settlement loss were recorded in personnel expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and are summarized below:
Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.
 
 
 
The following tables provide an aggregate reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the financial statements related to the pension plan and the postretirement plan of Visa International and Visa U.S.A.:
 
Assumptions used, on a weighted-average basis, to develop the projected benefit obligation for the plans were as follows:
 
 
 
Net periodic pension and other postretirement cost for the plans included the following components:
 
Assumptions used, on a weighted-average basis, to develop the net periodic pension and postretirement cost of the plans were as follows:
 
The expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on long-term historical risks and returns associated with each asset class within the portfolio. The expected return is weighted based on a target allocation and results in a long-term return rate of 7.5%.
The pension plan's target and actual strategic asset allocations at September 30, 2006 and 2005 by asset category were as follows:
 
Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment management performance is benchmarked for each asset base. An independent
 
 
consultant assists the Company with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Plan assets are broadly diversified to mitigate the risk of significant losses. The other asset category includes U.S. cash equivalents that are held to meet the liquidity needs of the plan.
The Company's funding policy is to contribute, annually, an amount between the minimum required and the maximum deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The following table presents the actual contributions made by the Company from its employer assets for fiscal 2006 and 2005 and the expected contributions for fiscal 2007 under its pension plan and postretirement plan:
 
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments:
 
For the postretirement plan, the assumed annual rate of future increases in per capita cost of health benefits was 7.0% in 2006; the rate is assumed to decrease to 6.0% by 2007 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect management's and actuaries' expectations of future rates. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point increase or decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects:
 
 
 
United Kingdom ("UK") Plans
The Company participates in various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans, which provide retirement and death benefits for the Company's employees residing in the United Kingdom. Calculation of pension plan expense is similar to the United States plan. Regular plan benefits are determined based on years of service, age and the employee's highest average eligible salary for any three consecutive years during the last ten years of employment. Pension plan assets are invested in pooled funds. The last formal actuarial valuation for this pension plan was made on October 1, 2004. The projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2006 was based on the October 1, 2004 actuarial valuation, adjusted to reflect assumptions based on market conditions as of September 30, 2006.
As a result of the Visa Europe incorporation in July 2004, the Visa UK pension plan was amended to segregate Visa Europe employees from Visa CEMEA employees. A Deed of Amendment ("Deed") was filed on October 1, 2004. The Deed establishes two sections and defines how the membership within each section is determined as well as how the assets and liabilities are allocated between Visa Europe and the Company. Each section had a separate formal actuarial valuation effective October 1, 2004 to assess the value of the related liabilities and assets. The Deed allows the trustees to consider whether the current investment strategy for each section is appropriate and to make changes. This means that different strategies were in place for the two sections beginning in fiscal 2005.
In December 2004, the segregation of the UK pension plan between Visa Europe and Visa CEMEA was completed and a final assessment was made to allocate the assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2004. Accordingly, the fiscal 2006 and 2005 balances (included herein) reflect Visa CEMEA only.
 
 
The following tables provide an aggregate reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to the qualified and nonqualified retirement plans:
 
Assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation were as follows:
 
 
 
Net periodic pension cost included the following components:
 
Assumptions used to develop the net periodic pension cost were as follows:
 
The expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the long-term historical risks and returns associated with each asset class within the portfolio. The expected return is weighted based on a target allocation and results in a long-term return rate of 7.0%.
The pension plan's weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, 2006 and 2005 by asset category were as follows:
 
Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. The goal of the trustee is to manage the asset classes so that they are within 5% of the target allocation. The target asset allocation is a long-term objective that the pension plan will achieve over the next several years. The investment subcommittee of the trustee reviews the asset allocation on a quarterly basis.
 
 
The Company's funding policy is to contribute, annually, an amount between the minimum required and the maximum deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The following table presents the actual benefit payments and contributions made by the Company from its employer assets for fiscal 2006 and 2005 and the expected contributions for fiscal 2007 under its pension plan:
 
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments:
 
Other Plans
The Company sponsors jointly with Visa U.S.A. the Visa Thrift Plan, a defined contribution plan which covers substantially all of its employees in the United States. Contributions to this plan are funded on a current basis, and the expenses are recognized in the period in which the related payroll expenses are incurred. Personnel expenses attributable to the Company's employees under this plan were $6.2 million, $5.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company made several amendments to its defined contribution plan. The Company reduced employer matching while increasing the maximum covered pay percentage of employee contributions. The Company eliminated the minimum service requirement for participation in the plan and accelerated the vesting period from five years to three years. Finally, the Company eliminated the credited service requirement for rehired employees.
The Company has a nonqualified excess thrift plan and other retirement plans for certain employees. Related costs recorded in personnel expenses were $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
 
Note 15Income Taxes
The Company's income before taxes for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following components:
 
The Company's income tax expense for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following:
 
 
 
The tax effect of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at September 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below:
 
The increase in the net deferred tax assets of $14.1 million was due to various temporary differences including the computation of foreign deferred tax assets during 2006.
The valuation allowance of $0.6 million as of September 30, 2006 related to the California capital loss carryforwards. The California capital loss carryforward period is 5 years. As such, the capital loss carryforwards will expire during fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 through September 30, 2010. With the exception of the aforementioned, the Company's gross deferred tax asset is appropriately stated at a level which management believes is more likely than not to be realized in the future, primarily from the generation of future taxable income.
 
 
The differences between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate, expressed as a percentage of income before taxes, for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:
 
The difference in the effective tax rate between 2006 and 2005 results primarily from a favorable resolution of a portion of a California audit and the reassessment of federal tax reserves partially offset by certain non-deductible expenditures incurred in connection with various strategic organizational matters in 2006.
The difference in the effective tax rate between 2005 and 2004 results primarily from the expected resolution of a California audit relating to the application of a previously issued state ruling, foreign tax refunds received, and the favorable resolution of a federal income tax audit during 2005.
Income taxes payable of $10.2 million and $14.4 million were included in trade and accrued taxes payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries amounted to $7.1 million as of September 30, 2006, all of which are intended to be permanently reinvested. These earnings have been provided for in income tax expense as the distributions are deemed to have occurred under the U.S. tax code.
Note 16Derivative Financial Instruments
The functional currency for Visa International is the U.S. dollar ("USD"). The Company transacts business in USD and in various foreign currencies. This activity subjects the Company to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's policy is to enter into foreign exchange forward and option derivative instruments to manage the variability in expected future cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. These derivative instruments are denominated in the foreign currency in which the exposures are denominated. All derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2006 and 2005 have maturities of less than 16 months and 23 months, respectively. The Company does not use foreign currency option or foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in other current assets or accrued and other liabilities and the resulting gains or losses from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on whether the derivative is designated as either a cash flow or balance sheet hedge.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain operational ("cash flow") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than USD.
 
 
To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between hedging transactions and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses (at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in other comprehensive income (loss), net related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The balance accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), net was not significant at September 30, 2006 and the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount to earnings during fiscal 2007 and 2008 due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.
During fiscal 2006, the Company changed its methodology for effectiveness testing and measurement from including to excluding time value. The excluded time value will be reported immediately in operating revenue or expenses depending on the underlying hedged item. For the year ended September 30, 2006, the amount recorded in earnings related to excluded time value was immaterial.
The Company assesses effectiveness prospectively using regression analysis and retrospectively using a dollar ratio test. Because time value is excluded from effectiveness, the effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward and option contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. In the event there is recognized ineffectiveness or the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the designated hedge period or it becomes remote that the forecasted transaction will occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net on the consolidated balance sheets to other expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. For the year ended September 30, 2006, there were no gains or losses recognized in other expense due to measurable ineffectiveness, failure of an effectiveness assessment or the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.
Balance Sheet Hedges
The Company uses forward rate contracts to economically hedge certain non-functional currency liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in other expense and offsets the change in fair value of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
 
 
The following table provides information about the Company's foreign currency forward contracts at September 30, 2006 and 2005:
 
 
The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Market risk is the potential change in an investment's value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, credit spreads or other variables. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be material. Notwithstanding the Company's efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks (as a result of an offset by the underlying cash flow being hedged) related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2006 and 2005.
Note 17Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as reported on the consolidated balance sheets:
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.
Cash and cash equivalents, settlement due from and due to members, accounts receivable, other current assets, member collateral, trade payables, and accrued and other liabilities
The fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Investments classified as available-for-sale, trading assets and foreign currency forward contracts
The fair value is estimated based on current interest rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms, degrees of risk and remaining maturities. The carrying value of the Company's debt was $39.9 million at September 30, 2006 and 2005. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt was $42.4 million and $43.2 million at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Debt
 
 
Note 18Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company extends credit to its affiliated and non-affiliated members. Collection of trade receivables may be affected by changes in economic or other industry conditions and may, accordingly, impact the Company's overall credit risk. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had receivables from Visa Europe that represented approximately 12.2% and 16.4% of total accounts receivable, net, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total accounts receivable, net, at September 30, 2006 or 2005.
The Company also has significant concentration risk related to its guarantees on potential uncollateralized member settlement losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion.
Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments included short-term investments in debt securities consisting of high credit-quality instruments. The Company has policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure in any one financial institution or type of investment instrument.
Note 19Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The Company's future minimum payments on non-cancelable leases and marketing and other agreements, excluding payments to Visa Resources, at September 30, 2006 were as follows:
 
The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with varying expiration dates. The Company's rent expense on operating leases, excluding rents paid to Visa Resources (refer to Note 9), was $19.9 million, $20.6 million and $32.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has one capital lease for equipment. The net present value of minimum lease payments on the capital lease approximates book value. Imputed interest expense and accrued interest for the capital lease are not considered material.
In March 2006, the Company entered into an eight-year agreement to sponsor the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup, commencing in January 2007. On December 6, 2006, a trial court in New York granted MasterCard Incorporated (MasterCard) injunctive relief against FIFA, with the effect of awarding the FIFA sponsorship contemplated in the Visa-FIFA agreement to MasterCard instead. FIFA has appealed the court's decision, which appeal is currently pending. Until this MasterCard-FIFA litigation is finally resolved or the Company otherwise resolves the matter as between itself and FIFA, the Company's rights and obligations under the Visa-FIFA agreement are not certain. The contractual payments under the agreement total $180.0 million over the eight-year term of the agreement and are payable in annual installments. The payment which was due in January 2007 has been temporarily delayed by agreement with FIFA. No related payments are included in the table above. Visa may realize financial and other remedies from FIFA in the event that FIFA is unable to perform under the Visa sponsorship agreement as a result of the MasterCard litigation.
 
 
The Company leases premises in which, at the expiration of the lease, the Company will incur certain restoration costs such as the cost to remove leasehold improvements. The Company also owns certain computer equipment for which disposal costs will be incurred upon retirement. The carrying amounts of these asset retirement obligations were $2.7 million and $1.8 million as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Activities related to the asset retirement obligations during the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:
 
Contingencies
The Company has incentive agreements with members and other organizations for various programs designed to increase card issuance and acceptance, build payments volume and increase other Visa branded transactions. These incentives are earned by members based on their performance over the term of the incentive agreement, which may range from one to seven years, and are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the related revenues are earned, based on management's estimate of the members' performance as compared to the terms of the incentive agreement. Excluding anticipated revenue to be earned from higher payments and transaction volumes in connection with these agreements, the expected reduction of future earnings in the next seven years resulting from these agreements is estimated to be a maximum of $426.5 million as of September 30, 2006.
Note 20Legal Matters
Visa International is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. These proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages, and the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are not possible to ascertain at present. Accordingly, Visa International has not established reserves for these legal and regulatory proceedings. In addition, under Visa International's membership agreement with Visa U.S.A. and Visa International's operating regulations, Visa International believes it is indemnified against losses with respect to certain legal and regulatory proceedings pertaining to U.S. operations. If Visa International is not successful in its defense of any of these legal and regulatory proceedings, or if Visa U.S.A. does not meet its indemnification obligations or does not have adequate financial resources to fully indemnify Visa International, the Company could incur judgments or fines or enter into settlement of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
 
 
Rule 2.10(e) Litigation
American Express/Discover
On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. (Discover) filed an action against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and MasterCard Incorporated (MasterCard) in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 15, 2004, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (American Express) filed a similar action in the same court against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and certain of their member financial institutions. Both complaints seek treble damages and injunctive relief under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, asserting that Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's Competitive Programs Policy (CPP) prevented banks from issuing payment cards on the American Express and Discover networks. Discover also contends that Visa's "Honor All Cards" rule reinforced the anticompetitive effects of bylaw 2.10(e).
Both lawsuits have been assigned to the district court judge who presided in United States v. Visa (the DOJ Case), in which the Department of Justice challenged bylaw 2.10(e) and the CPP. In the DOJ Case, the court in 2001 enjoined Visa and MasterCard from enacting, enforcing, or maintaining any bylaw, rule, policy, or practice that prohibits members from issuing general purpose or debit cards on any other general purpose card network. In accordance with this court order, Visa U.S.A. repealed bylaw 2.10(e). The court has deferred ruling on whether, or to what extent, it will give collateral estoppel effect in the American Express and Discover cases to factual findings made in the DOJ Case.
The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the American Express and Discover cases. In the fall of 2005, the court granted MasterCard and Visa International's motions to dismiss Discover's attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against them, because Discover did not allege that either MasterCard or Visa International individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims. The court denied Visa U.S.A.'s analogous motion, however, finding that Discover had alleged sufficient market share as to Visa U.S.A. The court also denied Visa and MasterCard's motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' debit card claims, ruling that the plaintiffs had properly alleged a debit card market. Visa's motion to dismiss American Express's exclusive-dealing claim was also denied.
At a hearing on April 25, 2007, the District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of September 9, 2008 for both the American Express and Discover cases. The court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery.
On June 7, 2007, Discover filed a Second Amended Complaint, which eliminated allegations related to the "Honor All Cards" rule, dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against MasterCard and Visa International to conform to the court's rulings on motions to dismiss, and made technical changes to names of the plaintiffs.
Attridge
On December 8, 2004, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and MasterCard in California state court (Attridge). The complaint asserted claims under California's Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law, based in part on Visa's former bylaw 2.10(e). According to the complaint, Visa violated California's unfair competition law by barring members from issuing American Express and other competing cards. Plaintiff further alleged that this action reduced competition at the card and network level and increased the price of general purpose card network services, resulting in less valuable products at higher prices than would have prevailed in a competitive market. Plaintiff seeks restitution, injunctive relief, interest and attorneys' fees. In May 2006, the court dismissed the Cartwright Act claim. On October 4, 2006, the court approved a plan for initial discovery, which is now proceeding. No trial date has been set.
 
 
Interchange Litigation
Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings
In fiscal 2005 and 2006, approximately fifty lawsuitsmost of which were asserted as purported class actionswere filed on behalf of merchants who accept payment cards against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and other defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws by setting interchange rates (among other claims, as described below). The suits seek treble damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees, as well as injunctive and other relief.
On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order establishing a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) in the Eastern District of New York. The Honorable John H. Gleeson was assigned to coordinate pretrial proceedings in the cases transferred to the MDL. On April 24, 2006, a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed, which supersedes the class action complaints filed previously. One additional class action was filed after the date of the consolidated class complaint; it has been conditionally transferred to MDL 1720 but has not yet been made part of the consolidated class. Visa U.S.A. is a defendant in the consolidated class action complaint and nine additional complaints filed on behalf of individual plaintiffs.
The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the setting of interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act; that Visa's "no surcharge" rule and other alleged Visa rules violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act; and that the rules and interchange together constitute monopolization, violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. The consolidated class action complaint further asserts that Visa ties "Payment Guarantee Services" and "Network Processing Services" to "Payment Card System Services" and engages in exclusive dealing, both in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and that offline debit interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act.
The individual complaints include similar claims and also allege that Visa impermissibly ties services for "Premium Credit Cards" to services for other Visa branded payment cards.
On June 9, 2006, Visa answered the consolidated class action complaint and moved to dismiss in part, or strike, claims for pre-January 1, 2004 damages. The parties are currently engaged in document production, written discovery, and non-substantive depositions. No trial date has been set.
Retailers' Litigation
"Indirect Purchaser" Actions
Forty so-called "indirect purchaser" actions have been filed against Visa and MasterCard in nineteen states and the District of Columbia. In these actions, the plaintiffs purport to represent classes of residents of one or more states who purchased goods at merchants that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded payment cards. They claim to have paid higher prices as a result of the purported "tying" and other alleged anti-competitive conduct. The plaintiffs assert claims under state antitrust statutes, state consumer protection statutes, and common law. Visa International is named as a defendant in only six of the cases, all filed in California, asserting claims against Visa International under the Cartwright Act and Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code.
In the California cases, consolidated before the Superior Court for the State of California in the City and County of San Francisco, Visa filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on California Proposition 64, which limits a plaintiff's standing to bring claims under Section 17200. After oral argument, the court denied Visa's motion on March 6, 2007. The California Court of Appeal rejected a petition seeking immediate review of that decision on June 7, 2007.
 
 
Currency Conversion Litigation
State Litigation
In February 2000, an action (Schwartz) was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California in Alameda County against Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard International under California Business and Professions Code Section 17200. The complaint sought injunctive relief and restitution in connection with Visa's and MasterCard's practice of charging United States issuers a 1% "currency conversion fee" on certain credit transactions made in a foreign currency.
In May 2004, a case against Visa International, Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International (Shrieve) was filed in the California State Court for Alameda County alleging claims similar to Schwartz, but related to the 1% "currency conversion fee" imposed on foreign debit card transactions by U.S. cardholders.
In December 2004, a consumer class action complaint (Baker) was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court for the State of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. The complaint challenges the disclosure of the rates used by Visa to convert currency for foreign transactions. Plaintiffs sought restitution and injunctive relief. In January 2006, plaintiffs amended their complaint to add additional claims and expand the proposed class to include all cardholders, worldwide, for whom Visa has converted currencies.
In February 2005, a consumer class action complaint (Mattingly) was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. for failure to disclose the 1% "currency conversion fee" when a U.S. cardholder purchased goods or services in a foreign currency after October 2002.
Federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
More than seventeen federal purported class action lawsuits filed in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and San Francisco against Visa International, Visa U.S.A., MasterCard and various member banks were consolidated into a single suit before Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that the defendants' respective currency conversion processes violated federal antitrust statutes and that the bank- defendants' disclosures to cardholders violated the requirements of the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z.
Currency Conversion Settlement
On July 20, 2006, the parties executed a settlement agreement to resolve all federal MDL and state claims, including those on appeal. Under the agreement, the defendants collectively will pay $336.0 million to create a settlement fund to pay monetary claims by eligible cardholders, the costs of administering the settlement and notice to cardholders, and any court-approved fees and expenses to attorneys for the class and awards to the class representatives. Visa's portion of the settlement fund is $100.1 million. Visa and MasterCard will pay an additional $32.0 million to resolve the claims in the Schwartz matter; Visa's share is $18.6 million. The settlement agreement also includes provisions relating to disclosures on billing statements and other documents. The settlement is not expected to have a material impact on Visa International's financial position or results of operations. The settlement agreement has been preliminarily approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Parke Litigation
On June 27, 2005, a purported merchant and consumer class action was filed in California state court against Visa International, Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, Merrick Bank, and CardSystems Solutions, Inc. (Parke). The
 
 
complaint alleges that Visa's failure to inform cardholders of a security breach at CardSystems Solutions, Inc. in a timely manner constitutes an unlawful and/or unfair business practice under California's Unfair Competition Law and violates California privacy law. The court denied the plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order, except with respect to the defendants' retention of affected account-identifying information, and for a preliminary injunction. In September 2005, the court dismissed the claims brought by the merchants, and on November 18, 2005, the defendants answered the remaining claims.
CardSystems Solutions, Inc. filed for bankruptcy in United States District Court for the District of Arizona in May 2006. The Parke plaintiffs removed the case to United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 10, 2006 and then sought to transfer the case to federal court in Arizona. Visa and MasterCard moved for remand to state court. On October 11, 2006, the court granted the defendants' motion for remand and denied the plaintiffs' motion to transfer the case.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter/Discover
This action was filed in May 2000 before the EU Commission in Brussels. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ("MSDW"), the issuer of the Discover card, challenged Visa International bylaw 2.12(b) which excludes competitor organizations from membership in Visa as anti-competitive. In July 2004, Visa International filed a reply explaining that the bylaw is pro-competitive and enhances intersystem competition. In August 2004, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Visa International's implementation of the rule caused a restriction of competition in the acquiring market in the UK. Visa provided its written response in December 2004. In April 2005, MSDW announced its intention to spin off the Discover card business, and in May 2005, Visa International made further submissions to the Commission in light of the impact of that event on the basis of the Commission's case. MSDW later suggested that it may not spin off the Discover card business.
inter alia
In October 2006, a settlement agreement was reached between MSDW and Visa International. This provides for the withdrawal by MSDW of the complaint to the EU Commission.
ATM Exchange Litigation
On November 14, 2005, ATM Exchange sued Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in United States District Court for the District of Ohio. The plaintiff asserts claims of promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation, alleging that Visa's "deferment" of a deadline for meeting heightened ATM data encryption testing and approval standards harmed the plaintiff by reducing demand for its ATM upgrade solution.
The parties have engaged in written discovery, party and third-party depositions, and expert discovery. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International anticipate filing dispositive motions in the case by June 29, 2007. Trial is tentatively scheduled for September 2007.
Intellectual Property Litigation
Safeclick
An Iowa company called Safeclick LLC ("Safeclick") filed suit against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on December 30, 2003. Safeclick alleged that the "Verified by Visa" program, which authenticates the identity of a cardholder in an on-line transaction, infringes two claims of Safeclick's "Electronic Transaction Security System" patent. Safeclick sought damages under a royalty theory, as well as injunctive relief.
 
 
On December 14, 2005, the Court granted the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. On January 11, 2006, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the grant of Summary Judgment.
On October 23, 2006, the Court of Appeals denied plaintiff's motion and ruled that the District Court had properly granted the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. On November 2, 2006, the parties entered into an agreement to allow this judgment to become final without seeking any further amendment or appeal thus terminating the plaintiff's case.
Starpay
On May 8, 2003, Starpay and VIMachine sued Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claiming that Visa used information provided to it by Starpay in 2000 to create Verified by Visa ("VbV") and to file a Visa patent application on the technology underlying VbV. Two claims are asserted: infringement of VIMachine's patent and misappropriation of Starpay's trade secrets. In February 2006, each party filed objections to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation on claims construction. Once the court rules on those objections and finalizes the claims construction, a case schedule will be set for the remainder of discovery and trial.
Cryptography Research, Inc.
In September of 2004, Cryptography Research, Inc. ("CRI") filed a lawsuit against Visa International in U.S. District Court in California alleging breach of contract, misrepresentation and patent infringement. The lawsuit arises from a 1998 license agreement between CRI and Visa International pursuant to which Visa International received the right to sublicense certain CRI technology for use in smart cards. After the license agreement was terminated, CRI claimed that Visa International was obligated to pay per-card royalties on certain smart cards. In addition, CRI has alleged that Visa International has infringed certain patents claimed by CRI. Discovery in this matter is currently ongoing. A patent claims construction hearing was held on November 8 and 9, 2005. On October 19, 2006, the parties received the first of the eight pending claims construction orders. Fact discovery is ongoing.
On December 11, 2006, CRI filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and California Unfair Competition laws. The court granted this motion on March 20, 2007 and the Second Amended Complaint was filed on March 22, 2007. Visa International filed its answer to the Second Amended Complaint and related counterclaims on April 23, 2007.
Vale Canjeable
On November 21, 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A., filed an action in the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the Visa Vale mark in Venezuela. On November 29, 2006, the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the "Vale" mark by Visa in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers.
In December 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A., also filed a claim with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiff's rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting that the Court: (i) declare the plaintiff is the only authorized user of the expression "Vale" in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers; (ii) prohibit the defendants from using the
 
 
expression "Vale" in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers; and (iii) order the defendants to pay financial damages and legal costs. On March 21, 2007, defendants filed a motion with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas asking them to revoke the preliminary injunction. The Court's decision on this motion is pending.
Note 21Operating Segments
SFAS No. 131, ("SFAS 131"), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on the Company's internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating profit. The Company's Chief Executive Officer is identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as defined by SFAS 131. The Company is primarily structured in geographical segments, and the CODM reviews consolidated financial information related to revenues and operating profit for each of the following three geographic segments: 1) Visa AP, 2) Visa LAC, and 3) Visa CEMEA. The CODM also reviews financial information for the headquarters division, Visa Worldwide Services ("VWS"). Visa AP, Visa LAC and Visa CEMEA provide products and services to their member financial institutions and generate service fees, international service revenues, data processing fees and other revenues. VWS earns service fees by charging cost-based fees to all Visa regions (including separately incorporated regions) based primarily on payments volume. In addition, VWS earns international service revenue from foreign currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multi-currency transactions. Non-operating income (expense), net, primarily relates to interest and dividend income from investments, real estate rental income and equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, offset by interest expense on the Company's borrowed funds at VWS.
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
The reports reviewed by the CODM are based on the Company's internal management reporting process. The presentation of information in the Company's management reports differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") primarily due to intercompany allocations and differences in reporting classifications.
 
 
The following table provides operating segment information as reviewed by the CODM and is reconciled to the consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004:
 
 
 
Amounts in the Reclassifications column of the above table consist of the following:
 
The Company's operations, including revenues, expenses and long-lived assets, are managed on a regional basis and are not tracked by country. The determination of revenues and long-lived assets attributable to specific countries is not practicable and is therefore not disclosed.
Note 22Related Parties

At September 30, 2004, the Company maintained a 90% voting-right interest in Visa Human Resources Service ("VHRS"), a subsidiary of Visa International, which administered certain employee benefit plans and arrangements of the Company. The 10% preferred stock interest held by external parties was valued at $7.0 million, representing 7 shares at $1.0 million per share, and the preferred stock provided for cumulative dividends at a per annum rate of 7.5%, payable quarterly. During fiscal 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150, "," and accounted for this obligation accordingly. In September 2005, VHRS reached an agreement with the holders of the preferred stock for early redemption of the outstanding shares for $8.2 million, which included a prepayment premium of $1.2 million. The premium paid was included in non-operating income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations.

Note 24Subsequent Events
Proposed Restructuring
In October 2006, Visa International and its separately incorporated regional group members (together, "Visa") announced the intention to restructure Visa in order to create a new global corporation called Visa Inc. The restructuring and related activities are subject to approval by Visa members and review by regulatory authorities. It is anticipated that Visa Inc. will be created through a series of mergers involving Visa Canada, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International. Visa Europe will remain a membership association, owned and governed by its European member banks, and become a licensee of Visa Inc. Visa Europe will have a minority ownership interest in Visa Inc. The reorganization will result in a new stock corporation owned by former members of Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Visa Canada. As a part of the restructuring, the board of Visa Inc. will be comprised of a majority of independent directors.
Resignation of Former Visa International President and Chief Executive Officer
In November 2006, Visa International's President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Rodrigues, resigned to pursue other interests. The board of directors appointed the Company's chief financial officer as the President and Chief Executive Officer.
Appointment of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Directors of Visa Inc.
On February 12, 2007, Joseph W. Saunders was named the designated Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Visa Inc. and, on May 15, 2007, the Designated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc.
 
 
Before the formation of Visa Inc., Mr. Saunders began fulfilling the responsibilities of these positions as a designated appointee of Visa Inc. and officially assumed the title of Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer upon the formation of Visa Inc.
Commitments and Contingencies
In March 2006, the Company entered into an eight-year agreement to sponsor the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup, commencing in January 2007. On December 6, 2006, a trial court in New York granted MasterCard injunctive relief against FIFA, with the effect of awarding the FIFA sponsorship contemplated in the Visa-FIFA agreement to MasterCard instead. The impact of this matter on the Company is further described in Note 19.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1Organization
Visa International Service Association (hereafter referred to as "Visa International" or the "Company") is a nonstock, nonassessable Delaware membership corporation. The primary business of Visa International is to operate, enhance and support a global payments system. Visa International's primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in this system (collectively, the "members"). Worldwide policy is administered by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company has established regional Boards of Directors for its Asia Pacific ("Visa AP") region, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa ("Visa CEMEA") region and Latin America and Caribbean ("Visa LAC") region.

Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe") and Visa Canada Association ("Visa Canada") are separately incorporated regional group members ("incorporated regions") of the Company and each is represented by its own Board of Directors.
The Company's consolidated financial statements presented in this report do not include the results of Visa U.S.A., Visa Europe and Visa Canada.
In October 2006, Visa International and its separately incorporated regional group members (together, "Visa") announced the intention to restructure Visa in order to create a new global corporation called Visa Inc. On June 15, 2007, the boards of directors of Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Visa Europe approved a global restructuring agreement that contemplates a series of transactions by which Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Inovant LLC ("Inovant"), a majority-owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A, will become subsidiaries of Visa Inc. The global restructuring agreement contemplates that Visa Europe will not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., will become a stockholder of Visa Inc. and will enter into a series of contractual relationships that will govern its relationship with Visa Inc. The restructuring and related activities are subject to member approval and review by regulatory authorities. As a part of the restructuring, the board of directors of Visa Inc. will be comprised of a majority of independent directors.
In February 2007, Visa International hired Joseph W. Saunders as the designated Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Visa Inc. On May 15, 2007, he was designated as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. and officially began serving in this capacity upon the formation of Visa Inc. in May 2007.
Note 2Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and reflect all adjustments, consisting primarily of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's results for the interim periods presented.
The preparation of the accompanying financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in these financial statements and accompanying notes.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The results of operations for the
 
 
current interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the current fiscal year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
Note 3Visa Affiliates
Visa U.S.A., Visa Europe and Visa Canada are separately incorporated regional group members of Visa International. The results of their operations are not consolidated with those of the Company. The Company provides global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the separately incorporated regional group members. Compensation for these services is based on fees ratified by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company is a party to numerous agreements with these Visa affiliates which allow each company to provide services to the other at negotiated fees. The Company earned total fees from these affiliates for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 as follows:
 
Total fees from Visa U.S.A. represented 9.7% and 13.5% of total operating revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No member accounted for more than 10% of total operating revenue during the nine months ended June 30, 2007, and, other than Visa U.S.A., no member accounted for more than 10% of total operating revenue during the nine months ended June 30, 2006.
Visa International has agreements with Inovant for processing worldwide transactions and other services, primarily related to system development in support of Visa branded products and services. The Company also has agreements for services rendered by Visa U.S.A. and Visa Europe, primarily related to system development in support of Visa branded products and services at negotiated fees. Total expenses for these services, recorded as affiliates services on the consolidated statements of operations, were $150.1 million and $148.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
 
Visa CEMEA is a party to numerous agreements with Visa Europe which allow each entity to provide services to the other at negotiated fees, including the allocation of costs for office premises, which are shared by Visa CEMEA and Visa Europe. Total expenses for premises and various other services provided by Visa Europe were $5.5 million and $6.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company and Visa U.S.A. invest in real estate joint ventures that own, develop, lease and operate certain facilities and properties used jointly by the Company, Visa U.S.A. and Inovant. One of these entities, Visa Resources, allocated $8.1 million and $8.6 million of premises and equipment expense to the Company during the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Visa Resources also manages two buildings owned by the Company. The Company received rental income of $11.0 million and $11.1 million from Visa Resources for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in non-operating income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.
Amounts due from and due to Visa affiliates are settled monthly. At June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had the following receivables from and payables to Visa affiliates included in accounts receivable and accrued and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets:
 
In addition, at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, other liabilities includes an obligation to Visa U.S.A. for $20.0 million related to California income taxes.
In April 2007, member banks in two countries migrated from Visa CEMEA to Visa Europe following the admittance of the two countries into the European Union. In connection with the transfer of these members to Visa Europe, the Company entered into an asset transfer agreement with Visa Europe, and assets related to the Company's operations in the two countries were sold to Visa Europe for a purchase price of $8.0 million. The $8.0 million purchase price is included in amounts due from Visa Europe at June 30, 2007 and was recorded as non-operating income during the nine months ended June 30, 2007, net of the costs of the assets transferred. The assets transferred consisted primarily of intangible assets which had no carrying value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and also included premises and equipment with a carrying value of $0.1 million.
The Company has an uncommitted credit facility with Visa U.S.A. whereby the Company or Visa U.S.A. may provide each other short-term financing with a maximum term of five business days. Neither the Company nor Visa U.S.A. has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company. There were no outstanding balances as of June 30, 2007 or September 30, 2006 under this arrangement.
 
 
In October 2001, Visa International entered into a twenty-year lease agreement for premises to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. On July 1, 2004, upon the incorporation of the EU region as Visa Europe Services, Inc. ("VESI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, the entire lease was assigned to VESI with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by United Kingdom property law under the existing lease. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make lease payments. The base rent commitment is 7.5 million each year or $15.1 million in U.S. dollars (based on the June 30, 2007 exchange rate). Rent is allocated based on the square footage occupied by the tenants and was 81.1% for VESI and 18.9% for Visa CEMEA at June 30, 2007. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa International's guarantee to the landlord. Since the inception of this arrangement, Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee. The estimated value of this guarantee was $0.2 million at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006.
Note 4Investments
Trading Assets and Deferred Compensation Liabilities
The Company maintains its trading assets portfolio to generate returns related to certain deferred executive compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of trading securities are included in non-operating income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the vested portion of the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The vested portion of deferred compensation liabilities, included in accrued compensation and benefits, was $76.1 million and $70.4 million at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.
The dividends, net realized gains and net unrealized gains from trading assets for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
 
Other Investments
At June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, other investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods were $72.9 million and $68.6 million, respectively. The Company evaluates cost and equity method investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may have been a significant adverse change in the fair value of an investment. During the nine months ended June 30, 2007, one equity method investment was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.4 million, which is included in non-operating income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the investment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The Company periodically evaluates its cost and equity method investments for accounting treatment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. ("FIN") 46R, . At September 30, 2006, Visa International had investments in three companies that were identified as variable interest entities. Visa International was not the primary beneficiary of any of these
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
 
entities and as such no consolidation was required, although it did have a significant variable interest in one entity. This entity is involved in the development of processing services for smart cards in Egypt. Visa International's variable interests in this entity at September 30, 2006 consisted of an equity investment and a lease guarantee and were not material to Visa International's consolidated financial statements. During the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the lease guarantee was terminated and this, together with other transactions and events, led to a reconsideration of the nature and status of the entity with the conclusion that it no longer satisfied the criteria of a variable interest entity.
Note 5Intangible Assets, Net
Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 consisted of the following:
 
Capitalized software includes both purchased and internally developed software.
Amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangible assets was $16.1 million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
At June 30, 2007, estimated future amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was as follows:
 
 
 
Note 6Other Assets and Liabilities
Other Assets
Other assets at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 consisted of the following:
 
During the current period, the Company undertook an analysis of capitalized member incentive payments and classified $25.5 million of member incentives as other assets at June 30, 2007 based on a forecast of the amortization of the capitalized amounts. Also, as a result of this analysis, the Company reclassified $21.5 million of member incentives as of September 30, 2006 from prepaid and other current assets to other assets.
Accrued and Other Liabilities
Accrued and other liabilities at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 consisted of the following:
 
Other Liabilities

Note 7Non-Operating Income, Net
Non-operating income, net, for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following:
 
Note 8Debt
Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company maintains certain revolving credit facilities. The participating lenders in these revolving credit facilities include certain of the Company's members or affiliates of the Company's members. These revolving credit facilities are maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's members, to back up the commercial paper program and, in the case of the three-year facility, for general corporate purposes.
As of June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facilities.
The revolving credit facilities consisted of the following at June 30, 2007:
 
Interest rates on the revolving credit facilities are determined at the option of the Company by either an alternative base rate or a ratings-based pricing grid which uses the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating as assigned by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Interest is assessed at various conventional reference rates plus applicable margins.
 
 
The revolving credit facilities contain certain covenants and events of default, including financial covenants related to consolidated accumulated net income and other indebtedness, both of which are calculated and reported quarterly. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 with respect to the revolving credit facilities.
Note 9Settlement Guarantee Management
Each member is responsible for settlement of transactions with other members. However, under the Company's corporate bylaws, the Company indemnifies members for settlement loss suffered due to failure of any other member to honor Visa cards and travelers cheques processed in accordance with the operating regulations.
This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited. Settlement risk is estimated using the average daily card volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, and the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. The Company's estimated settlement exposure, after consideration of the collateral amounts set forth below, amounted to $49.5 billion and $45.0 billion at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. No material loss related to settlement risk was incurred for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.
To manage the settlement risk under this indemnification and the resulting risk to all members, a formalized set of credit standards has been approved by the Visa International Board of Directors. If a member fails to meet any of the credit standards, it is subject to risk control measures such as collateral or trust arrangements. The Company also provides protection to members and merchants who have incurred losses as a result of counterfeit travelers cheques. The Company retains insurance coverage for such losses in excess of $1.0 million to a maximum of $5.0 million.
Under the Company's bylaws and operating regulations, settlement losses are initially borne by the Company. Annually, each region is responsible for losses incurred by the region up to $1 million plus 0.003% of its total volume for the fiscal year preceding the loss. Losses in excess of this amount are allocated among all regions in proportion to each region's percentage of worldwide total volume. The members with their principal place of business in a given region or operating within that region shall be financially responsible for losses incurred by their respective region, after the annual re-allocation described above.
Member Collateral
To reduce potential losses related to settlement risk, the Company requires certain members that do not meet the Company's credit standards to post collateral in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from card and travelers cheque product clearings. The separately incorporated regional group members of the Company maintain similar collateral requirements for their members. The type of collateral is based on Board-approved standards that include cash equivalents, letters of credit, guarantees and securities. At June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company held collateral as follows:
 
 
 
Approximately $332.3 million and $275.3 million of cash equivalents are classified as both an asset and corresponding liability on the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.
Settlement Risk Guarantee
The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model. Key inputs to the model include statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for members and country exposures. The model is independently reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to capture recent characteristics of the membership, historical loss experience, and changes in Visa International's global risk policies and procedures. As of June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the value of the settlement risk guarantee was $0.2 million. Changes in the value of the settlement risk guarantee are included in other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Note 10Pension
United States Plans
The Company sponsors jointly with Visa U.S.A. a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and a postretirement plan, which provide retirement benefits for substantially all of its employees in the United States.
Net periodic pension cost for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 included the following components:
 
The following table presents the actual contributions made by the Company from its employer assets for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and the expected contributions for fiscal 2007 under its pension plan and postretirement plan:
 
 
 
In connection with excess pension plan obligations settled during the nine months ended June 30, 2006, the plan recognized previously unrecognized net losses. These settlement losses were recorded in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Total excess pension plan payments and net settlement losses for the nine months ended June 30, 2006 were $4.5 million and $3.0 million, of which Visa International's portion was $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. There were no pension plan settlement losses during the nine months ended June 30, 2007.
United Kingdom Plans
The Company participates in various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans, which provide retirement and death benefits for the Company's employees residing in the United Kingdom.
Net periodic pension cost for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 included the following components:
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the Company contributed $3.4 million to these plans. The expected contributions from employer assets to the benefit plans for fiscal 2007 are $4.1 million.
Note 11Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 was 42.7% compared to 52.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2006. The effective tax rate is made up of federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes, including the tax effect of non-deductible items mainly related to strategic organizational matters. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income and a resulting decrease in non-deductible items as a percentage of pre-tax income. The effective tax rate also decreased due to the impact of the reassessment of various tax reserves during the nine months ended June 30, 2006.
Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments
The functional currency for Visa International is the U.S. dollar ("USD"). The Company transacts business in USD and in various foreign currencies. This activity subjects the Company to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's policy is to enter into foreign exchange forward and option derivative instruments to manage the variability in expected future cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. These derivative instruments are denominated in the foreign currency in which the exposures are denominated. All derivative instruments outstanding at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 have maturities of less than 7 months and 16
 
 
months, respectively. The Company does not use foreign currency option or foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in other current assets or accrued and other liabilities and, depending on whether the derivative is designated as either a cash flow or balance sheet hedge, the resulting gains or losses from changes in fair value are accounted for accordingly.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain operational ("cash flow") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than USD.
To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between hedging transactions and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses (at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to revenue or operating expense. The balance accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) was not significant at June 30, 2007 and the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount to earnings during fiscal 2007 and 2008 due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.
During fiscal 2006, the Company changed its methodology for effectiveness testing and measurement from including to excluding time value. The changes in time value are now reported immediately in operating expenses or revenues depending on the underlying hedged item. For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the amount recorded in earnings related to excluded time value was immaterial.
The Company assesses effectiveness prospectively using regression analysis and retrospectively using a dollar offset test. Because time value is excluded from effectiveness, the effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward and option contracts based on changes in the spot rate or strike rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate or strike rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. In the event there is recognized ineffectiveness or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet to other expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, there were no gains or losses recognized in other expense due to measurable ineffectiveness, failure of an effectiveness assessment, probability of forecasted transaction not occurring, or the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.
Balance Sheet Hedges
The Company uses forward rate contracts to economically hedge certain non-functional currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in other expense and offsets the change in fair value of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
 
 
The following table provides information about the Company's foreign currency forward and option contracts at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006:
 
 
The currencies underlying the foreign exchange forward and option contracts at June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of British pound, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Market risk is the potential change in an investment's value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, credit spreads or other variables. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be material. Notwithstanding the Company's efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks (as a result of an offset by the underlying cash flow being hedged) related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006.
 
 
Note 13Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The Company's future minimum payments on non-cancelable leases and marketing and other agreements, excluding payments to Visa Resources, at June 30, 2007 were as follows:
 
In March 2006, the Company entered into a global eight-year agreement to sponsor the Federation Internationale de Football Association ("FIFA") and its events, commencing in January 2007. MasterCard Worldwide ("MasterCard") filed suit against FIFA to prevent this agreement from going forward, and in December 2006 a federal court in New York granted MasterCard injunctive relief with the effect of awarding the sponsorship contemplated in the Visa-FIFA agreement to MasterCard instead. FIFA appealed the federal court's decision. During the pendency of that appeal, MasterCard and FIFA negotiated a settlement and the federal court dismissed MasterCard's suit. In June 2007, the Company and FIFA entered into a revised sponsorship agreement. The contractual payments under the agreement total $170.0 million over the eight-year term and are payable in annual installments. The first payment of $5.0 million was made in July 2007 and is included in accrued liabilities on the June 30, 2007 consolidated balance sheet. The remaining payments totaling $165.0 million are included as marketing commitments in the table above.
Contingencies
The Company has incentive agreements with members and other organizations for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and acceptance, and increase other Visa branded transactions. These incentives are earned by members based on their performance over the term of the incentive agreements, which may range from one to seven years, and are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the related revenues are earned, based on management's estimate of the members' performance compared to the terms of the incentive agreement. Excluding anticipated revenue to be earned from higher payments and transaction volumes in connection with these agreements, the expected reduction of future earnings in the next five years resulting from these agreements is estimated to be a maximum of $444.7 million as of June 30, 2007.
Note 14Legal Matters
Visa International is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. These proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages and the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are not possible to ascertain at present. Accordingly, Visa International has not established reserves for these legal and regulatory proceedings. In addition, under Visa International's
 
 
membership agreement with Visa U.S.A. and Visa International's operating regulations, Visa International believes it is indemnified against losses with respect to certain legal and regulatory proceedings pertaining to U.S. operations. If Visa International is not successful in its defense of any of these legal and regulatory proceedings, or if Visa U.S.A. does not meet its indemnification obligations or does not have adequate financial resources to fully indemnify Visa International, Visa International could incur judgments or fines or enter into settlement of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Visa International is presently involved in the matters described below and those described in Note 20 to the audited financial statements included in its 2006 Annual Report.
American Express/Discover
On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. (Discover) filed an action against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International (collectively referred to in this note as "Visa"), as well as MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard) in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 15, 2004, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (American Express) filed a similar action in the same court against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and certain of their member financial institutions. Both complaints seek treble damages and injunctive relief under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, asserting that Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's Competitive Programs Policy (CPP) prevented banks from issuing payment cards on the American Express and Discover networks. Discover also contends that Visa's "Honor All Cards" rule reinforced the anticompetitive effects of bylaw 2.10(e).
Both lawsuits have been assigned to the district court judge who presided in v. (the DOJ Case), in which the Department of Justice challenged bylaw 2.10(e) and the CPP. In the DOJ Case, the court in 2001 enjoined Visa and MasterCard from enacting, enforcing, or maintaining any bylaw, rule, policy, or practice that prohibits members from issuing general purpose or debit cards on any other general purpose card network. In accordance with this court order, Visa U.S.A. repealed bylaw 2.10(e). The court has deferred ruling on whether, or to what extent, it will give collateral estoppel effect in the and cases to factual findings made in the DOJ case.

Visa
American Express
Discover
The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the and cases. In the fall of 2005, the court granted MasterCard and Visa International's motions to dismiss Discover's attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against them, because Discover did not allege that either MasterCard or Visa International individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims. The court denied Visa U.S.A.'s analogous motion, however, finding that Discover had alleged sufficient market share as to Visa U.S.A. The court also denied Visa and MasterCard's motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' debit card claims, ruling that the plaintiffs had properly alleged a debit card market. Visa's motion to dismiss American Express's exclusive-dealing claim was also denied.
American Express
Discover
Fact discovery was completed on May 31, 2007. At a hearing on April 25, 2007, the District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of September 9, 2008 for both the American Express and Discover cases. The court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery.
On June 7, 2007, Discover filed a Second Amended Complaint, which eliminated allegations related to the "Honor All Cards" rule, dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against MasterCard and Visa International to conform to the court's rulings on motions to dismiss, and made technical changes to names of the plaintiffs.
 
 
On July 24, 2007, American Express and Discover served expert reports seeking substantial damages.
Debit/Credit Tying Cases ("Indirect Purchaser" Actions)
Forty so-called "indirect purchaser" actions have been filed against Visa and MasterCard in nineteen states and the District of Columbia. In these actions, the plaintiffs purport to represent classes of residents of one or more states who purchased goods at merchants that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded payment cards. They claim to have paid higher prices as a result of the purported "tying" and other alleged anti-competitive conduct. The plaintiffs assert claims under state antitrust statutes, state consumer protection statutes, and common law. Visa International is named as a defendant in only six of the cases, all filed in California, asserting claims against Visa International under the Cartwright Act and Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code.
In the California cases, consolidated before the Superior Court for the State of California in the City and County of San Francisco, Visa filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on California Proposition 64, which limits a plaintiff's standing to bring claims under Section 17200. After oral argument, the court denied Visa's motion on March 6, 2007. Visa is considering its options for appeal. The California Court of Appeal rejected a petition seeking immediate review of that decision on June 7, 2007.
Currency Conversion Litigation
State Litigation
In February 2000, an action () was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California in Alameda County against Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard International under California Business and Professions Code Section 17200. The complaint sought injunctive relief and restitution in connection with Visa's and MasterCard's practice of charging United States issuers a 1% "currency conversion fee" on certain credit transactions made in a foreign currency.
Schwartz
In May 2004, a case against Visa International, Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International () was filed in the California State Court for Alameda County alleging claims similar to Schwartz, but related to the 1% "currency conversion fee" imposed on foreign debit card transactions by U.S. cardholders.
Shrieve
In December 2004, a consumer class action complaint () was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court for the State of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. The complaint challenges the disclosure of the rates used by Visa to convert currency for foreign transactions. Plaintiffs sought restitution and injunctive relief. In January 2006, plaintiffs amended their complaint to add additional claims and expand the proposed class to include all cardholders, worldwide, for whom Visa has converted currencies.
Baker
In February 2005, a consumer class action complaint (Mattingly) was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. for failure to disclose the 1% "currency conversion fee" when a U.S. cardholder purchased goods or services in a foreign currency after October 2002.
Federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
More than seventeen federal purported class action lawsuits filed in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and San Francisco against Visa International, Visa U.S.A., MasterCard International and various member banks were consolidated into a single suit before the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the defendants' respective currency conversion processes violated federal antitrust statutes and that the bank-defendants' disclosures to cardholders violated the requirements of the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z.
 
 
Currency Conversion Settlement
On July 20, 2006, the parties executed a settlement agreement to resolve all federal MDL and state claims, including those on appeal. Under the agreement, the defendants collectively will pay $336.0 million to create a settlement fund to pay monetary claims by eligible cardholders, the costs of administering the settlement and notice to cardholders, and any court-approved fees and expenses to attorneys for the class and awards to the class representatives. Visa's portion of the settlement fund is $100.1 million. Visa and MasterCard will pay an additional $32.0 million to resolve the claims in the Schwartz matter; Visa's share is $18.6 million. The settlement agreement also includes provisions relating to disclosures on billing statements and other documents. The settlement is not expected to have a material impact on Visa International's financial position or results of operations. The settlement agreement has been preliminarily approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Notice of the settlement began in 2007. In view of concerns raised by putative class members, the court appointed a special master to work with the parties to review and amend, as appropriate, the plan for class notice and distribution of the settlement fund and to determine whether the proposed settlement agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable with respect to all class members. The special master submitted his report on or about July 10, 2007, and recommended that the plan for notice and distribution of the fund be modified. On August 13, 2007, the court issued an order approving the claims procedure recommended by the special master. Revised notices, claim forms and a settlement schedule are to be submitted to the court by August 31, 2007. The court has set a conference for September 20, 2007 to discuss these submissions. On November 8, 2006, the court set a hearing on entry of Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal or the final fairness hearing for November 2, 2007 to review objections to the settlement. However, in light of the special master's report, it is anticipated that the final fairness hearing will be moved to a later date.
Interchange Litigation
Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings
In fiscal 2005 and 2006, approximately fifty lawsuitsmost of which were asserted as purported class actionswere filed on behalf of merchants who accept payment cards against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and other defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws by setting interchange rates (among other claims, as described below). The suits seek treble damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees, as well as injunctive and other relief.
On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order establishing a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) in the Eastern District of New York. The Honorable John H. Gleeson was assigned to coordinate pretrial proceedings in the cases transferred to the MDL. On April 24, 2006, a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed, which supersedes the class action complaints filed previously. One additional class action was filed after the date of the consolidated class complaint; it has been conditionally transferred to MDL 1720 but has not yet been made part of the consolidated class. Visa U.S.A. is a defendant in the consolidated class action complaint and nine additional complaints filed on behalf of individual plaintiffs.
The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the setting of interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act; that Visa's "no surcharge" rule and other alleged Visa rules violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act; and that the rules and interchange together constitute monopolization, violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. The consolidated class action complaint further asserts that Visa ties "Payment Guarantee Services" and "Network Processing Services" to "Payment Card System Services" and engages in exclusive dealing, both in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and that offline debit interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act.
 
 
The individual complaints include similar claims and also allege that Visa impermissibly ties services for "Premium Credit Cards" to services for other Visa branded payment cards.
On June 9, 2006, Visa answered the consolidated class action complaint and moved to dismiss in part, or strike, claims for pre-January 1, 2004 damages. The parties are currently engaged in document production, written discovery, and non-substantive depositions. No trial date has been set.
On July 10, 2007, pursuant to a joint request by the parties, the court entered an amended scheduling order extending the deadline for fact discovery to June 30, 2008, expert discovery to February 20, 2009, and the deadline for completion of all summary judgment and other pretrial motions to March 27, 2009.
GMRI
On June 22, 2007, GMRI, Inc, filed suit against Visa International and various member banks of Visa U.S.A. and/or Visa International in the U.S. District Court for Minnesota. The suit is based on the litigation GMRI previously filed against Visa U.S.A. opting out of the retailers settlement reached in the . Specifically, GMRI alleges that the defendants collectively fixed credit card and offline debit card interchange fees and that defendants conspired in "the imposition of various Anti-Steering Restraints and tying, bundling, and exclusive dealing arrangements on Merchants by Defendants."
In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation
ATM Exchange
On November 14, 2005, ATM Exchange sued Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in United States District Court for the District of Ohio. The plaintiff asserts claims of promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent misrepresentation, alleging that Visa's "deferment" of a deadline for meeting heightened ATM data encryption testing and approval standards harmed the plaintiff by reducing demand for its ATM upgrade solution.
The parties have engaged in written discovery, party and third-party depositions, and expert discovery. On June 29, 2007, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International filed motions for summary judgment on liability and damages. Trial was tentatively scheduled for September 2007. On July 30, 2007, the court vacated the tentative September 2007 trial date. The court indicated if necessary, it would reschedule this date after ruling on the motions for summary judgment.
Intellectual Property Litigation
Cryptography Research, Inc.
In September of 2004, Cryptography Research, Inc. ("") filed a lawsuit against Visa International in U.S. District Court in California alleging breach of contract, misrepresentation, and patent infringement. The lawsuit arises from a 1998 license agreement between CRI and Visa International pursuant to which Visa International received the right to sublicense certain CRI technology for use in smart cards. After the license agreement was terminated, CRI claimed that Visa International was obligated to pay per-card royalties on certain smart cards. In addition, CRI has alleged that Visa International has infringed certain patents claimed by CRI. Discovery in this matter is currently ongoing. A patent claims construction hearing was held on November 8 and 9, 2005. On October 19, 2006, the parties received the first of eight pending claims construction orders. A second and third claims construction order was received on May 4, 2007. Fact discovery is ongoing.
CRI
On December 11, 2006, CRI filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and California Unfair Competition laws.
 
 
The court granted this motion and the Second Amended Complaint was filed on March 22, 2007. Visa International filed its answer to the Second Amended Complaint and related counterclaims on April 23, 2007.
Privasys
On June 20, 2007, Privasys, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. for patent infringement. Privasys alleges that Visa's contactless payment technology infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,195,154, entitled "Method for Generating Customer Secure Card Numbers." At this early stage it is not possible to make any reasonable evaluation of the claims alleged.
Vale Canjeable
On November 21, 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A., filed an action in the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the Visa Vale mark in Venezuela. On November 29, 2006, the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the "Vale" mark by Visa in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers.
In December 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A., also filed a claim with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiff's rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting that the Court: (i) declare the plaintiff is the only authorized user of the expression "Vale" in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers; (ii) prohibit the defendants from using the expression "Vale" in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers; and (iii) order the defendants to pay financial damages and legal costs. On March 21, 2007, defendants filed a motion with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas asking them to revoke the preliminary injunction. This motion was denied on July 11, 2007. Visa International immediately filed an appeal of this decision with the First Instance Superior Court. The court that will hear Visa International's appeal has not yet been assigned.
Note 15Operating Segments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 131, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on the Company's internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating profit. The Company's Chief Executive Officer is identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as defined by SFAS 131. The Company is primarily structured in geographical segments, and the CODM reviews consolidated financial information related to revenues and operating profit for each of the following three geographic segments: Visa AP, Visa LAC and Visa CEMEA. The CODM also reviews financial information for the headquarters division, Visa Worldwide Services ("VWS").
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
Visa AP, Visa LAC and Visa CEMEA provide products and services to their member financial institutions and generate service fees, international service revenues, data processing fees and other revenues. VWS earns service fees by charging cost-based fees to all Visa regions (including separately incorporated regions) based primarily on payments volume. In addition, VWS earns international service revenue from foreign currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multi-currency transactions. Non-operating income, net, primarily relates to interest and dividend income from investments, rental income, and equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, offset by interest expense on the Company's borrowed funds at VWS.
The reports reviewed by the CODM are based on the Company's internal management reporting process. The presentation of information in the Company's management reports differs from U.S. GAAP primarily due to intercompany allocations and differences in reporting classifications.
 
 
The following table gives operating segment information as reviewed by the CODM and reconciled to the consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006:

Note 16Subsequent Event
Change in Visa Retirement Plan
In August 2007, the Company approved changes to the Visa Retirement Plan in the United States and will begin transitioning from a defined benefit driven plan to a cash balance benefit driven plan, effective January 1, 2008. The change to a cash balance benefit formula will take effect immediately for United States employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2007. However, for employees hired before January 1, 2008 (and not rehired thereafter), the current Retirement Plan benefit formula will be grandfathered for a three year period, grandfathered employees will continue to accrue benefits under their current Visa Retirement Plan benefit formula, and their accrued benefits as of December 31, 2010 (the last day of the grandfather period) or the date they terminate employment, if earlier, will be preserved. After that date, employees will not accrue any additional benefits under the current Visa Retirement Plan benefit formulas and all future benefit accruals will be under the cash balance benefit formula.
As a result of the above Visa Retirement Plan change in the United States, the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," previously reported is expected to be reduced. With respect to the Company's portion of the United States pension and postretirement plans at September 30, 2007, the after tax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 is expected to reduce member's equity by approximately $3.1 million as compared to the previously reported amount of $19.2 million in Note 3 to the fiscal 2006 audited financial statements.
 
The Board of Directors
Visa U.S.A. Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members' equity (deficit), comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-14, , during the year ended September 30, 2005.

Note 1Organization
Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa, Visa U.S.A., or the Company) consists of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and its subsidiaries: Inovant, Inc., International Anasazi, Inc., Interlink Network, Inc., Integrated Solutions Concepts, Inc., Debit Processing Services, Inc., Plus System, Inc., Inovant LLC, and Advanced Resolution Services, Inc.
In June 2006 the Company dissolved its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Processing Holdings, Inc. (MPH). MPH held the Company's joint venture interest in Vital Processing Services L.L.C., which was sold in March 2005.
In June 2005 the Company incorporated Advanced Resolution Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A. in order to provide various fraud-prevention and security-related services to Visa members.
The Company has one operating and reportable segment, "Payment Services" in the United States. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa U.S.A. as one operating and reportable segment.
Visa is a non-stock, non-assessable, Delaware membership corporation. The Company operates a payment system that enables consumers and businesses to conduct financial transactions using Visa-branded payment products at physical and virtual points-of-sale and at automated teller machines which are identified by the Visa Brand Mark, Visa Point-of-Sale Graphic or familiar three-band Visa Flag, and other various designs and marks in the United States.
Visa's products and services enable its members to participate in an international payment system that none could offer individually. Visa U.S.A. does not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on Visa-branded cards. Visa U.S.A.'s issuing members have the independent responsibility individually to determine these and most other competitive card features. These functions are performed by Visa member financial institutions in competition with one another. Visa U.S.A. establishes standards and procedures for acceptance and settlement of member transactions. Visa's services allow merchants and consumers to use efficient, secure, and guaranteed payment products in lieu of cash, checks, and other forms of payment. Its relationship is with the cardholder's issuing and merchant's acquiring member financial institutions.
Membership is composed of financial institutions participating in this system. At its April 2006 Annual Meeting, the Company adopted an amended Certificate of Incorporation and amended bylaws which changed the composition of the Board of Directors and clarified dividend, dissolution, membership interest, and voting rights. In accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, members pay service fees each quarter based on payments volume for the preceding quarter. Payments volume is defined as total monetary value of transactions for goods and services purchased, initiated with Visa products, including PIN-based debit, and excluding cash transactions. Members' dividend and dissolution rights, membership interests in the corporation, and voting rights are based on the members' respective cumulative portions of the total of all of certain fees paid to the Company up to the most recent Reference Date as defined in the amended Certificate of Incorporation. The initial Reference Date is May 1, 2006 and members' proportions will be adjusted as of each third anniversary of that date. The Board of Directors includes independent Directors who meet eligibility requirements set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, including the definition of independence from the Company and its members. The chief executive officers of the Company and of Visa International Service Association (Visa International) serve as non-voting directors. Directors other than directors are elected in at-large voting by
ex officio
ex officio
 
 
members in accordance with voting rights and director qualifications set forth in the Company's bylaws. Under the amended Certificate of Incorporation, the directors will serve staggered terms of two years. Members represented on the Board of Directors accounted for 41 percent of total payments volume for the twelve months ended June 30, 2006. Visa members, which are comprised of domestic banks and other financial institutions, represent 100 percent of the Company's payments volume.
In October 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to form Visa Inc. by merger transactions including Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada Association (Visa Canada), and Visa International (Note 20).
Note 2Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Visa and its subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company consolidates entities when it has a greater than 50 percent ownership or when it exercises control. Minority interest is recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company has less than 100 percent ownership interest. Minority interest represents the equity interest not owned by the Company.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications, not affecting net income, have been made to prior period information to conform to the current period presentation format.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include certain revenue discounts and volume-based support incentives, assumptions used in the determination of pension and postretirement costs, discount rates used to present value long-term obligations, and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among others.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Investments with original maturities beyond ninety days and maturing in less than one year are considered short-term investments. Investments with maturities in excess of one year are considered long-term investments.
The Company classifies its debt and marketable equity securities as available-for-sale. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value, based on current market quotations.
 
 
Unrealized gains and losses are reported in Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax. The Company does not engage in investment trading activities. A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. In evaluating other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews sustained declines in market price below the amount recorded for the investment and the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment until recovery, which may in certain cases be maturity. The Company considers the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost and other relevant factors such as the issuer's financial condition, and the Company's investment horizon. Net realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in Investment Income, Net on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield and are included in Investment Income, Net on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned, and are included in Investment Income, Net on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Financial Instruments
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, notes receivable, short-term debt and notes payable to be financial instruments. Except as described in Note 14, the estimated fair value of such instruments as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 approximate their carrying values as reported in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Settlement Receivable and Payable
The Company operates systems for clearing and settling deposit access products. Net settlements are generally cleared daily among its members. However, some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days, resulting in amounts due from and to members. These settlement amounts are stated at cost and presented on a gross basis on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Indemnification
The Company accounts for indemnifications using the framework of FASB Interpretation No. 45 "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45), which requires that an obligation be recorded if estimable, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies issuing and acquiring members from settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other member to honor drafts, travelers checks, or other instruments processed in accordance with operating regulations. The Company's estimate of its liability for settlement indemnification is included in Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and is described in Note 17.
Prepaid Assets
The Company records prepayments of goods and services. The amounts are recorded in Prepaid and Other Current Assets and Other Assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expenses these amounts to the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the period of benefit.
 
 
Investments in Joint Ventures, Affiliates, and Subsidiaries
Investments resulting in ownership of approximately 20 to 50 percent, or in excess of 5 percent of a flow-through entity (e.g., limited partnerships, limited liability companies), are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's share of each entity's profit or loss is reflected currently in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than when realized through dividends or distributions. Other non-marketable investments, resulting in ownership interests of less than these percentages, are accounted for using the cost method.
The Company has interests in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies and has evaluated these entities for consolidation using the framework established by Financial Interpretation 46 (revised), "Consolidation-Variable Interest Entities: Guidance on Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). The Company has determined that its ownership in these entities does not constitute ownership of Variable Interest Entities as defined in FIN 46. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities and has accounted for these investments under the equity method.
Facilities, Equipment, and Software
Facilities, equipment, and software are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to forty years, except for land and construction-in-progress, which are not depreciated.
Depreciation and amortization are provided for facilities, equipment, and software on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:
 
Pursuant to SOP 98-1, "Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," computer software development incurred during the development stage of projects is capitalized. Costs incurred prior to reaching the development stage of projects and other research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company capitalizes purchased software. Capitalized software costs included in Facilities, Equipment, and Software, Net on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to five years.
Costs for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while major improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life.
 
 
Intangible Assets
The Company initially records intangible assets at fair value and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis. Assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated annually to confirm that events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. As of September 30, 2006 the Company had no intangible assets.
Impairment
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," the Company evaluates the recoverability of all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows.
Volume and Support Agreements
Volume and support agreements are incentive agreements with members, merchants, and other business partners designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance. The Company capitalizes certain incentive payments under volume and support agreements related to signing or renewing long-term contracts in instances where the Company receives a commitment from the member to generate a substantial portion of its credit and debit card payments volume on Visa branded products for an agreed upon period of time. Volume and support incentives are accrued based on management's estimate of the members' performance according to provisions in the related agreements. These accruals are routinely reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized costs and the Company's estimated obligations under these agreements are amortized as a reduction of operating revenue or as part of Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion expense on either a straight-line or a sales-volume basis over the period of benefit.
The Company considers any contract where greater than 60 percent of payments are based on sales volume to be predominantly sales-based. Sales-based contracts with expected payments over $10 million are amortized based on estimated forecasted sales volume data. All other contracts with expected payments of $1 million or more are amortized on a straight-line basis. Contracts with expected payments of less than $1 million are accounted for in accordance with the Company's prepaid and accrued liability accounting policies.
Accrued Litigation
The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." These judgments are subjective based on the status of legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel. The actual outcomes of these proceedings may materially differ from the Company's judgment.
Accrued litigation is accounted for using the present value of actual and estimable future payment obligations, discounted at the estimated rate of sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. The current portion of accrued litigation represents the present value of payments to be made over the next year (Note 18).
 
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company's revenue is comprised principally of card service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees, and other revenues. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 "Revenue Recognition" (SAB 104), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" (EITF 00-21). Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
Card service fees predominantly represent payments by members with respect to their card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Card service fees are based principally upon spending on Visa-branded cards for goods and services as reported on member quarterly operating certificates. Current quarter service fees are assessed and recognized ratably over the quarter using a calculation of pricing applied to prior quarter volumes.
Data processing fees represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's members globally, Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe). These fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.
International transaction fees are assessed to members on foreign transactions of U.S.-based issuing banks and domestic transactions of foreign-based issuing banks in cross-border transactions. These fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.
Other Revenues represent optional card enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder and merchant services, software development services, and other services provided to members, Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe. Software development services are provided through Inovant LLC on a time and materials basis primarily to Visa International, Visa Europe, and Visa Canada. Development services are recognized as revenue in the period services are rendered.
For certain programs, the Company records deferred revenue when cash is collected from members in advance and use of the funds is for designated program purposes. Revenue is recognized when funds are used for designated program purposes. Deferred revenue is included in Accrued Liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets (Note 11).
Advertising Costs
In accordance with SOP 93-7, "" the Company expenses the production costs of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Total advertising costs, included in Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $343.4 million, $335.4 million, and $288.4 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Reporting on Advertising Costs,
Operating Leases
The Company evaluates the impact of rent escalation clauses and lease incentives, including rent abatements and tenant improvement allowances included in its operating leases. Rent escalation clauses and lease incentives are considered in determining total rent expense to be recognized during the term of the lease, which begins on the date the Company takes control of the leased space. Rent expense related to lease agreements which contain escalation clauses are recorded on a straight-line basis. Renewal options are considered by evaluating the overall term of the lease.
 
 
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Pension and postretirement plans
The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans within the framework of in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," SFAS No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The plans are actuarially evaluated, which includes the use of several assumptions. Critical assumptions for qualified pension plans include the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans), which are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies the assumptions as appropriate.
The Company uses a discount rate to determine the present value of its future benefit obligations. The discount rate is based on matching the duration of other corporate bond pools to the expected benefit payment stream.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the Company considers the current and expected assets allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience in excess of the 10% corridor around the larger of assets or liabilities, is recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over the expected average employee future service, approximately 9 years. The gains and losses of certain smaller nonqualified pension plans are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
The Company immediately recognizes a net settlement loss for previously unrecognized losses when it makes substantial excess pension plan payments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Positions No. 115-1 and 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" (FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1). FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 address the determination of when an investment is considered impaired and whether impairment is temporary. These pronouncements provide a three- step process for determining and accounting for other-than-temporary impairment, as well as disclosure requirements for reporting unrealized losses. FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 are effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 on October 1, 2005. Additional disclosures required under the pronouncements are included in Note 7. The adoption of FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 did not have an impact to the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
 
 
Note 3Cumulative Effect of Change in Adoption of Accounting Principle
Investment in Visa International
During 2005, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-14, "Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock" (EITF 02-14). EITF 02-14 provides guidance related to investments where the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee and where the investment conveys rights and privileges substantially similar to common stock. EITF 02-14 defines criteria for evaluating whether an investment is "in-substance" common stock. Investments meeting these criteria are accounted for under the equity method if significant influence is deemed to exist.
Visa U.S.A.'s influence over Visa International is demonstrated by its representation on Visa International's Board of Directors, significant related party transactions, and technological interdependence. Dividend and dissolution rights are based upon cumulative volume-based service fees paid by members to Visa International since inception, as a percentage of total volume-based service fees received. Therefore, the percentage of equity ownership fluctuates over time.
In accordance with the provisions of EITF 02-14, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of its equity in earnings of Visa International on prior years through fiscal 2004 of $95.7 million (net of taxes of $54.1 million) in income during fiscal 2005. The amount recorded represents a 33 percent share in Visa International accumulated equity in fiscal 2004. The effect of the change in fiscal 2005 was to increase Income Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle by $9.5 million and Net Income by $105.2 million. These equity estimates are based on a conservative interpretation of "volume-based" service fees. Pro forma amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the impact on prior year results as if the accounting change had been in effect during the periods presented.
Summarized consolidated financial information for Visa International was as follows:
 
 
 
Volume and Support Agreements
During 2004, the Company changed its method of amortizing volume and support agreements with payment terms that are predominantly based on sales volumes. The Company considers any contract over $10 million where greater than 60 percent of the payments are based on payments volume to be predominantly payments volume-based.
For these contracts, the Company has adopted an amortization methodology based on forecasted payments volume and eliminated the straight-line method. This new method of accounting was adopted to more accurately attribute contract acquisition costs to the related payments volume-based revenue.
The Company accounted for the change in the basis of amortization as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the change on prior years through fiscal 2003 was $6.2 million (net of taxes of $4.5 million) and is included in income in fiscal 2004. The effect of the change in fiscal 2004 was to increase Income Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle by $11.8 million and Net Income by $5.5 million. Pro forma amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the impact on prior year results as if the change in basis of amortization had been in effect during the periods presented.
The Company also changed the period of amortization for all volume and support agreements to contract term. Previously, contracts were amortized over the shorter of contract term or estimated life of the underlying card. Based on historical experience, contract term better reflects the useful life of volume and support agreements. The Company accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate. The result of this change in accounting estimate was an increase in net income in fiscal 2004 of $7.4 million.
Note 4Inovant, Inc. and Inovant LLC
On September 30, 2005, Inovant, Inc. sold a 10 percent interest in Inovant LLC to Visa Europe and a 6 percent interest to Visa International and its Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (CEMEA) region at a price equivalent to the founders' cost, which was below the book value of underlying equity in fiscal 2005. Inovant, Inc.'s ownership interest in Inovant LLC, previously 85 percent, was reduced to 69 percent.
Inovant LLC net equity at the time of sale of these minority interests was $97.8 million; the carrying value of the 16 percent minority interest sold was $15.6 million. Cash contributions by new minority owners totaled $2.4 million. Cash contributions were set below book value to compensate new minority owners and settle a dispute with them concerning the earnings of and distributions from Inovant LLC since January 1, 2003. In consideration of their mutual release from claims with respect to these matters, Visa U.S.A. also made payments totaling $3.9 million to Visa Europe and Visa International. These payments and the difference of $13.2 million between cash contributions and the book value of minority interests sold were reflected in Litigation Provision on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2005.
Note 5Visa International, Visa Canada, Visa Europe
Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe are all separately incorporated entities. The Company pays expenses to Visa International and earns revenues from Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe.
Visa U.S.A. Inc. has the rights to various designs and marks by virtue of its membership in Visa International. Visa International is a membership corporation, which administers a worldwide payment system through various card products, automated teller machines, point-of-sale devices, and travelers checks, which are identified by the Visa Brand Mark, Visa Point-of-Sale Graphic, or familiar three-band Visa Flag, and various other designs and marks.
 
 
The Company pays fees to Visa International, based on retail sales volume, exclusive of online PIN-based debit, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, and global electronic payment systems. Voting rights in Visa International are based on annual payment service volume. Dividend and dissolution rights are based on cumulative service fees paid to Visa International. Visa U.S.A. members accounted for approximately 35.5 percent, 35.9 percent, and 37.9 percent of Visa International's annual volume during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Under current Visa International bylaws, no more than eight directors from the Visa U.S.A. membership can be elected or appointed to the current twenty-three-member Visa International Board of Directors. Amendment of the Visa International bylaws relating to allocation of directors requires an affirmative vote of at least 90 percent of the total membership of the Board of Directors.
A summary of the major expenses paid to Visa International is as follows:
 
Visa U.S.A. Inc. operates a proprietary network, VisaNet, that links issuers and acquirers for transaction processing services. Processing services are provided through Visa's majority-owned subsidiary, Inovant LLC.

As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had receivables of $20.0 million and $16.4 million, respectively, from Visa International related to income taxes. This balance is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
 
The Company has an uncommitted credit facility with Visa International whereby the Company or Visa International may provide each other short-term financing with a maximum term of five business days. Neither the Company nor Visa International has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company. There were no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2006 or September 30, 2005 under this arrangement.
Note 6Prepaid and Other Current Assets
Prepaid and Other Current Assets is comprised of the following:
 
Note 7Investments
Available-for-sale investment securities, which are recorded at fair value, consist of marketable debt securities issued by government-sponsored entities, tax-exempt municipal bonds, and mutual fund investments in equity securities. The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of available-for-sale securities are as follows:
 
 
 
The contractual maturity of available-for-sale debt securities regardless of their balance sheet classification is as follows:
 
Investments with a fair market value less than cost as of September 30, 2006 are as follows:
 
The unrealized losses on investments in government-sponsored entities and tax-exempt municipal bonds are caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of the initial issuance of the securities. As of September 30, 2006, a total of 89 investments in government-sponsored entities and tax-exempt municipal bonds are in an unrealized loss position. Because management has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be to maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2006.
Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by reductions in personnel expense. Unrealized losses on equity securities were caused by changes in market conditions. As of September 30, 2006, a total of 8 fund investments are in an unrealized loss position. The Company has not identified any events or changes in circumstances that may have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of investments in equity securities. Based on an evaluation of the near-term prospects of these investments and management's ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2006.
Note 8Investments in Joint Ventures
Real Estate Joint Ventures
The Company and Visa International invest in joint ventures that own, lease, develop, and operate all facilities and properties used jointly by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International.

Outstanding notes for VLD I and VLD II have an interest rate of 8.28 percent and 7.83 percent, and mature in September 2014 and 2015, respectively. Debt issuance and other costs totaling $3.0 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes, which approximates amortization under the effective interest method. Interest
 
 
expense on the outstanding notes in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $4.1 million, $4.4 million, and $4.6 million, respectively. The future principal debt payments for these notes are listed below.
 
Visa Resources charges the combined costs of facilities and equipment to the Company and Visa International based primarily upon the percentage of the total square footage occupied by each entity in the shared premises. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company was allocated 83 percent, 81 percent, and 80 percent of these expenses, respectively.

Note 9Facilities, Equipment, and Software, Net
Facilities, Equipment, and Software, Net consisted of the following:
 
In fiscal 2006, the Company terminated a software development project designed to develop an exception management solution for debit processing that would replace its legacy Transaction Exception System. The Company consolidated all exception management solutions under its Visa Resolve OnLine platform, a web-based transaction dispute management program. This decision eliminated the need for a separate platform for debit exception processing. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $3.5 million in May 2006 for work completed to date. At the time of this decision, the asset was still in development and included in construction-in-progress. The impairment charge is reflected in Network, EDP, and Communications and Professional and Consulting Fees on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2006.
The Company entered into various equipment capital leases during 2005. The total amount capitalized was $11.1 million as of September 30, 2005. Accumulated depreciation as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 was $3.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company's future obligations related to these capital leases are discussed in Note 17.
In 2005, the Company identified certain components of its legacy Visa access point technology where future use of the components was unlikely due to anticipated routine upgrades of access point technology. As a result, the Company recognized a full impairment of $0.7 million for these components in Network, EDP, and Communications on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2005.
In 2005, the Company also identified data storage equipment that became obsolete due to adoption of a more cost-effective alternative to store this data. The Company does not have an alternative use for the equipment. As a result, the Company recognized a full impairment of $0.6 million in Network, EDP, and Communications on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2005.
In 2003, the Company deployed Smart Rewards Platform (SRP) Software and related development costs were capitalized. In March 2004, as a result of a merchant decision to discontinue the Smart Rewards program and a shift in the Company's strategy with respect to chip-based products, the Company recognized a full
 
 
impairment of $5.0 million of the SRP asset and other software licenses purchased as part of SRP development to Administrative and Other Expense. Related amortization charged to Network, EDP, and Communications in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $0.6 million in fiscal 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expense for facilities, equipment, and software totaled $123.4 million, $118.5 million, and $98.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Included in those amounts are amortization expense on internally developed software of $20.1 million, $22.4 million, and $16.6 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Future amortization of internally developed software is shown on the following table:
 
Note 10Intangible Assets
On January 31, 2003 the Company entered into an exclusive ten-year licensing agreement with a member. The agreement granted Visa patent and know-how rights, which allowed the Company to market and distribute Mini Cards within the United States. The license granted was sub-licensable.
In June 2006 the Company assessed a low probability of future incremental cash flows from the Mini Card, given the Company's strategic focus on developing next-generation payment platforms and services, and minimal Mini Card issuance by Visa members. If the sum of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows.
As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $13.2 million in June 2006 for the net carrying value of the asset. The expense is reflected in Administrative and Other on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Related amortization, also included in Administrative and Other, was $1.5 million, $2.0 million, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
As of September 30, 2006 the Company has no intangible assets (other than capitalized software) on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2005, the carrying value of the license was $14.7 million, net of accumulated amortization of $5.3 million.
 
 
Note 11Accrued Liabilities
Accrued Liabilities is comprised of the following:
 
Note 12Restricted Assets and Liabilities
Member Collateral
Under the corporate bylaws, Visa indemnifies issuing and acquiring members for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other member to honor drafts processed in accordance with the Operating Regulations. To reduce this risk, the Company obtains collateral from members, as needed, in order to ensure a member's performance of its settlement obligations. This collateral is generally in the form of cash equivalents, securities, and letters of credit. The Company held collateral as follows:
 
The Cash Equivalents are reflected in Current Assets and Current Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are held in escrow in the Company's name. The Securities and Letters of Credit are held by third parties in trust for the Company and the members, and have been excluded from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Utilities Card Acceptance Program
In April 2005, the Company introduced a program that supports card product usage for selected utilities that meet certain acceptance standards. The program is funded by debit issuers at the time of settlement, to support efforts on their behalf to secure utility merchant acceptance and promote debit products usage. Under current program rules, unused funds, if any, would be returned to debit issuers at the conclusion of the program. The balance for the program was $2.3 million and $0.2 million as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is reflected in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Investment Securities, and Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
 
In August 2006, the Company announced its intention to end the Utilities Card Acceptance Program in April 2007. Under current program rules, unused funds from the program, if any, will be returned to issuers by September 30, 2007.
Visa Check Card Acceptance Program
In January 2004, the Company introduced a program that supports Visa Check card usage and other business arrangements for selected merchants that meet certain acceptance standards. The program is funded by Visa Check card issuers at the time of settlement, to support efforts on their behalf to secure merchant acceptance and promote card usage. Under current program rules, unused funds, if any, would be returned to issuers at the conclusion of the program.
The balance for the program was $74.5 million and $230.1 million as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is reflected in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Investment Securities, and Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In August 2006, the Company announced its intention to end the Visa Check Card Acceptance Program in April 2007. Under current program rules, unused funds from the program, if any, will be returned to issuers by September 30, 2007.
Cash Collateral for Standby Letter of Credit
In May 2004, the Company obtained an irrevocable standby letter of credit (Letter of Credit). The fully collateralized Letter of Credit was established as required by the First Amendment and Waiver to the Company's Note Purchase Agreements for the benefit of the holders of the Company's Series A and Series B Notes. During March 2006, certain financial covenant requirements under the First Amendment and Waiver to the Note Purchase Agreements were met. As a result, the Company is no longer obligated to retain a letter of credit. Cash collateral of $0.0 million and $37.6 million were restricted as part of this standby letter of credit and included in Cash and Cash Equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Note 13Pension, Postretirement, and Other Benefits
The Company participates in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, which provide for retirement benefits for Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International employees residing in the United States. The benefits are based on years of service, age, and the employee's final three years of earnings, and for employees hired after September 30, 2002, the employee's final five years of earnings. Pension plan expense is accrued as actuarially determined under the Projected Unit Credit Method. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum and no more than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. The pension plan assets are invested in pooled and mutual funds and separate accounts.
During 2004, the pension plan was amended to limit the maximum leave period that may be taken into account for pension benefit purposes to twenty-four months in aggregate. This amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's pension liability.
As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, pension obligations were settled totaling $5.3 million and $11.4 million, respectively. In connection with pension obligation settlements, the plan recognized previously
 
 
unrecognized net losses on supplemental pension plan assets of $3.1 million, $12.5 million, and $37.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Visa U.S.A.'s share of pension plan settlement losses was $1.8 million, $8.9 million, and $25.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The net settlement losses on plan assets are recorded in Personnel expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company also participates in a postretirement benefit plan that provides medical benefits for Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age sixty-five. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Company's contributions are funded on a current basis.
The following tables provide an aggregate reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status, and amounts recognized in Visa U.S.A. Inc., and Visa International's collective financial statements related to the regular retirement plan and the supplemental retirement plan (which primarily covers key executives), and those of the postretirement plan.
 
 
 
Net periodic pension and other postretirement plan cost included the following components:
 
Assumptions used in the accounting for the plans on a weighted-average basis were as follows:
 
Two of the principal components of the net periodic pension calculation are the discount rate on future liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The Company uses a "bond duration matching" methodology to calculate the discount rate. Under this approach, the discount rate is determined by projecting the plans' expected future benefit payments, as defined for the projected benefit obligations, and by discounting those expected payments using an average of yield curves constructed based on a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the long-term historical risk and returns associated with each asset class within the portfolio. The expected return is weighted based on the targeted allocation and results in a return rate of 7.5 percent. The use of an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in pension income returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on plan assets in any given year.
 
 
The expected long-term rate of return is intended to approximate the actual long-term rate of return over time. The Company generally holds the expected long-term rate of return constant so the pattern of income and expense recognition more closely matches the more stable pattern of services provided by employees over the life of the Company's pension obligation. To determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable, the Company considers such factors as:
 
 
 
 
Any difference between actual and expected plan experience including asset return experience in excess of a 10 percent corridor around the larger of assets or liabilities is recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over the expected average future working lifetime of the current employees, which is currently 8.6 years.
Company contributions under the pension plans included $59.6 million and $126.0 million paid from employer assets in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Employer contributions under the postretirement plan include $2.9 million and $2.8 million paid from employer assets in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The pension plan's weighted-average asset allocations as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 by asset category were as follows:
 
Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Plan assets are broadly diversified to minimize the risk of loss. The other category includes cash that is available to meet expected benefit payments and expenses.
 
 
Expected Cash Flows
Information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans follows:
 
Expected contributions include pension benefits of $51.0 million and other postretirement benefits of $3.7 million expected to be paid from employer assets in fiscal 2007.
The assumed annual rate of future increases in per capita cost of health benefits for the postretirement plan was 7 percent in fiscal 2006. The rate is then assumed to decrease 1 percent for 1 year, reaching 6 percent in fiscal 2007. These trend rates reflect management's expectations of future rates. Increasing the healthcare cost trend by 1 percent would increase the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by $1.1 million and service and interest cost by $0.4 million. Decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1 percent would decrease the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by $1.0 million and the service and interest cost by $0.3 million.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, " which amends SFAS 87 and SFAS 106.
"Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
The Company participates in a defined contribution plan, which covers substantially all of its employees and Visa International employees residing in the United States. Personnel costs included $24.1 million, $22.9 million, and $26.1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for expenses attributable to the Company's employees under the plan. The Company's contributions to this plan are funded on a current basis and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred.
During fiscal 2004, the Company made amendments to its defined contribution plan. The Company reduced employer contributions while increasing the maximum covered pay-percentage of employee contributions. The Company eliminated the minimum service requirement for participation in the plan and accelerated the vesting period. Finally, the Company eliminated the credited service requirement for rehires. The impact of these changes is expected to reduce personnel costs in future periods.
The Company has employee incentive plans under which cash awards may be made annually based on performance results. Personnel costs included $106.1 million, $93.5 million, and $94.1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for expenses attributable to the incentive plans.
 
 
Note 14Debt
The Company held debt as follows:
 
In December 2002, the Company issued $200 million in Senior Secured Notes with maturity dates of five and ten years. The notes are collateralized by the Company's Colorado facility, which consists of two data centers and an office building, in addition to processing assets and developed software. These assets are included in Facilities, Equipment, and Software, Net and have net carrying values of $147.7 million and $172.8 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2006 and 2005.
In May 2004, the Company executed the First Amendment and Waiver to the Note Purchase Agreement (First Amendment) associated with these Senior Secured Notes. Under terms of the amendment, interest rates increased and a letter of credit was added to existing collateral. Interest rates increased from 4.64 to 5.39 percent on Series A Notes and from 5.60 to 6.35 percent on Series B Notes.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, certain financial covenant requirements under the First Amendment were met. As a result, as of April 1, 2006 the interest rates on these Notes decreased from 5.39 percent to 4.64 percent on Series A Notes and from 6.35 percent to 5.60 percent on Series B Notes. In addition, the Company is no longer obligated to retain a letter of credit required under the First Amendment (Note 12). Certain other financial covenant requirements associated with net income, liquidity, and sales are also no longer required. At September 30, 2006, the company was in compliance with financial covenants included in the original notes including maintenance of minimum total accumulated net revenues of $300 million and certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.
Annual maturities on debt are as follows:
 
The fair value of the Company's debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 was $73.7 million and $107.9
 
 
million, respectively, which differs from the carrying amounts of $75.5 million and $108.7 million, respectively, included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note 15Investment Income, Net
Investment Income, Net is comprised of the following:
 
Note 16Income Taxes
The Company's income tax expense consisted of the following:
 
 
 
The Company's net deferred tax asset was related to the following temporary differences:
 
The Company purchased the stock of Inovant, Inc. on January 1, 2003. The fiscal 2006 and 2005 deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the addition of deferred tax assets and liabilities from Inovant, Inc. A valuation allowance had previously been established for the state research and development credit carry-forwards acquired as part of the Inovant, Inc. transaction since the Company believed it more likely than not that those credits would not be realized. Based upon audit results related to research and development at the Federal level which impacted these credits, a corresponding adjustment has been made to the deferred tax asset and the associated valuation allowance on these underlying credits as of September 30, 2005. In fiscal 2006, it was determined that it was not probable that the position that gave rise to the deferred tax asset relating to a state filing methodology would be sustainable. Accordingly, both the underlying deferred tax assets and the accompanying valuation allowance were reversed.
In fiscal 2005, the Company conducted a series of vendor audits and recorded adjustments to current and prior years. As a result of these vendor adjustments, a deferred tax liability of $2.3 million was recorded related to prior years.
In fiscal 2006, the Company performed a historical analysis of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result of this analysis, adjustments were made to deferred tax assets and liabilities. The net effect of the adjustments is approximately $3.3 million, which is primarily attributable to fixed asset adjustments related to years prior to fiscal 2002.
 
 
The Company's gross deferred tax asset is appropriately stated at a level which the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized in the future, primarily from the generation of future taxable income based on levels of past taxable income.
Income tax expense (benefit) on net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and was $1.5 million, ($3.2) million, and ($0.1) million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
The Company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to its investment in Visa International in fiscal 2005. A deferred tax liability was recorded related to the cumulative adjustment of approximately $54.1 million (Note 3).
The income tax expense differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following differences:
 
Income taxes payable of $7.9 million and $42.9 million are included in Accrued Liabilities as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income taxes receivable of $5.6 million and $2.3 million are included in Prepaid and Other Current Assets as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The difference in the state tax rate between fiscal 2006 and 2005 results primarily from partial results of a California examination relating to the proper application of a previously issued ruling from the state.
 
 
Note 17Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Leases
The Company leases certain premises and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. Total rent expense, excluding rent paid to Visa Resources (Note 8), incurred by the Company was $30.7 million, $32.5 million, and $43.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum commitments on remaining operating leases with original terms of more than one year are as follows:
 
The Company leases a data center in which at the expiration of the lease, the Company will incur certain restoration costs such as the costs to remove leasehold improvements. The carrying amount of this asset retirement obligation was $0.0 million and $3.2 million as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company recorded a charge of $0.1 million in accretion expense in fiscal 2006.
In March 2003, the Company approved a data center strategy that included a plan to decommission one of its data centers by January 2007. In September 2006, the Company executed a lease termination agreement for the data center facility. The lease termination agreement provides for an expected lease termination date in January 2007 and revised the Company's restoration obligations under the lease. In addition, there is a one-time lease termination payment of $5.0 million due to the landlord. The exit costs of $5.0 million were recorded in Administrative and Other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2006.
Capital Leases
The Company entered into capital leases for certain computer equipment during 2005. The Company is financing the acquisition of the underlying assets through the leases, and accordingly they are recorded in the Company's assets and liabilities. Amortization charges for related assets are included in Network, EDP, and Communications in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future minimum payments under capital leases are as follows:
 
 
 
Volume and Support Agreements
The Company has agreements with members and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from three to ten years, provide card issuance, marketing, and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage member loyalty and to increase overall Visa-branded payment volume, thereby reducing unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa members.
The Company is currently a party to other long-term contractual arrangements ranging from two to eight years. These contracts are designed to help the Company increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, the Company is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights.
Payments made and obligations incurred under these contracts are included in Volume and Support Agreements, on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's obligation under these contracts is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of benefit. Amortization is recorded in Volume and Support Agreements and in Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The expected reduction of future earnings resulting from these agreements is estimated as follows:
 
In connection with these contractual commitments, the Company has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. The Company's maximum advertising and marketing commitment through June 2013 is $189.4 million.
Settlement Indemnification
Under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws, the Company indemnifies issuing and acquiring members for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other member to honor drafts, travelers checks, or other instruments processed in accordance with the Operating Regulations. Visa International is the Company's settlement agent. Under the Visa International bylaws, the Company partially indemnifies Visa International from losses due to the failure of a member. The term and the amount of the indemnity are not limited. The Company is responsible for losses up to $1.0 million plus .003 percent of the Company's sales volume for the year preceding the loss, or approximately $36.7 million in fiscal 2006. Excess worldwide losses are allocated among Visa entities based on their proportionate share of total sales volume.
 
 
The Company provides data processing services for deposit access products, including comprehensive support for the following payment products: the Visa Check card, Visa Buxx, and the Interlink network. The Company also supports point-of sale check service drivers at over 1,000 ATMs and provides gateway access to all major U.S. payment networks.
The Company is subject to settlement risk for credit and debit transactions due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. The Company has global risk management policies and procedures that include risk standards to provide a framework for managing the Company's settlement exposure. To reduce the risk of settlement exposure, the Company obtains collateral from members, as needed, to ensure a member's performance of its settlement obligations.
As of September 30, 2006, management estimated its liability under credit and debit indemnification obligations by multiplying third-party estimates of the probability of bank failure by member average daily volumes and estimated average number of days to settle. The resulting probability-weighted value of the guarantee, after consideration of collateral held and estimated losses in the event of bank failure, was $0.3 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. This amount is reflected in Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In the event that the Company makes a payment under this guarantee on behalf of a failed member as to which insufficient collateral is available to the Company and the Company borrows to cover settlement payment, member fees may be increased to account for the settlement loss, subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The Company may receive reimbursement from Visa International for such settlement losses above a certain deductible amount pursuant to Visa International bylaws, as discussed above.
Member Advance Deposit Program
In September 2003, the Company introduced a Member Advance Deposit Program whereby members could choose to advance a deposit against their quarterly member service fees. As an incentive for member participation, the amount of the deposit was discounted at 6 percent. Any principal member of Visa U.S.A. could elect to participate in the Advance Deposit Program. All advance deposits under the program, totaling $536.4 million, were received by October 2003. One-sixteenth of the member's total undiscounted deposit amount is applied as a credit against the next sixteen quarterly operating certificate fees otherwise payable to the Company, commencing with the first quarterly operating certificate filed subsequent to receipt of the member's initial deposit. As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, the balance of Member Deposits were $137.4 million and $271.5 million, respectively. Application of remaining Member Deposits to quarterly operating certificate fees payable will continue through December 2007.
Indemnification of Visa International
In conjunction with the Inovant, Inc. purchase on January 1, 2003 between Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, the Company agreed to indemnify Visa International in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a Taxing Authority resulting from the sale of stock of Inovant, Inc. The indemnification is effective for ten years and extends through thirty years or statute of limitations in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase. Maximum potential future payments under the guarantee are difficult to assess due to the inability to predict future adverse tax determinations by a Taxing Authority and the absence of exposure limits. Management has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote, based on current known facts. Consequently, the maximum probability-weighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued.
 
 
Indemnification of Real Estate Joint Ventures
In August 2004, Visa U.S.A. agreed with VLD I and VLD II that Visa U.S.A. would assume financial responsibility for any prepayment penalty incurred by VLD I and VLD II in the event that Note Purchase Agreements of these organizations are called because of actions that are the sole responsibility of Visa U.S.A. Management has assessed the probability of making payment on the guarantee as remote, based on current known facts, and as such, no liability has been recorded. The maximum estimated pre-payment penalty in the event that the Note Purchase Agreements are paid before maturity is $3.0 million.
Holographic Magnetic Card Reimbursement
In January 2006, the Company introduced a new card design with holographic magnetic stripe technology as part of its global brand architecture initiative. Limited technical problems were noted with regard to the use of the card and therefore the Company advised its members to discontinue its manufacture and distribution. The Company is a committed partner to its members and has established a reimbursement process for members and card vendors that have incurred production and issuance costs. As of September 30, 2006, the Company has an accrual of $23.0 million in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This obligation is an estimate of the amount required to reimburse the Company's members for certain costs they have incurred with regard to the manufacture and distribution of the holographic magnetic card design. This amount may be adjusted as required when members complete their analyses of costs incurred. Members have until December 31, 2006 to file their claims. As of September 30, 2006, $4.9 million in claims have been filed by members and $1.2 million of claims have been paid.
Contingent Gain
On June 30, 2005, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 625,000 shares in WildCard Systems, Inc. (WildCard). Visa's shares represent approximately 3 percent of shares outstanding. In July 2005, the Company sold its shares to eFunds Corporation (eFunds) as part of eFunds' cash acquisition of WildCard. The sale resulted in no gain to the Company. However, as provided for in the acquisition, an "earn out" of up to $59.0 million could be paid if the acquired business achieved certain revenue targets in calendar year 2006. Visa's share in this contingent "earn out" was estimated to be a maximum of $1.9 million. There was no guarantee that these revenue targets would be met, and as such, the gain contingency was not reflected in the Company's financial statements. In April 2007, the Company concluded that there would be no earn out realized.
Note 18Legal Matters
Visa is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves related to these proceedings as at this time in the proceedings the matter does not relate to a probable loss and/or amounts are not estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
The Company's Litigation Provision includes provisions of $22.9 million, $132.3 million, and $36.9 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The fiscal 2006 provision is net of an $11.5 million insurance recovery received in fiscal 2006. There was no insurance recovery in 2005 or 2004. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice
 
 
of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet dates. The Company is presently involved in the matters described below and other legal actions. The Company will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future refinements to the accrual will be made.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the litigation in fiscal 2006 and 2005:
 
Rule 2.10(e) Litigation
American Express/Discover
On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. (Discover) filed an action against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard) in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 15, 2004, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (American Express) filed a similar action in the same court against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and certain of their member financial institutions. Both complaints seek treble damages and injunctive relief under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, asserting that Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's Competitive Programs Policy (CPP) prevented banks from issuing payment cards on the American Express and Discover networks. Discover also contends that Visa's "Honor All Cards" rule reinforced the anticompetitive effects of bylaw 2.10(e).
Both lawsuits have been assigned to the district court judge who presided in v. (the DOJ Case), in which the Department of Justice challenged bylaw 2.10(e) and the CPP. In the DOJ Case, the court in 2001 enjoined Visa and MasterCard from enacting, enforcing, or maintaining any bylaw, rule, policy, or practice that prohibits members from issuing general purpose or debit cards on any other general purpose card network. In accordance with this court order, Visa U.S.A. repealed bylaw 2.10(e). The court has deferred ruling on whether, or to what extent, it will give effect in the and cases to factual findings made in the DOJ case.

American Express
Discover
The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the and cases. In the fall of 2005, the court granted MasterCard and Visa International's motions to dismiss Discover's attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against them, because Discover did not allege that either MasterCard or Visa International individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims. The court denied Visa U.S.A.'s analogous motion, however, finding that Discover had alleged sufficient market share as to Visa U.S.A. The court also denied Visa and MasterCard's motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' debit card claims, ruling that the plaintiffs had properly alleged a debit card market. Visa's motion to dismiss American Express's exclusive-dealing claim was also denied.
American Express
Discover
Fact discovery is scheduled to be completed by May 31, 2007. The majority of documents have been exchanged and depositions are underway. No trial date has been set.
 
 
Attridge
On December 8, 2004, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and MasterCard in California state court (). The complaint asserted claims under California's Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law, based in part on Visa's former bylaw 2.10(e). The Cartwright Act claim, however, was dismissed in May 2006. On October 4, 2006, the court approved a plan for initial discovery, which is now proceeding. No trial date has been set.
Attridge
Interchange Litigation
Kendall
In October 2004, a class action was filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, and several banks (). The Kendall class purported to represent all merchants that accept Visa- or MasterCard-branded payment cards, and alleged, among other things, that the setting of interchange is unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In addition to money damages, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin Visa and MasterCard from setting interchange rates and from allegedly negotiating merchant discount rates with certain merchants. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in April 2005 and stipulated that the suit related only to conduct taking place after January 1, 2004.
Kendall
On July 25, 2005, the court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 10, 2005. Both sides have fully briefed the appeal, but no date has been set for oral argument.
Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings
In fiscal 2005 and 2006, approximately fifty lawsuitsmost of which were asserted as purported class actionswere filed on behalf of merchants who accept payment cards against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, and other defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws by setting interchange rates (among other claims, as described below). The suits seek treble damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees, as well as injunctive and other relief.
On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order establishing a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) in the Eastern District of New York. The Honorable John H. Gleeson was assigned to coordinate pretrial proceedings in the cases transferred to the MDL. On April 24, 2006, a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed, which supersedes the class action complaints filed previously. One additional class action was filed after the date of the consolidated class complaint; it has been conditionally transferred to MDL 1720 but has not yet been made part of the consolidated class. Visa U.S.A. is a defendant in the consolidated class action complaint and nine additional complaints filed on behalf of individual plaintiffs.
The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the setting of interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act; that Visa's "no surcharge" rule and other alleged Visa rules violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act; and that the rules and interchange together constitute monopolization, violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. The consolidated class action complaint further asserts that Visa ties "Payment Guarantee Services" and "Network Processing Services" to "Payment Card System Services" and engages in exclusive dealing, both in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and that offline debit interchange violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act.
 
 
The individual complaints include similar claims and also allege that Visa impermissibly ties services for "Premium Credit Cards" to services for other Visa-branded payment cards.
On June 9, 2006, Visa answered the consolidated class action complaint and moved to dismiss in part, or strike, claims for pre- January 1, 2004 damages. The parties are currently engaged in document production, written discovery, and non-substantive depositions. No trial date has been set.
Retailers' Litigation
Retailers' Litigation
In 1996, a merchant class action was filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that Visa's "Honor All Cards" rule and MasterCard's analogous rule violated federal antitrust laws . On June 4, 2003, a settlement agreement was executed. Visa agreed to modify its "Honor All Cards" rule such that, effective January 1, 2004, a merchant may accept only Visa check cards, only Visa credit cards, or both. Visa also agreed to pay approximately $2.0 billion to the merchant class over ten years, among other things. The court approved the settlement on December 19, 2003.
(In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation, or Retailers')
Several objectors appealed the district court's approval of the settlement agreement. In January 2005, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling. The Court of Appeals held that the settlement releases all claims that were or could have been asserted by the class through December 31, 2003, including claims challenging interchange and bylaw 2.10(e). As such, other pending cases challenging interchange and bylaw 2.10(e) were released by the settlement. A petition for rehearing was denied on March 1, 2005, as was a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Settlement funds are now being distributed to the class.
Plaintiffs in one action challenging interchange (, filed in 2002) appealed the Northern District of California's dismissal of its case based on the release in the Retailers' settlement agreement. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard argument on December 7, 2005 and affirmed the district court's dismissal on March 27, 2006.
Reyn's Pasta Bella
In January 2006, the United States made a monetary claim against the settlement fund that was established in connection with the settlement of the in December 2003. The United States was not a class member, but asserted equitable arguments as a "merchant" on behalf of its agencies and instrumentalities accepting Visa or MasterCard cards. After the claims administrator denied the government's claim, the government appealed the decision to the federal court that has retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes relating to administration of the settlement fund. On December 29, 2006, a settlement agreement was reached whereby Visa and MasterCard International Incorporated together will pay the U.S. government $3.5 million and the government's claim against the settlement fund will be capped and reduced by 66 percent. Visa's portion of the agreement is $2.0 million. The settlement also provides Visa with a full release from the U.S. government for all interchange and "Honor All Cards"-type claims accruing prior to January 1, 2004. The District Court entered an order approving the settlement on February 28, 2007.

Retailers' "Opt-Outs"
Several merchants who "opted-out" of the Retailers' class action asserted similar claims against Visa U.S.A. These cases were consolidated for pretrial proceedings (MDL 1575) before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Visa U.S.A. has settled all but one of these suits, and, as a result, recorded a
 
 
pre-tax charge of $19.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2005. Discovery has begun in the sole remaining "opt-out" matter (). In , the plaintiff contends that it can pursue a motion for partial summary judgment previously filed by the settling "opt-out" merchants. The motion has been briefed but no hearing has been scheduled.

Retailers' "Conspiracy" Cases
In the summer of 2005, purported consumer class actions were filed against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Bennett) and Circuit City Stores, Inc. (Temple) in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. In these cases, the plaintiffs allege that Wal-Mart and Circuit City, respectively, engaged in tying, attempted monopolization, and other conduct in violation of the Tennessee Trade Practices Act and the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act. They also assert various common law claims. Visa and MasterCard are not named as defendants in these actions, but are alleged to have conspired with Wal-Mart and Circuit City. Wal-Mart and Circuit City have sought to have the cases transferred to the Eastern District of New York. The magistrate has recommended that the cases be transferred, and the plaintiffs have filed objections to that recommendation.
"Indirect Purchaser" Actions
Forty so-called "indirect purchaser" actions stemming from the Retailers' litigation have been filed against Visa and MasterCard in nineteen states and the District of Columbia. In these actions, the plaintiffs purport to represent classes of residents of one or more states who purchased goods at merchants that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded payment cards. They claim to have paid higher prices as a result of the purported "tying" and other alleged anti-competitive conduct at issue in the Retailers' litigation. The plaintiffs assert claims under state antitrust statutes, state consumer protection statutes, and common law.
Cases in ten jurisdictions were dismissed by the trial court and the plaintiffs declined to pursue an appeal. The actions in New York, Tennessee, and Nebraska ended after the trial courts' dismissals with prejudice were affirmed on appeal. The action in Iowa was dismissed by the trial court in a decision that is currently under appeal. Lawsuits in California and West Virginia have not been dismissed but may not proceed into discovery. Actions in the four other jurisdictions remain before trial courts pending resolution of existing or anticipated motions to dismiss.
In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recorded charges related to the Retailers' settlement and other merchant litigation matters of $79.6 million, $117.8 million, and $102.1 million, respectively, which are reflected in Litigation Provision and Interest Expense on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The primary component of fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 charges was accretion expense of $79.6 million, $98.0 million, and $99.5 million, respectively, recorded on the Retailers' settlement and other merchant litigation matters, discounted at 7.25 percent over the payment terms. Relating to these matters, cash payments of $211 million, $268 million, and $205 million were made in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Settlement Service Fee Litigation
On September 23, 2003, MasterCard filed papers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Visa U.S.A.'s bylaw 3.14, the Settlement Service Fee (SSF), does not comply with the terms of the injunction issued in the DOJ Case. In December 2003, the court denied MasterCard's motion on jurisdictional grounds. MasterCard re-filed its challenge to the SSF on January 10, 2005, seeking repeal of bylaw 3.14 and a court order giving certain Visa debit issuers the right to rescind all or part of Visa debit Partnership agreements entered into since the SSF was enacted. A court appointed Special Master conducted an evidentiary hearing in December 2005.
 
 
On July 7, 2006, the Special Master submitted confidential findings of fact and conclusions of law to the court. Visa and MasterCard have filed objections and alternative motions to adopt or modify the Report under seal in July and August 2006. The court may adopt, modify, or reject the Special Master's recommendation, or resubmit the case to the Special Master for further proceedings. No timeframe for a ruling by the court has been set and any final order may be appealed.
Currency Conversion Litigation
State Litigation
In 2000, a "representative" action was filed in California state court against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in connection with Visa's practice of charging its members a 1 percent "currency conversion fee" when a U.S. cardholder purchases goods or services in a foreign currency, and the disclosure of that fee (). Plaintiffs claimed Visa's currency conversion practices violated California Business & Professions Code Section 17200, and sought injunctive relief and restitution.
Schwartz
Four additional California state currency conversion class actions were filed against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International. Shrieve and Castro alleged that Visa had a duty to inform cardholders using debit cards overseas of the existence of the 1 percent currency conversion fee that Visa charges its members. Mattingly alleged Visa had a duty to inform cardholders using credit cards overseas of the existence of the 1 percent currency conversion fee. Baker challenged Visa International's calculation of currency conversion rates and the disclosure of those rates. All plaintiffs sought restitution and injunctive relief.
Federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
A federal MDL currency conversion lawsuit alleged, , price-fixing violations against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and a number of banks arising out of the 1 percent currency conversion fee Visa charges to members and the optional issuer fees that issuers may charge cardholders. In March 2005, the court held that plaintiffs with valid arbitration agreements cannot go forward in court and must proceed with arbitration instead. Those plaintiffs are appealing the ruling.
inter alia

First Data Litigation
In April 2002, Visa U.S.A. filed a complaint against First Data Corporation, First Data Resources, Inc., and First Data Merchant Services Corporation (collectively, First Data) in United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The action was based on First Data's attempt to implement, without Visa's prior approval, a "private arrangement" among Visa members by which First Data would authorize, clear, and settle Visa transactions, bypassing VisaNet. Visa asserted trademark and related contract claims and sought declaratory
 
 
relief, injunctive relief, and damages. First Data filed counterclaims in November 2002, alleging that Visa violated federal and state antitrust laws by banning private arrangements. First Data also asserted common law contract and tort claims and a claim under California state consumer protection law. In August 2004, First Data filed amended counterclaims, adding a "concerted refusal to deal" claim under federal antitrust laws and expanding the market definition to include "debit card network processing services."

Note 20Subsequent Events
Proposed Restructuring
In October 2006, Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and Visa Canada announced their intention to restructure Visa in order to create a new global corporation called Visa Inc. The restructuring and related activities are subject to approval by Visa members and regulatory authorities. It is anticipated that Visa Inc. will be created
 
 
through a series of mergers involving Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and Visa Canada. Visa Europe will remain a membership association, owned and governed by its European member banks, and become a licensee of Visa Inc. Visa Europe will have a minority ownership interest in Visa Inc. The reorganization will result in a new stock corporation owned by former members of Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and Visa Canada. As a part of the restructuring, the board of Visa Inc. will be comprised of a majority of independent directors.
Appointment of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Directors of Visa Inc.
On February 12, 2007, Joseph W. Saunders was named the designated Executive Chairman of the board of Directors of Visa Inc. and, on May 15, 2007, the designated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. Before the formation of Visa Inc., Mr. Saunders began fulfilling the responsibilities of these positions as a designated appointee of Visa Inc. and officially assumed the title of Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer upon the formation of Visa Inc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1Organization
Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A. or the Company) consists of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and its subsidiaries: Inovant, Inc., International Anasazi, Inc., Interlink Network, Inc., Integrated Solutions Concepts, Inc., Debit Processing Services, Inc., Plus System, Inc., Inovant LLC, and Advanced Resolution Services, Inc.
In June 2006, the Company dissolved its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Processing Holdings, Inc. (MPH). MPH held the Company's joint venture interest in Vital Processing Services LLC, which was sold in March 2005.
The Company has one operating and reportable segment, "Payment Services" in the United States. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa U.S.A. as one operating and reporting segment.
Visa U.S.A. is a non-stock, non-assessable, Delaware corporation. The Company operates a payment system that enables consumers and businesses to conduct financial transactions using Visa-branded payment products at physical and virtual points-of-sale and at automated teller machines which are identified by the Visa Brand Mark, Visa Point-of-Sale Graphic or familiar three-band Visa Flag, and other various designs and marks in the United States.
Visa's products and services enable its members to participate in an international payment system that none could offer individually. Visa U.S.A. does not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on Visa-branded cards. Visa U.S.A.'s issuing members have the independent responsibility individually to determine these and most other competitive card features. These functions are performed by Visa U.S.A. member financial institutions in competition with one another. Visa U.S.A. establishes standards and procedures for acceptance and settlement of member transactions. Visa's services allow merchants and consumers to use efficient, secure, and guaranteed payment products in lieu of cash, checks, and other forms of payment. Its relationship is with the cardholder's issuing and merchant's acquiring member financial institutions.
Membership is composed of financial institutions participating in this system. At its April 2006 Annual Meeting, the Company adopted an amended Certificate of Incorporation and amended bylaws which changed the composition of the Board of Directors and clarified dividend, dissolution, membership interest, and voting rights. In accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, members pay service fees each quarter based on payments volume for the preceding quarter. Payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with Visa products, including PIN-based debit, and excluding cash disbursements obtained from Visa-branded card balance transfers and convenience checks. Members' dividend and dissolution rights, membership interests in the corporation, and voting rights are based on the members' respective cumulative portions of the total of all of certain fees paid to the Company up to the most recent Reference Date as defined in the amended Certificate of Incorporation. The initial Reference Date is May 1, 2006 and members' proportions will be adjusted as of each third anniversary of that date. The Board of Directors includes independent Directors who meet eligibility requirements set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, including the definition of independence from the Company and its members. The chief executive officers of the Company and of Visa International Service Association (Visa International) serve as non-voting directors. Directors other than directors are elected in at-large voting by members in accordance with voting rights and director qualifications set forth in the Company's bylaws. Under the amended Certificate of Incorporation, the directors will serve staggered terms of two years. Members represented on the Board of Directors accounted for 38 percent of total card payments volume for the twelve months ended March 31, 2007. Visa U.S.A. members, which are comprised of domestic banks and other financial institutions, represent 100 percent of the Company's payments volume.

As described in Note 20 to the Company's 2006 audited financial statements, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan in October 2006 to form Visa Inc. by a series of mergers involving Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada Association (Visa Canada), and Visa International. On June 15, 2007, the boards of directors of Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe) approved the global restructuring agreement that contemplates a series of transactions by which Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada and Inovant will become subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Under the terms of this agreement, Visa Europe will not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc.; it will instead become a stockholder of Visa Inc. and will enter into a series of contractual relationships that will govern its relationship with Visa Inc. The restructuring and related activities are subject to member approval and review by regulatory authorities.
In February 2007, Visa International hired Joseph W. Saunders as the designated Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Visa Inc. On May 15, 2007, Mr. Saunders was designated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. and officially began serving in this capacity upon the formation of Visa Inc. in May 2007.
In June 2007 the Visa U.S.A. board of directors appointed John Partridge as interim President of Visa U.S.A. This appointment followed the resignation of John Phillip Coghlan as President and Chief Executive Officer of Visa U.S.A.
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements as of the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are unaudited and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been omitted, and accordingly these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2006.
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods presented.
Revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of results for any other interim period or for the entire year.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa U.S.A. and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company consolidates entities when it has a greater than 50 percent ownership or when it exercises control. Minority interest is recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company has less than 100 percent ownership interest. Minority interest represents the equity interest in Inovant LLC which is not owned by the Company.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications, not affecting net income, have been made to prior period information to conform to the current period presentation format.
 
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include certain revenue discounts and volume-based support incentives, assumptions used in the determination of pension and postretirement costs, discount rates used to calculate the present value of long-term obligations, and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among others.
Advertising Costs
In accordance with SOP 93-7, "the Company expenses the production costs of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Total advertising costs, included in Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $242 million and $262 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Reporting on Advertising Costs,"
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Positions Nos. 115-1 and 124-1, "" (FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1). FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 address the determination of when an investment is considered impaired and whether impairment is temporary. These pronouncements provide a three-step process for determining and accounting for other-than-temporary impairment, as well as disclosure requirements for reporting unrealized losses. FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 are effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FSP SFAS 115 and SFAS 124-1 on October 1, 2005. Additional disclosures required under the pronouncements are included in Note 5. The adoption of FSP SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 did not have an impact to the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
Note 3Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe
Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe are all separately incorporated entities. The Company pays expenses to Visa International and earns revenues from Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe.
A summary of the major expenses paid to Visa International is as follows:
 
Visa U.S.A. operates a proprietary network, VisaNet, that links issuers and acquirers for transaction processing services. Processing services are provided through the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, Inovant LLC. The Company provides processing and development services and various license and usage rights to Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe, in accordance with service agreements with these entities.
 
 
A summary of Data Processing Fees and Other Revenues received from Visa International, Visa Canada, and Visa Europe is as follows:
 
The net balances for related party services due to or from the Company, presented below, are recorded in Accounts Receivable, Prepaid and Other Current Assets, and Accrued Liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
As of June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company also had receivables of $20.0 million from Visa International related to income taxes. This balance is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company has an uncommitted credit facility with Visa International whereby the Company or Visa International may provide each other short-term financing with a maximum term of five business days. Neither the Company nor Visa International has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company. There were no outstanding balances as of June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 under this arrangement.
Note 4Prepaid and Other Current Assets
Prepaid and Other Current Assets is comprised of the following:
 
 
 
Note 5Investments
Available-for-sale investment securities, which are recorded at fair value, consist of marketable debt securities issued by government-sponsored entities, tax-exempt municipal bonds, auction rate securities, and mutual fund investments in equity securities. The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of available-for-sale securities are as follows:
 
The contractual maturity of available-for-sale debt securities regardless of their balance sheet classification is as follows:
 
Investments with a fair market value less than cost at June 30, 2007 are as follows:
 
 
 
The unrealized losses on investments in government-sponsored entities and tax-exempt municipal bonds are caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of the initial issuance of the securities. As of June 30, 2007, a total of 101 investments in government-sponsored entities and tax-exempt municipal bonds are in an unrealized loss position. Because management has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be to maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2007.
Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by reductions in personnel expense. Unrealized losses on equity securities were caused by changes in market conditions. As of June 30, 2007, a total of 8 fund investments are in an unrealized loss position. The Company has not identified any events or changes in circumstances that may have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of investments in equity securities. Based on an evaluation of the near-term prospects of these investments and management's ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2007.
Note 6Intangible Assets
In 2003, the Company entered into an exclusive ten-year licensing agreement with a member. The agreement granted Visa U.S.A. patent and know-how rights, which allowed the Company to market and distribute Mini Cards within the United States. The license granted is sub-licensable.
In June 2006, the Company assessed a low probability of future incremental cash flows from the Mini Card; given the Company's strategic focus on developing next-generation payment platforms and services, and minimal Mini Card issuance by Visa U.S.A. members. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $13.2 million in June 2006 for the net carrying value of the asset. The expense is reflected in Administrative and Other on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations during the nine months ended June 30, 2006. Related amortization, included in Administrative and Other, was $1.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2006.

Note 9Workforce Reduction
In an effort to manage personnel and contract staffing levels in alignment with seasonality and project demand, the Company initiated a formal Flexible Resource Management plan in November 2006 to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. The plan is expected to reduce the Company's workforce by approximately 200 employees, which represents approximately 6 percent of the Company's total workforce as of June 30, 2007. Costs associated with this workforce reduction plan are related to termination benefits and retention bonuses. As of June 30, 2007, costs associated with this plan are estimated to be $14.5 million and are projected to be incurred throughout 2007 and 2008.
Most terminations are expected to be completed by the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007 while retention bonuses will continue to be paid through the third fiscal quarter of 2008 for employees who have been requested to render services until that time.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 146, " the Company incurred charges of $12.7 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2007.
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,"
These costs are estimated based on the Company's workforce reduction plan as of the balance sheet date and are subject to adjustment. The Company continually evaluates the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under its workforce reduction plan. Although the Company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan, actual results may differ, thereby requiring the Company to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions.
Activity related to the workforce reduction is included in Personnel expense on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and in Accrued Compensation on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
 
 
 
Note 10Concentration of Business Risks

Operating revenues from these customers were as follows:
 
Note 11Commitments and Contingencies
Volume and Support Agreements
The Company has agreements with members and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from approximately one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing, and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage more member business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment volume, thereby reducing unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa U.S.A. members.
The Company is currently a party to other long-term contractual sponsorship arrangements ranging from approximately two to eight years. These contracts are designed to help the Company increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, the Company is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights.
Payments made and obligations incurred under these programs are included in Volume and Support Agreements and Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's obligation under member and merchant agreements is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of benefit and recorded in Volume and Support Agreements on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization for sponsorship agreements is recorded in Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Restricted LiabilitiesProgram Retirement
In April 2005, the Company introduced a program that supported card product usage for selected utilities that met certain acceptance standards. The program was funded by debit issuers at the time of settlement, to support efforts on their behalf to secure utility merchant acceptance and promote debit products usage. Under current program rules, unused funds were required to be returned to debit issuers at the conclusion of the program. The balance for this program was $3.5 million at June 30, 2007 and $2.3 million at September 30, 2006.
In January 2004, the Company introduced a program that supported Visa Check card usage and other business arrangements for selected merchants that met certain acceptance standards. The program was funded by Visa Check card issuers at the time of settlement, to support efforts on their behalf to secure merchant acceptance and promote card usage. Under current program rules, unused funds were required to be returned to Visa Check
 
 
card issuers at the conclusion of the program. The balance for this program was $91.2 million at June 30, 2007 and $74.5 million at September 30, 2006. These funds are included in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Investment Securities, and Accrued Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as appropriate.
In April 2007, the Company retired both of these programs. Under current program rules, remaining unused funds from these programs will be returned to issuers by September 30, 2007. The Volume and Support Agreements table below has been updated to include future commitments under agreements sponsored by these retired programs.
The expected reduction of future revenues resulting from Volume and Support Agreements, including acceptance agreements sponsored by the retired programs described above, is estimated as follows:
 
Holographic Magnetic Card Reimbursement
In January 2006, the Company introduced a new card design with holographic magnetic stripe technology as part of its global brand architecture initiative. Limited technical problems were noted with regard to the use of the card and therefore the Company advised its members to discontinue its manufacture and distribution. The Company is a committed partner to its members and has established a reimbursement process for members and card vendors that have incurred production and issuance costs. As of June 30, 2007, the Company has an accrual of $4.4 million in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This obligation is an estimate of the remaining amount required to reimburse the Company's members for certain costs they have incurred with regard to the manufacture and distribution of the holographic magnetic card design. Members had until December 31, 2006 to file their claims. This amount may be adjusted as required when the Company completes its review of the claims it has received. As of June 30, 2007, $14.5 million in valid claims were filed by members and $10.1 million of these claims have been paid.
Contingent Gain
On June 30, 2005, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 625,000 shares in WildCard Systems, Inc. (WildCard). Visa U.S.A.'s shares represented approximately 3 percent of WildCard's shares outstanding. In July 2005, the Company sold its shares to eFunds Corporation (eFunds) as part of eFunds' cash acquisition of WildCard. The sale resulted in no gain to the Company. However, as provided for in the acquisition, an "earn out" of up to $59.0 million could be paid if the acquired business achieved certain revenue targets in calendar year 2006. Visa U.S.A.'s share in this contingent "earn out" was estimated to be a maximum of $1.9 million.
 
 
There was no guarantee that these revenue targets would be met, and as such, the gain contingency was not reflected in the Company's financial statements. In April 2007, the Company concluded that there would be no earn out realized.
Visa Extras
Visa Extras is a points-based rewards program administered by Visa U.S.A. and offered by members to their cardholders, which enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. The Company administers the program for participating members and contracts with a vendor to perform the rewards fulfillment and other functions. During the transition of fulfillment services to a new vendor in fiscal 2007, conversion issues arose which resulted in limited accessibility to the Visa Extras platform for participating members and cardholders for more than one month. During the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the Company recorded a charge of $4.7 million to remunerate impacted members for certain costs. These amounts are included as reductions to Other Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company believes that these amounts accurately reflect the Company's exposure for such expenses as of the balance sheet date, but will continually monitor the adequacy of the liability.
Operating Leases
During the quarter ended June 30, 2007, the Company entered into an operating lease for computer equipment which is effective beginning June 30, 2007 and ends October 31, 2010. The total obligation over the term of the lease including equipment maintenance costs is $33.7 million. The future commitments on this lease for the remainder of fiscal year 2007 is $0.5 million and $9.1 million, $11.6 million, $11.6 million and $0.9 million for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively.
Note 12Legal Matters
The Company's Litigation Provision includes provisions of $14.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and $21.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2006. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet dates. The Company will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future refinements to the accrual will be made.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the litigation during the period ended June 30, 2007:
 
The Company is presently involved in the matters described below and those described in Note 18 to the Company's 2006 audited financial statements.
 
 
Rule 2.10(e) Litigation
American Express/Discover
At a hearing on April 25, 2007, the District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of September 9, 2008 for both the American Express and Discover cases. The court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery.
On June 7, 2007, Discover filed a Second Amended Complaint, which eliminated allegations related to the "Honor All Cards" rule, dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against MasterCard and Visa International to conform to the court's rulings on motions to dismiss, and made technical changes to names of the plaintiffs.
On July 24, 2007, American Express and Discover served expert reports seeking substantial damages.
Interchange Litigation
Kendall
The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the plaintiffs' appeal on June 11, 2007. No ruling has been issued.
Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) 1720
On July 10, 2007, pursuant to a joint request by the parties, the court entered an amended scheduling order extending the deadline for fact discovery to June 30, 2008, expert discovery to February 20, 2009, and the deadline for completion of all summary judgment and other pretrial motions to March 27, 2009.
Retailers' Litigation
U.S. Government Litigation
In January 2006, the United States made a monetary claim against the settlement fund that was established in connection with the settlement of the in December 2003. The United States was not a class member, but asserted equitable arguments as a "merchant" on behalf of its agencies and instrumentalities accepting Visa or MasterCard cards. After the claims administrator denied the government's claim, the government appealed the decision to the federal court that has retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes relating to administration of the settlement fund. On December 29, 2006, a settlement agreement was reached whereby Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard International Incorporated together will pay the U.S. government $3.5 million and the government's claim against the settlement fund will be capped and reduced by 66 percent. Visa U.S.A.'s portion of the agreement is $2.0 million. The settlement also provides Visa U.S.A. with a full release from the U.S. government for all interchange and "honor all cards"-type claims accruing prior to January 1, 2004. The District Court entered an order approving the settlement on February 28, 2007.
Retailers' Litigation
Retailers'
Retailers'
Retailers' "Opt-Outs"
On May 14, 2007, GMRI, Inc. sought to amend its complaint and consolidate the case with Multidistrict Litigation 1720. Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and several of their member banks named as defendants in Multidistrict Litigation 1720 opposed the plaintiff's motion. On June 1, 2007, the plaintiff withdrew its request.
On June 22, 2007, GMRI filed suit against Visa International and various member banks of Visa U.S.A. and/or Visa International in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota, alleging both the merchant opt-out claims at issue in GMRI's suit against Visa U.S.A. and a number of the claims set forth in the class complaint filed in Multidistrict Litigation 1720 relating to interchange and Visa rules.
 
 
"Indirect Purchaser" Actions
In the California cases, consolidated before the Superior Court for the State of California in the City and County of San Francisco, Visa U.S.A. filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings based upon California Proposition 64, which limits a plaintiff's standing to bring claims under California's Business and Professions Code 17200 et. seq. After oral argument, the court denied Visa U.S.A.'s motion on March 6, 2007. The California Court of Appeal rejected a petition seeking immediate review of that decision on June 7, 2007.
In West Virginia, an action was brought against Visa U.S.A. by West Virginia's attorney general as for West Virginia consumers. The court denied Visa U.S.A.'s motion for summary judgment. Visa U.S.A. answered the West Virginia complaint on February 14, 2006 and the parties began discovery. On April 10, 2007, the court issued a stay of discovery pending its ruling on an antitrust standing issue. On April 27, 2007, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims against Visa U.S.A. In connection with this agreement, the Company recorded a provision for the settlement.
parens patriae
On June 22, 2007, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the action against Visa U.S.A.
On June 29, 2007, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Visa U.S.A.'s motion to dismiss.
Other Litigation
Settlement Service Fee (SSF) Litigation
The court held a hearing on April 23, 2007 and considered MasterCard's request for an order repealing the SSF and giving certain issuers an opportunity to terminate their agreements early.
On June 7, 2007, the court issued an Opinion and Order holding that the Settlement Service Fee violated the final judgment in the Department of Justice litigation as of October 15, 2004. On June 15, 2007, the court issued an Amended Opinion and Order clarifying the remedy in the ruling. First, the court ordered Visa U.S.A. to repeal the Settlement Service Fee bylaw. Second, the court gave any Visa U.S.A. debit issuer subject to the Settlement Service Fee prior to its repeal who entered into an agreement that includes offline debit issuance with Visa U.S.A. on or after June 20, 2003 the right to terminate its agreement, provided that the issuer has entered into an agreement to issue MasterCard-branded debit cards and the issuer repays to Visa U.S.A. any unearned benefits or financial incentives under its Visa U.S.A. agreement.
On June 13, 2007, the parties entered into an agreement to toll the statute of limitations on certain potential claims MasterCard may have against Visa U.S.A. in connection with the Settlement Service Fee.
Pursuant to the court's order, the settlement service fee bylaw was rescinded as of the effective date of the order. On June 29, 2007, Visa U.S.A. filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and on July 2, 2007, sought a stay pending appeal as to the remainder of the court's remedy. On July 13, 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a scheduling order for the appeal, which was subsequently modified by agreement of the parties. Visa U.S.A.'s appellate brief must be filed August 27, 2007 and MasterCard's response by September 26, 2007. Oral argument will likely occur sometime after early November 2007.
On August 7, 2007, the district court denied Visa U.S.A.'s request for a stay of the contract termination portion of the remedy pending the appeal. On August 17, 2007, Discover Financial Services and DFS Services LLC moved the district court to intervene in the settlement service fee matter. Discover also sought to have the
 
 
district court modify its June 15, 2007 order (1) to extend the contract termination remedy to issuers entering into agreements with Discover; and (2) to void certain provisions of Visa U.S.A.'s debit agreements. Visa U.S.A. intends to oppose Discover's motion.
Currency Conversion Litigation
Federal Multidistrict Litigation & State Litigation
Notice of the settlement began in 2007. In view of concerns raised by putative class members, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York appointed a special master to work with the parties to review and amend, as appropriate, the plan for class notice and distribution of the settlement fund and to determine whether the proposed settlement agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable with respect to all class members. The special master submitted his report on or about July 10, 2007, and recommended that the plan for notice and distribution of the fund be modified. On August 13, 2007, the court issued an order approving the claims procedure recommended by the special master. Revised notices, claim forms, and a settlement schedule are to be submitted to the court by August 31, 2007. The court has set a conference for September 20, 2007 to discuss these submissions. On November 8, 2006, the court set a hearing on entry of Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal, or the final fairness hearing, for November 2, 2007 to review objections to the settlement. However, in light of the special master's report, it is anticipated that the final fairness hearing will be moved to a later date.
District of Columbia Civil Investigative Demand
On January 5, 2007, the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia issued a Civil Investigative Demand ("CID") to Visa U.S.A. Inc. seeking information regarding a potential violation of Section 28-4502 of the District of Columbia Antitrust Act. The D.C. Attorney General's office is coordinating parallel investigations by the Attorneys General of New York and Ohio. The CID seeks documents and narrative responses to several interrogatories and document requests, which focus on PIN debit. Visa U.S.A. continues to cooperate with the Attorneys General in connection with the CID.
The ATM Exchange Litigation
The parties have engaged in written discovery, party and third-party depositions, and expert discovery. On June 29, 2007, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International filed motions for summary judgment on liability and damages. Trial was tentatively scheduled for September 2007. On July 30, 2007, the court vacated the tentative September 2007 trial date. The court indicated that it would set another trial date, if necessary, in its forthcoming ruling on the motions for summary judgment.
Harding Litigation
The parties are currently engaged in settlement negotiations. The potential settlement amount is not considered material to the Company's financial statements.
Lampone Litigation
On May 4, 2007, the parties executed a confidential agreement to settle the case and dispose of all claims. The court will review the agreement before dismissing the class claims. The settlement amount is not considered material to the Company's financial statements.
On May 30, 2007, the court approved the parties' settlement agreement and dismissed the case in its entirety with prejudice.
 
 
Intellectual Property Litigation
Every Penny Counts, Inc."Keep the Change"
On January 30, 2007, Every Penny Counts, Inc. filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Middle District of Florida against Bank of America Corporation and Visa U.S.A. alleging patent infringement related to Bank of America's "Keep the Change" program. Bank of America has agreed to indemnify Visa U.S.A. in this litigation and has taken over the defense of the lawsuit. On April 23, 2007, Every Penny Counts, Inc. voluntarily dismissed its claims against Visa U.S.A.
Privasys
On June 20, 2007, Privasys, Inc. filed a compliant in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Visa International and Visa U.S.A. for patent infringement. Privasys alleges that Visa U.S.A.'s contactless payment technology infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,195,154, entitled "Method for Generating Customer Secure Card Numbers." At this early stage it is not possible to make any reasonable evaluation of the claims alleged.
Every Penny Counts, Inc."Open Prepaid Cards"
On July 17, 2007, Every Penny Counts, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Visa U.S.A., MasterCard and American Express for patent infringement. The suit alleges that the defendants' "open" prepaid card products infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,876,971 ("Funds Distribution System Connected with Point of Sale Transaction"), U.S. Patent No. 5,621,640 ("Automatic Philanthropic Contribution System"), U.S. Patent No. 6,088,682 ("Funds Distribution System Connected with Point of Sale Transactions"), and U.S. Patent No. 6,112,191 ("Method and System to Create and Distribute Excess Funds from Consumer Spending Transactions"). At this early stage, it is not possible to make any reasonable evaluation of the claims alleged.
Note 13Subsequent Events
Change in Visa Retirement Plan
In August 2007, the Company approved changes to the Visa Retirement Plan and will begin transitioning from a defined benefit driven plan to cash balance benefits driven plan effective January 1, 2008. The change to a cash balance benefit formula will take effect immediately for employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2007. However, for employees hired before January 1, 2008 (and not rehired thereafter), the current Retirement Plan benefit formula will be grandfathered for a three year period and grandfathered employees will continue to accrue benefits under their current Visa Retirement Plan benefit formula and their accrued benefits as of December 31, 2010 (the last day of the grandfather period), or the date they terminate employment, if earlier, will be preserved. After that date, employees will not accrue any additional benefits under the current Visa Retirement Plan benefit formulas and all future benefit accruals will be under the cash balance benefit formula.
The above Visa Retirement Plan change affects the estimated impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." With respect to the Company's portion of the pension and postretirement plans at September 30, 2007, the after tax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 is expected to reduce member's equity by approximately $13 million.
 
To the Board of Directors of Visa Canada Association
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Visa Canada Association as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Canada Association as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006 in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles vary in certain significant respects from United States generally accepted accounting principles. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Visa Canada Association (the "Association") is a corporation without share capital whose members are Canadian financial institutions. It was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on September 22, 1989 and commenced active operations effective November 1, 1989. The Association is a not-for-profit organization exempt from income taxes under Section 149(1)(l) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), provided certain requirements are met.
The Association administers a payment system, including various card products and travellers' cheques, which are identified by the various Visa brand marks. The Association does not itself issue cards or acquire transactions for payments to merchants. These functions are performed by Visa member financial institutions in competition with one another. In turn, Visa International, of which the Association is a group member, provides certain payment system services to the Association. Members' voting rights are based on volume; however, no dividend or distribution rights accrue to the members.
Certain of Visa Canada's Member financial institutions have representation on Visa Canada's Board of Directors.
In October 2006, Visa Canada Association, Visa International and other separately incorporated regional group members (together, "Visa") announced the intention to restructure Visa in order to create a new global corporation called Visa Inc. The restructuring and related activities are subject to approval by Visa members and review by regulatory authorities. It is anticipated that Visa Inc. will be created through a series of mergers involving Visa Canada Association, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International. Visa Europe will remain a membership association, owned and governed by its European member banks, and become a licensee of Visa Inc. Visa Europe will have a minority ownership interest in Visa Inc. The reorganization will result in a new stock corporation owned by former members of Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Visa Canada. As a part of the restructuring, the board of Visa Inc. will be comprised of a majority of independent directors.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for not-for-profit organizations. The significant accounting policies are as follows:
(a) Basis of presentation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Association's wholly owned subsidiary, VCA Inovant Investments Inc. ("VCAIII"). The subsidiary is incorporated in the United States under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to hold its interest in Inovant LLC. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
VCAIII is a taxable entity in the United States and the tax amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements relate to United States corporate income taxes paid by VCAIII.
(b) Revenue recognition:
Revenue from fees charged to members (i.e., service fees, data processing fees and card recovery bulletin fees) is recognized when the services are provided to members.
(c) Liquid investments:
Liquid investments comprise Government of Canada and provincial government securities, which are carried at the lower of cost and market and earn interest in the range of 3.19% to 5.18% per annum (2005 -3.19% to 6.07% per annum).
 
 
(d) Income taxes:
The Association's wholly owned subsidiary, VCAIII, uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, future tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. Valuation allowances are recorded when the conditions for recording a future tax asset are not met.
(e) Property and equipment:
Furniture and fixtures, computer equipment, office equipment, and software are recorded at historical cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 36 to 60 months. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense.
Property under capital leases is initially recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
(f) Investment:
The investment has been accounted for using the cost method of accounting, whereby it has been initially recorded at cost. Any earnings from the investment are recognized only to the extent received or receivable.
(g) Employee future benefits:
The Association has defined benefit pension plans, for which the benefits are based on years of service and employees' compensation. The cost of this program is being funded currently.
The Association accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans as the employees render the services necessary to earn the employee future benefits. The Association has adopted the following policies:
(i) The cost of retirement benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation and retirement ages.
(ii) For the purpose of calculating expected return on plan assets, those assets are valued at fair value.
(iii) Past service costs from plan amendments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period (9 years) of employees active at the date of the amendment.
(iv) The net actuarial gain (loss) is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period (9 years) of active employees.
(h) Foreign currency translation:
The Association translates foreign currency-denominated transactions and the financial statements of integrated foreign operations into Canadian dollars using the temporal method. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the year-end
 
 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at rates in effect on the dates of the transactions. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the year, with the exception of amortization, which is translated at historic rates. Exchange gains and losses on translation are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the current year.
(i) Use of estimates:
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Accounting estimates have been made with respect to the fair value of the Association's investments, capitalized software, settlement loss risks, and pension liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
Property and equipment amortization expense amounted to $975 (2005$994).
 
In 2003, the Association established a wholly owned subsidiary, VCAIII, to hold its 5% interest in Inovant LLC. The investment is accounted for at cost. Inovant LLC was formed to acquire certain data processing operations of Visa International. The cost of the 5% interest in Inovant was U.S. $757.
During 2006, VCAIII received distributions of U.S. nil from Inovant LLC (2005U.S. $2,636).
 
The Association maintains a defined contribution plan for its employees. In addition, the Association maintains a registered non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded supplemental plan covering certain employees.
 
 
Actuarial valuations are made on the defined benefit plans. The most recent valuation was performed as at January 1, 2006 and the next valuation will be required as at a date no later than January 1, 2007. The reconciliation of the funded status of the defined benefit plans to the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements is as follows:
 
The composition percentages of the fair value of plan assets by major category are as follows:
 
The pension expense for the year was $219 (2005$155) for the registered plan and $256 (2005 - $302) for the supplemental plan and is included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the Association's benefit obligation are shown in the following table:
 
In 2000, employees were given the option of changing to a defined contribution plan. Those employees who elected to switch had their accrued benefits converted to defined contribution account balances. Benefits are based on length of service and final average earnings. The difference between the cumulative amounts expensed and the funding contributions is reflected as either a prepayment or an accrual for pension costs. Employees that join the Association after the year 2000 are enrolled in the defined contribution plan. The pension expense for the year for the defined contribution plan was $459 (2005$355) and is included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.
 
 
The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under a fixed rate capital lease expiring July 30, 2009, together with the balance of the obligation:
 
Interest expense for the current year was nil.
 
The Association derives substantially all of its revenue from fees charged to members for services provided to members. Direct expenses consist primarily of payments to Visa International and Inovant LLC.
The Association generated revenue from members who are represented on the Board of Directors of approximately $112,700, $107,100 and $100,200 for each of the 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years respectively. In aggregate, these members accounted for more than 70% of the Association's total revenue with the two largest members in aggregate accounting for more than 50% of the Association's total revenue in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Three of the Members represented on the Board each individually accounted for 10% or more of the total revenue in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.
Included in other operating expenses are amounts paid to members for services provided in the amount of $2,400, $2,000 and $1,600 for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years respectively. These expenses represent payments for banking and settlement services and for the Association's leased premises.
At September 30, 2006, balances payable to Visa entities were as follows:
(a) Included in accounts receivable is $904 due from Visa International (2005$124 included in accrued and other liabilities due to Visa International), which arose in the normal course of the payment system service and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
(b) included in accounts receivable is $89 (2005$33) due from Visa U.S.A., a Visa International regional member, which arose in the normal course of the payment system service and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
(c) Included in accrued and other liabilities is $2,011 (2005$1,734) due to Inovant LLC, a subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., which arose in the normal course of the payment system service and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
 
 
(d) Included in accrued and other liabilities is $71 (2005$73) due to Visa Europe Services Inc., an affiliated company of Visa International, which arose in the normal course of the payment system service and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
 
Effective October 1, 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides annual grants to eligible executives based on the Association's financial performance over three fiscal years. Each award vests at the end of the third year of the performance cycle and the Association will record its obligation under the Plan, if any, over the three-year period in which the award is earned. For the year ended September 30, 2006, the Association recorded $1,135 (2005$610) in accrued and other liabilities related to the Plan.
 
As a member of Visa International, the Association is contingently responsible for its share of certain potential settlement losses attributable to the failure of any of its or other Visa members. A Risk Stabilization Fund was established for this purpose, and based on Bank for International Settlements standards for capital adequacy, the calculated fund amount is approximately $9,838 (2005$9,201). At September 30, 2006, $7,000 (2005$7,000) was designated for this fund. In the case of a settlement loss, the Association has the right to call on its members to cover any shortfall in funding.
 
The Association leases its office premises and various equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. In addition, the Association is required to pay its pro rata share of common area expenses and property taxes under its premises lease.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
 
 
The carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities, with the exception of liquid investments, approximate their fair values due to the relatively short periods to maturity of these financial instruments.
 
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the financial statement presentation adopted in the current year.
 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Association have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. The significant measurement differences between Canadian and U.S. GAAP affecting the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
 
(a) Employee future benefits:
Canadian and U.S. accounting standards for employee future benefits are substantially consistent; however, U.S. GAAP requires the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (with certain other adjustments) to be reflected as an additional minimum pension liability in the U.S. GAAP consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income. Canadian GAAP does not permit the recognition of a minimum liability representing the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. A U.S. GAAP adjustment is therefore required to record an additional minimum liability for U.S. GAAP purposes.
Additionally, there is a difference between Canadian and U.S. GAAP relating to the amortization of the transitional amounts resulting from differing adoption dates of the standards in Canada and the U.S. The net transitional asset (obligation) and related amortization resulting from the adoption of CICA 3461, in Canada should be reversed for U.S. GAAP purposes.
"Employee Future Benefits,"
(b) Investments:
U.S. GAAP requires securities to be classified as either trading, held to maturity or available-for-sale. The Association has classified all investment securities as available-for-sale under U.S. GAAP, which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of related income taxes, are recorded in other comprehensive income until realized. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in U.S. GAAP income based on market values; declines in fair values are generally presumed to be other than temporary if they have persisted over a number of quarters.
 
 
Prior to the adoption of CICA 3855, under Canadian GAAP, securities are recorded at the lower of amortized cost and market value. Other-than-temporary declines in the value of investment securities are recorded in income based on net realizable values; declines in fair values are generally presumed to be other than temporary if conditions indicating impairment have persisted for a more prolonged period of time than under U.S. GAAP.
"Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement,"
With the adoption of CICA 3855, for periods after October 1, 2006, the accounting for investments is consistent under both U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP.
(c) Comprehensive income:
Canadian GAAP does not require the presentation of comprehensive income. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the components of total comprehensive income in the period in which they are recognized in the financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise arising from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in members' equity during the reporting period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income under U.S. GAAP is as follows:
 
The accumulated other comprehensive income under U.S. GAAP is as follows:
 
(d) Investment in Inovant:
Under Canadian GAAP prior to the adoption of CICA 3855, portfolio investments in equity securities for which an entity does not have control or significant influence are accounted for at cost. The Association, through its wholly owned subsidiary VCAIII, holds a 5% interest in Inovant LLC which has been accounted for at cost under Canadian GAAP as the Association does not maintain significant influence or control over this investment.
Under U.S. GAAP, investments of more than an insignificant amount in limited liability companies that maintain characteristics of a partnership are accounted for under the equity method. Therefore, an adjustment is required to account for the Association's investment in Inovant LLC using the equity method under U.S. GAAP.

US GAAP Basis for Purposes of US GAAP Reconciliation

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Visa Canada Association (the Association) have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (Canadian GAAP) for not-for-profit organizations and interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by Canadian GAAP for annual financial statements. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements of the Association.
The accompanying financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting primarily of normally recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods. Operating results for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2007 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007. These interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting principles and methods of application as the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2006, except as described in note 2 below.
The Association is a not-for profit organization exempt from income taxes under Section 149(1)(I) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), provided certain requirements are met. It is management's belief that the requirements for not-for-profit status continue to be met and that the financial statements should be prepared on the basis of the Association's tax exempt status. In the event that the Association is deemed not to operate on a not-for-profit basis, the surplus earned from the date of the change in status would be subject to income taxes.
 
The Association has adopted the new financial instruments standards: CICA 3855, Financial InstrumentsRecognition and Measurement, and CICA 1530, Comprehensive Income, effective October 1, 2006. CICA 3855 prescribes when a financial asset, financial liability, or derivative is to be recognized on the balance sheet and the measurement of such amount. It also specifies how financial instrument gains and losses are to be presented. CICA 1530 introduces new standards for the presentation and disclosure of components of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in net assets of an enterprise during a reporting period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The adoption of these standards resulted in reduction in net assets of $42 to establish the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of October 1, 2006. This adjustment reflects the difference between the cost and fair value of the Association's investments in fixed income debt securities at the date of adoption of these new standards. The adoption of these new standards did not have any impact on excess (deficiency) of revenue over expenses on the consolidated statement of operations of the Association.
The Association classifies its investments in fixed income debt securities and its investment in Inovant as available-for-sale. The investments in fixed income debt securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices; the investment in Inovant is carried at cost, as it has no quoted market price in an active market. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of financial position. If the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below its cost and the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the difference between the fair value of the investment and its cost. Net realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in other income on the consolidated statement of operations. Interest and dividends, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, are recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and are determined using the effective interest rate method.
 
 
During the nine months ended June 30, 2007, VCA III did not receive any distributions from Inovant LLC (2006nil).
 
The pension expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 was $136 (2006$166 for the nine months ended June 30) for the registered non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and $332 (2006$194 for the nine months ended June 30) for the unfunded supplemental plan and is included in other operating expenses on the statement of operations.
Effective February 2007, the Association has access to a letter of credit in the amount of $4.1 million, which is in place to secure its unfunded supplemental pension plan obligation. The Association has not drawn on this letter of credit in any period to date to fund its supplemental pension plan obligations.
 
The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under a fixed rate capital lease expiring July 30, 2009, together with the balance of the obligation:
 
Interest expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 was $1 (2006$nil for the nine months ended June 30).
 
The Association derives substantially all of its revenue from fees charged to members for services provided to members. Direct expenses consist primarily of payments to Visa International and Inovant LLC.
The Association generated revenue from members who are represented on the Board of Directors of approximately $92,728 and $81,861 for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 respectively. In aggregate, these members accounted for more than 70% of the Association's total revenue with the two largest members in aggregate accounting for more than 50% of the Association's total revenue. Three of the Members represented on the Board of Directors each individually accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for the nine month periods ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.
 
 
Included in other operating expenses are amounts paid to Members for services provided in the amount of $1,900 and $1,700 for the nine month periods ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 respectively. The expenses represent payments for banking and settlement services and for the Association's leased premises.
At June 30, 2007, balances payable to Visa entities were as follows:
(a) Included in accounts receivable is $58 (September 30, 2006$904) due from Visa International, which arose in the normal course of the payment system service, and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
(b) Included in accounts receivable is $134 (September 30, 2006$89) due from Visa U.S.A., a Visa International regional member, which arose in the normal course of the payment system service, and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
(c) Included in accrued and other liabilities is $1,553 (September 30, 2006$2,011) due to Inovant LLC., a subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., which arose in the normal course of the payment system services, and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
(d) Included in accrued and other liabilities is $92 (September 30, 2006$71) due to Visa Europe Services Inc., an affiliated company of Visa International, which arose in the normal course of the payment system service, and is measured at the exchange amount agreed to by the related parties.
 
Effective October 1, 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides annual grants to eligible executives based on the Association's financial performance over three fiscal years. Each award vests at the end of the third year of the performance cycle and the Association will record its obligation under the Plan, if any, over the three-year period in which the award is earned. For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the Association recorded $1,641 (2006$1,135) in accrued and other liabilities related to the Plan.
 
 
As a member of Visa International, the Association is contingently responsible for its share of certain potential losses attributable to the failure of any of its or other Visa members. A Risk Stabilization Fund was established for this purpose, and based on Bank for International Settlements standards for capital adequacy, the calculated fund amount is approximately $9,764 (2006$9,838). At June 30, 2007, $9,764 (2006$7,000) was designated for this fund. In the case of a settlement loss, the Association has the right to call on its members to cover any shortfall in funding.
Settlement risk guarantee:
The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated based on a model which is used to estimate member settlement exposure in conjunction with Visa's global risk policies and procedures. This model incorporates certain assumptions relating to member settlement exposure and historical loss and recovery experience. As of June 30, 2007, the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee was nil.
 
 
The Association leases its office premises and various equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. In addition, the Association is required to pay its pro rata share of common area expenses and property taxes under its premises lease.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
 
 
The carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities, with the exception of investment in Inovant LLC, approximate their fair values due to the relatively short periods to maturity of these financial instruments.
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Association have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. The significant measurement differences between Canadian and U.S. GAAP affecting the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
 
 
 
Canadian and U.S. accounting standards for employee future benefits are substantially consistent; however, U.S. GAAP requires the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (with certain other adjustments) to be reflected as an additional minimum pension liability in the U.S. GAAP consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income. Canadian GAAP does not permit the recognition of a minimum liability representing the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. A U.S. GAAP adjustment is therefore required to record an additional minimum liability for U.S. GAAP purposes.
Additionally, there is a difference between Canadian and U.S. GAAP relating to the amortization of the transitional amounts resulting from differing adoption dates of the standards in Canada and the U.S. The net transitional asset (obligation) and related amortization resulting from the adoption of CICA 3461, Employee Future Benefits, in Canada are reversed for U.S. GAAP purposes.
(b) Investments:
U.S. GAAP requires securities to be classified as either trading, held to maturity or available-for-sale. The Association has classified all investment securities as available-for-sale under U.S. GAAP, which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of related income taxes, are recorded in other comprehensive income until realized. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in U.S. GAAP income based on market values, declines in fair values are generally presumed to be other than temporary if they have persisted over a number of quarters.
Prior to the adoption of CICA 3855, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, under Canadian GAAP, securities are recorded at the lower of amortized cost and market value. Other-than-temporary declines in the value of investment securities are recorded in income based on net realizable values; declines in fair values are generally presumed to be other than temporary if conditions indicating impairment have persisted for a more prolonged period of time than under U.S. GAAP.
With the adoption of CICA 3855, for periods after October 1, 2006, the accounting for investments is consistent under both U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP.
 
For periods prior to October 1, 2006, Canadian GAAP does not require the presentation of comprehensive income. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the components of total comprehensive income in the period in which they are recognized in the financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise arising from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in members' equity during the reporting period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
 
 
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income under U.S. GAAP is as follows:
 
The accumulated other comprehensive income under U.S. GAAP is as follows:
 
Upon the adoption of CICA 1530, Comprehensive Income, as of October 1, 2006, other comprehensive income is presented on the statement of financial position and net assets for Canadian GAAP purposes.
 
Under Canadian GAAP prior to the adoption of CICA 3855, portfolio investments in equity securities for which an entity does not have control or significant influence are accounted for at cost. The Association, through its wholly owned subsidiary VCA III, holds a 5% interest in Inovant LLC which has been accounted for at cost under Canadian GAAP as the Association does not maintain significant influence or control over this investment. Upon the adoption of CICA 3855, the Association has classified its investment in Inovant LLC as available-for-sale and continues to record at cost as Inovant LLC does not have a quoted market price in an active market.
Under U.S. GAAP, investments of more than an insignificant amount in limited liability companies that maintain characteristics of a partnership are accounted for under the equity method. Therefore, an adjustment is required to account for the Association's investment in Inovant LLC using the equity method under U.S. GAAP.

Exhibit 99.2
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by applying pro forma adjustments to the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007, the historical audited consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 and the historical unaudited interim consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007, of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada, included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus, to give pro forma effect to the restructuring under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP for financial accounting reporting purposes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 gives effect to the restructuring as if it had occurred on June 30, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give effect to the restructuring as if it had occurred on October 1, 2005.
We have applied pro forma adjustments to reflect the following:
 
 
 
Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have actually been reported had the proposed restructuring occurred on the assumed dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future financial position or results of operations as of or for any future date or periods.
The pro forma information presented, including allocations of purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed, available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual adjustments to our historical combined financial statements upon the closing of the restructuring will be based on the net assets acquired at that date and will depend on a number of factors, including completion of the appraisal of the net assets acquired upon consummation of the restructuring. Therefore, the actual entries we will record to account for the restructuring will differ from the pro forma adjustments presented below.

Background and Historical Cross-Ownership
Presently, the global Visa enterprise includes four major separate incorporated entities: Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe. At June 30, 2007, Visa U.S.A. held a 69% ownership interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Inovant, and an estimated 26% membership interest in Visa International. The remaining 31% ownership interest in Inovant is held by Visa International (including a portion held by the members of the unincorporated regions), Visa Canada and Visa Europe. The remaining estimated 74% membership interest in Visa International is held by Visa Europe, Visa Canada and the members of the unincorporated regions. The estimated membership interests held are based on the member's dividend and dissolution rights under the bylaws of Visa International. The rights are based upon the cumulative volume-based service fees paid by members to Visa International since inception, as a percentage of total volume-based service fees received. Therefore, the percentage of ownership fluctuates over time.
Restructuring Transactions
Visa Inc. will participate in the restructuring, which includes a series of integrated transactions involving Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada, with members of each entity exchanging their membership interests in these entities for shares of common stock of Visa Inc. Visa Europe will remain owned and governed by its European member banks but will exchange its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant for a minority shareholding in Visa Inc. and other consideration. Additionally, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will enter into a framework agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. Under these agreements, Visa Inc. will grant to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use, within the Visa Europe region, the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by Visa Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries in exchange for an annual fee. Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will provide each other with transitional and ongoing services similar to those services currently provided among Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada, Inovant and Visa Europe. Additionally, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will enter into a put-call option agreement (see Note 3 "" to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for more information).
Visa Europe Transaction
Purchase Accounting
The restructuring will be accounted for as a purchase under the guidelines of SFAS No. 141 "" with Visa U.S.A. deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Visa International and Visa Canada. As a result of the exchange of ownership interests, Visa U.S.A. will acquire the remaining ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant not currently held. This transaction will be accounted for as a step acquisition with the net assets underlying the interests acquired being recorded at fair value. Visa U.S.A. will further acquire 100% of Visa Canada and record the acquisition of the underlying net assets at fair value.
Business Combinations
Purchase Consideration
Participating Regions
The initial allocation of Visa Inc. common stock to the financial institution members of the unincorporated regions of Visa International and the shareholders of Visa Canada, which we collectively refer to as the participating regions, was based on each participating region's projected net income contribution to the overall projected combined Visa enterprise in fiscal 2008, after giving effect to negotiated adjustments. The value of the purchase consideration conveyed to the Visa Canada and Visa International regional members was determined by valuing the businesses contributed after giving effect to negotiated adjustments agreed to by each party. As Visa Inc. is a newly created entity with no quoted market price and did not previously exist as a combined entity, we
 
determined that purchase consideration would be more reliably measured by valuing the contributed businesses as opposed to valuing the Visa Inc. stock exchanged. We utilized three standard valuation methodologies including an analysis of comparable public companies, a 2-year forward earnings multiple analysis and a precedent transaction analysis to calculate the value of the contributed businesses.
Visa Europe
Visa Europe will remain owned and governed by its European member banks. The value of the purchase consideration provided to Visa Europe in exchange for its membership interest in Visa International was derived, for financial accounting reporting purposes, by valuing each of the individual elements comprising the overall Visa Europe transaction to arrive at the residual value exchanged.
The elements that Visa Europe will receive will include:
 
 
 
 
The elements that Visa Inc. will receive will include:
 
 
 
Visa Inc. and Visa Europe have mutually agreed to enter into a framework agreement, which provides for the above described trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 3 "" to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for a full description of all the elements of the transaction with Visa Europe including a discussion of the determination of fair value of each element.
Visa Europe Transaction
Measurement Date
For the purpose of this unaudited pro forma financial information, we have preliminarily estimated the value of total purchase consideration at June 15, 2007, which we refer to as the measurement date and which is the date at which all parties entered into the restructuring agreement.
Using the above described methods, we determined the total purchase consideration to be approximately $17.3 billion as follows:
 
 
See Note 3 "" for further information regarding the Visa Europe's put option and the obligation under the framework agreement.

Purchase Consideration Allocation
The following table sets forth the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill assuming that the restructuring occurred on June 30, 2007. The fair values and remaining useful lives of these net assets have been estimated based on our preliminary appraisal. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the restructuring will be based on the net assets acquired at that date and will depend on a number of factors, including completion of an appraisal of the net assets acquired upon consummation. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments presented.
The allocation of total purchase consideration to net tangible and intangible assets acquired and to goodwill is as follows:
 
 
Historically, Visa Canada has reported its financial position and results of operations under the not-for-profit guidelines of Canadian GAAP. For the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, we have applied pro forma adjustments to the balance sheet of Visa Canada at June 30, 2007, and its statements of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 as reconciled to U.S. GAAP. The currency exchange rate between Canadian dollars (or CAD) and U.S. dollars (or USD) at June 30, 2007 was used to translate all Visa Canada's financial information in this pro forma presentation. This exchange rate was 1.0634 CAD per U.S. dollar. See Note 11 "" to the June 30, 2007 consolidated financial statements of Visa Canada and Note 12 "" to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 audited historical consolidated financial statements of Visa Canada for a reconciliation of Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP applicable to the financial position and results of operations of Visa Canada.

As part of the restructuring, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will enter into a multi-element arrangement. Under this agreement, for financial accounting reporting purposes, in exchange for its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant, Visa Europe will receive the following consideration:
Class EU (Series I) and (Series III) Common Stock and Class C (Series I), (Series III) and (Series IV) Common Stock
At the date of restructuring, Visa Europe will receive an approximate 8.1% ownership interest in Visa Inc. in the form of class EU (series I) and class EU (series III) common stock. The class EU (series I) and (series III) common stock will be classified as permanent equity by Visa Inc. after the date of the restructuring and will convert on a one-to-one basis into shares of class C (series III) and class C (series IV) common stock at the date of the true-up (see "" included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus for further information).
The Global Restructuring AgreementTrue-Up of Merger Consideration
In addition to the other class C series except class C (series II) common stock, the class C (series III) and class C (series IV) common stock are subject to redemption in the manner provided by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Redemption is contingent upon the successful completion of an initial public offering of our class A common stock. We intend to use a portion, as determined by our board of directors, of the proceeds from our initial public offering to fund this redemption.
We have determined the fair value of Visa Europe's 8.1% ownership interest in Visa Inc. to be approximately $3.1 billion at the date of restructuring based on the value of the purchase consideration provided to the participating regions in exchange for their historical membership interests in Visa International and Visa Canada.
Class EU (Series II) Common Stock and Class C (Series II) Common Stock
At the date of restructuring, Visa Europe will receive an approximate 3.6% ownership interest in Visa Inc. common stock in the form of class EU (series II) common stock. The class EU (series II) common stock will be classified in permanent equity, as it provides equity rights similar to that of the other regional classes of shares and will convert on a one-to-one basis into shares of class C (series II) common stock at the date of the true-up (see "" included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus for further information).
The Global Restructuring AgreementTrue-Up of Merger Consideration
The class C (series II) common stock is subject to redemption by Visa Inc. We are entitled to redeem all, but not less than all, of these shares held by Visa Europe any time after the later of the date of admission to trading of our class A common stock on an internationally recognized securities exchange, which we refer to as the initial public offering date, or 369 days after the Inovant U.S. holdco merger. In addition, Visa Europe is entitled to require us to redeem all, but not less than all, of these shares at any time after the later of 60 days after to the initial public offering date or 429 days after the Inovant U.S. holdco merger. Upon the occurrence of the initial public offering date, for financial accounting purposes, we intend to classify this stock at its then fair value as temporary or mezzanine level equity in our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, over the period from the initial public offering date to the date the stock is first redeemable at the option of Visa Europe, which we refer to as the accretion period, we will accrete this stock to its redemption price through our retained earnings. We will further report earnings per share on the two-class method to reflect the impact of this accretion on the net income available to common stockholders (see below for further information). The redemption price of the class C (series II) common stock is equal to $1.146 billion adjusted for dividends and certain other adjustments (see "" included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus for further information regarding the class C (series II) common stock, including a complete description of the calculation of the redemption price).

We have determined the initial fair value of the class C (series II) common stock to be approximately $1.104 billion at the date of restructuring. We determined fair value by discounting the redemption price using a
 
risk-free rate based on the probability and timing of the successful completion of an initial public offering of our class A common stock, this event would cause the class C (series II) common stock to become redeemable at the estimated redemption price.
For the purposes of presenting earnings per share in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, we have assumed that we will not file an initial registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with our initial public offering of our common stock during the period covered by the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. We have therefore reported earnings per share as a single class. However, it is our intention to file such registration statement on Form S-1 as soon as it is feasible after the restructuring. As described above, if we are successful in executing an initial public offering of our common stock, we will reclassify the class C (series II) common stock as temporary or mezzanine level equity in our consolidated balance sheet and accrete this stock to its redemption price through retained earnings. We estimate that the total amount of accretion will be approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between its initial fair value and its redemption price assuming no applicable adjustments. The total amount of accretion will reduce the amount of net income available to common stockholders for the purpose of calculated basic and diluted earnings per share during the accretion period.
The Put-Call Option Agreement
Under the put-call option agreement between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe, we are entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time following certain triggering dates, but in any event not before the closing of our initial public offering. A triggering event will occur if: (A) there is a 25% or greater decline in the number of merchants and a 45% or greater decline in the number of automated teller machines in Visa Europe's region that accept Visa-branded products; (B) such rate of decline in each case is at least twice as much as both: (i) the average rate of decline in the number of merchants and ATMs in the Visa Europe region that accept general payment cards and (ii) the average rate of decline in acceptance, if any, in the number of merchants and ATMs outside of Visa Europe's region that accept Visa-branded cards; and (C) Visa Europe has failed to deliver and implement a remediation plan within six months of the occurrence of such events. Further, Visa Europe is entitled to require us to purchase from the members of Visa Europe all of its share capital any time after the earlier of 365 days following the initial public offering date or 605 days after the closing date of the restructuring. The price per share at which both the call and put option are exercisable is calculated using a formula principally based on Visa Europe's projected financial performance, identified synergies expected to be realized upon combination of the entities and our forward P/E ratio (see "" included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus for further information).
Material ContractsThe Put-Call Option Agreement
We have determined that the call option contained in the put-call option agreement has nominal value at the date of the restructuring, since the conditions under which the call is exercisable are deemed remote. We have determined that at the date of the restructuring the fair value of the put option is approximately $417 million, which has been recorded as a long-term liability in our unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. Subsequent to the restructuring, this liability will be carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in our statement of operations similar to the treatment required by of SFAS No. 133 "" and reclassified as a short-term liability when it becomes exercisable within one year.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We determined the fair value of the put option using probability-weighted models designed to estimate our future liability under various future exercise scenarios. These models were designed to approximate the current value of our liability assuming Visa Europe exercised their put option at various times and under various economic conditions in the future. The key assumptions used in these models were dictated by the various elements of the put option strike price calculation and the fair value of Visa Europe. This included Visa Europe's projected financial performance, which we estimated using a wide range of growth scenarios, identified synergies, which we estimated will approximate those a market participant would expect to realize upon combination and our anticipated price-to-earnings ratio on the date of exercise, which we assumed based on comparable public companies and other analyses.
 
The Framework Agreement
The relationship between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will be governed after the restructuring by a framework agreement, which provides for bilateral services and trademark and technology licenses.
The Bilateral Services
Visa Inc. and Visa Europe will provide each other with transitional and ongoing services similar to those services currently provided among Visa International, Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada, Inovant and Visa Europe. Visa Inc. will provide Visa Europe with authorization services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on the other hand, as well as clearing and settlement services both within Visa Europe's region until Visa Europe's regional clearing and settlement system is deployed (at which time this service will cease) and between Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. In addition, until Visa Europe's regional clearing and settlement system is deployed, the parties will share foreign exchange revenues related to currency conversion for transactions involving European cardholders as well as other cross-border transactions that take place in Visa Europe's region. The parties will also use each others' switching and processing services.
Visa Europe will indemnify Visa Inc. for any claims arising out of the provision of the services brought by Visa Europe's member banks against Visa Inc., while Visa Inc. will indemnify Visa Europe for any claims arising out of the provision of the services brought against Visa Europe by Visa Inc.'s customer banks.
We have determined that no material value was exchanged in the bilateral services agreement above or below fair value as a result of agreeing to receive or perform services at specified rates. We made this determination by comparing the pricing specified in the agreement to those routinely charged by comparable third party service providers. As a result, we have not recorded an asset or liability to reflect an obligation to provide or receive services at above or below fair value.
The Trademark and Technology Licenses
The licensors will grant to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology-related intellectual property owned by the licensors and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system, which we refer to as the field. Visa Europe's region consists of the European Union and Andorra, Bear Island, the Channel Islands, the Faeroe Islands, Gibraltar, Greenland, Iceland, the Isle of Man, Israel, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland, Turkey, and Vatican City, and any other jurisdiction that becomes a full member state of the European Union in the future. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees, such as processors, for use within Visa Europe's region and in certain limited circumstances, outside the Visa Europe region.
From the restructuring closing date until the earlier of (i) one year from the restructuring closing date, and (ii) the filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with an initial public offering of Visa Inc. common stock, the fee payable for the licenses will be $6.0 million per quarter. Thereafter until the later of (i) the initial public offering date and (ii) 369 days after the Inovant U.S. holdco merger, the fee payable for the licenses will be $142.5 million per year, payable quarterly ($35.6 million per quarter), which we refer to as the quarterly base fee, reduced by an amount equal to $1.146 billion multiplied by the three-month LIBOR rate plus 100 to 200 basis points, which we refer to as the first fee reduction component in this "." Based on the applicable three-month LIBOR rate at June 30, 2007 of 5.36%, the first fee reduction component in the initial quarter following the initial public offering date would total approximately $18.2 million. The first fee reduction component will cease upon the later of 369 days after the Inovant U.S. holdco merger or the initial public offering date. Should the initial public offering date occur prior to the date which falls 369 days after the Inovant U.S. holdco merger, for the period between these two dates, the quarterly base fee will further be reduced by an amount equal to the product of the following: (i) the net price per share of our class A common stock on the initial public offering date; (ii) the number of shares of Visa Inc. held
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
 
by Visa Europe (other than class EU (series II) or class C (series II) shares) that would have been redeemed immediately, but for provisions that delay the redemption of shares held by Visa Europe until one year following the date of the initial public offering; and (iii) the three-month LIBOR rate plus 100 to 200 basis points, which we refer to as the second fee reduction component in this "." Beginning three years after Visa Europe begins to pay the quarterly base fee (subject to the first and second fee reduction components), this fee will be increased annually based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union.
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
We determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement and consultation with third party valuation experts, that the quarterly base fee as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union approximates fair value. As a result of the first and second fee reduction components, the trademark and technology license agreement represents a contract for financial accounting purposes that is below fair value. Therefore, we have recorded a liability of approximately $132.8 million to reflect our obligation to provide this license at below fair value.
This liability of $132.8 million was calculated assuming that we will file an initial registration statement on Form S-1 with respect to an initial public offering of our common stock and that the initial public offering date will occur three months and six months, respectively, subsequent to the restructuring. Therefore, in the initial quarter subsequent to the restructuring, Visa Europe will pay us a fee of $6.0 million, which is approximately $29.6 million below the fair value of approximately $35.6 million. Assuming the filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 in respect of an initial public offering of our common stock in the second quarter following the restructuring, the quarterly fee amount Visa Europe will pay us will increase to $35.6 million reduced by the first fee reduction component. Upon the assumed initial public offering date approximately six months following the restructuring, the fee amount will further be reduced by the second fee reduction component. We have estimated that the total first and second fee reduction components applicable in the year following the restructuring will be approximately $56.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively. In estimating the second fee reduction component we have assumed that the product of: (i) the net price per share of our class A common stock on the initial public offering date; (ii) the number of shares of Visa Inc. held by Visa Europe (other than class EU (series II) or class C (series II) shares) that would have been redeemed immediately, but for provisions that delay the redemption of shares held by Visa Europe until one year following the date of the initial public offering; and (iii) a three-month LIBOR rate of 5.36% plus 100 to 200 basis points will be approximately $96.2 million. These assumptions represent our best estimate of the future impact of these terms of the framework agreement.
The application of the three-month LIBOR rate plus 100 to 200 basis points in determining the first and second fee reduction components represents a variable interest element embedded within the framework agreement, which we will treat as an embedded derivative with changes in fair value reflected in our statement of operations under the guidelines of SFAS No. 133. This embedded derivative does not impact the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of historical Visa U.S.A. total member equity and Visa Inc. total pro forma equity as of June 30, 2007 to reflect the application of combination and purchase accounting adjustments.
 
 
The state of California, where both Visa International and Visa U.S.A. are headquartered, has historically not taxed a substantial portion of the reported net income of these companies on the basis that both operate on a cooperative or mutual basis and are therefore eligible for a special deduction pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code 24405, which we refer to as the special deduction. As taxpayers eligible for the special deduction, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International were generally only subject to California taxation on non-member/owner income. Therefore, the majority of each company's income was not historically taxable.
Subsequent to the restructuring, we believe that Visa Inc. will continue to be eligible to claim the special deduction afforded and will continue to be largely exempt from California taxation. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustment has been applied to this unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information to reflect the potential increase in our California state income tax rate, its impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax expenses and benefits, as a result of losing the benefit of the special deduction.
On or after completion of an initial public offering or other material changes to our operations, we believe that there is the potential that Visa Inc. may lose eligibility for the special deduction. It is our intention to file a registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to the initial public offering of our class A common stock as soon as it is feasible after the restructuring. If we were to lose eligibility for the special deduction, our state tax effective rate would increase by approximately 3%, net of federal tax benefit. Had ineligibility for the special deduction been reflected as of October 1, 2005 in the unaudited condensed combined pro forma statements of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, our income tax expense would have been increased and net income would have been decreased by approximately $22.7 million. A corresponding effective tax rate increase reported in the unaudited condensed combined pro forma statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 would have resulted in an increase in income tax expense and decrease in net income of approximately $42.3 million. The loss of the special deduction would not have resulted in a material impact on total equity reported in our unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2007.
 
The following describes the combination and pro forma adjustments we applied to the unaudited balance sheets of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada at June 30, 2007, derived from their historical financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus, to reflect the restructuring as if it had occurred on June 30, 2007 and the pro forma adjustments we applied to the statements of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2007 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada, derived from their historical financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus, to reflect the restructuring as if it had it occurred on October 1, 2005.

On November 7, 2007, Visa Inc. ("Visa") announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with American Express to settle previously disclosed litigation, that has been pending since 2004.
American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al,
The settlement ends all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa International Service Association ("Visa International") and their members related to this case. In addition, the settlement resolves American Express's actual or potential claims against the named banks in this case: US Bank, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One. The agreement covering the named bank defendants absolves them of all responsibility in this matter related to their participation in the Visa and MasterCard networks. The settlement will ultimately be funded by members of Visa U.S.A.not Visa Inc.through Visa's retrospective responsibility plan as described in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by Visa with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its recent global reorganization.
The effectiveness of the settlement agreement is subject to the requisite approval of Visa U.S.A.'s member financial institutions in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation.
Under the settlement agreement, American Express will receive $945 million from Visa and an additional $185 million payment to be paid directly by the named bank defendants by March 15, 2008 and no later than March 31, 2008. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 5% of American Express's United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of $70 million per quarter, provided, however, that if a payment for any quarter is less than $70 million, the maximum payment for a future quarter or quarters shall be increased by the difference between $70 million and such lesser amount that was actually paid. Visa's nominal payout is $2.065 billion with an accounting reserve of $1.9 billion. Under the retrospective responsibility plan, Visa intends that the payments will be funded from Visa's escrow in connection with the adjustment of the Visa U.S.A. members' equity allocation.
A copy of the press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
SAN FRANCISCO  November 7, 2007  Visa Inc. announced today that the litigation with American Express pending since 2004 has been settled. The settlement will ultimately be funded by members of Visa USA  not Visa Inc.  through the company's retrospective responsibility plan, a series of agreements with U.S. financial institutions to fund financial obligations of certain litigation, including this case. The plan was described in Visa Inc.'s recent S-4 filing.
The settlement agreement, which is contingent upon Visa USA member approval, ends all current litigation between American Express and Visa USA, Visa International and their members related to this issue. By settling this litigation Visa is not conceding any liability in the dispute. In addition, the settlement resolves American Express's actual or potential claims against the named bank defendants in this case: US Bank, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One. The agreement covering the bank defendants absolves them of all responsibility in this matter related to their participation in the Visa and MasterCard networks.
"Visa is doing what is in the best interests of its membership and the new organization" said Visa Inc. CEO and Chairman Joseph W. Saunders. "Our retrospective responsibility plan and these settlement agreements reduce risk and uncertainty for our members and Visa. I believe this is a positive resolution for Visa and its financial institutions."
Under the proposed agreement, American Express will receive $945 million from Visa and an additional payment from the bank defendants by March 15 and no later than March 31, 2008. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million a quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. Visa's nominal payout is $2.065 billion with an accounting reserve of $1.9 billion and a net present value to Visa of $1.8 billion.
The member institutions of Visa USA  and not Visa Inc.  bear the responsibility for funding the settlement through the application of Visa's retrospective responsibility plan. The plan includes a multi-step mechanism to fund financial obligations of Visa USA and Visa International related to certain litigation, including the American Express case. Through this mechanism, any payments made by Visa Inc. as part of this settlement ultimately will be reimbursed by Visa USA member institutions.
"With this dispute behind us, Visa will remain focused on being a global payments leader," Saunders said. "We are confident in our competitive position and the value we provide our customers with our comprehensive suite of products, secure and reliable payment system, and leading global brand and merchant acceptance."
Visa operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network providing processing services and payment product platforms. This includes consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, which are offered under the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Visa enjoys unsurpassed acceptance around the world and Visa/PLUS is one of the world's largest global ATM networks, offering cash access in local currency in more than 170 countries.

PROPOSAL 1: AMENDMENTS TO SECTIONS 4.1 AND 4.12 OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
On December 19, 2007, our board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to our stockholders for approval, amendments to Sections 4.1 and 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation.
General.
In October 2007, we consummated a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to this reorganization, the global Visa enterprise included four major separately incorporated entities: Visa U.S.A., Inc. (which we refer to as Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (which we refer to as Visa International), Visa Canada Association (which we refer to as Visa Canada) and Visa Europe Limited (which we refer to as Visa Europe). Through our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became our subsidiaries. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc. at the time of the reorganization, but exchanged its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., for a minority shareholding in our common stock and other consideration.
Background to Amendments to Sections 4.1 and 4.12.
On November 9, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC) relating to a proposed initial public offering of our class A common stock (which we refer to as our initial public offering). Such registration statement has yet to become effective. During the course of preparing to file our registration statement, our management, aided by our legal and financial advisors, conducted a review of our certificate of incorporation in light of our proposed initial public offering and consulted with the proposed underwriters of our proposed initial public offering regarding any changes to our certificate of incorporation that might be advisable to facilitate the consummation of our proposed initial public offering in an efficient manner that offers the greatest opportunity to provide maximum value to our stockholders. As a result of its review, our management proposed to our board of directors that our board of directors consider making the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation in order to facilitate our proposed initial public offering. After considering the proposed amendments and discussing them with our legal and financial advisors, our board of directors has determined that the amendments described in this proposal are advisable to facilitate our proposed initial public offering and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that the total number of shares of all classes of stock that we are authorized to issue is 2,004,199,484,030 shares, consisting of:
Amendments to Section 4.1.

The amendments to Section 4.1, if approved by our stockholders, would:
 
 
 
The full text of the proposed amended version of Section 4.1 of our certificate of incorporation, marked to show all changes from those sections currently in effect, is attached as
Appendix A
to this proxy statement.
Our reorganization was consummated in a manner which allowed Visa Europe to be in a position to qualify for the "substantial shareholding" tax exemption under English law. Under English law, a holder of a "substantial shareholding" may be in a position to qualify for an exemption from capital gains tax upon a disposition of those shares if it holds the shares throughout a continuous period of 12 months, beginning not more than 24 months prior to the disposition of such shares. For these purposes, a "substantial shareholding" means shares entitling the holder to not less than 10% of a company's ordinary share capital, not less than 10% of the profits available for distribution to equity holders and not less than 10% of the assets of the company available for distribution to equity holders upon a winding up of the company.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.1.
In order to enable Visa Europe to be in a position to qualify for this exemption, our current certificate of incorporation provides that if, at any time prior to the date that is 369 days after the date on which Inovant Inc. is merged into Visa Inc. in connection with the restructuring, there occurs any transaction or other event as a result of which the shares of our class EU (series I) common stock, class EU (series II) common stock, class EU (series III) common stock, class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock or class C (series IV) common stock (or the common stock into which any such class EU or class C common stock may convert or has been converted) owned by Visa Europe and Visa Europe Services, Inc., (which we refer to as VESI), would represent, in the aggregate, less than 10% of: (i) our ordinary share capital (within the meaning of Section 832 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988), (ii) our profits available for distribution to our "equity holders" (computed in accordance with Schedule 18 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as adapted by paragraph 8 Schedule 7AC of the English Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act of 1992, or TCGA), and (iii) the assets that would be available to our equity holders upon our dissolution or other winding up (or any such other event with respect to our share capital occurs as would cause Visa Europe to fail the "substantial shareholding" test as set out in paragraph 8 Schedule 7AC of the TCGA in respect of its holding of shares of common stock), then such transaction or other event will have no effect unless we issue to Visa Europe, prior thereto, a number of shares of our class C (series II) common stock (or class EU (series II) common stock, if prior to the conversion of our class EU (series II) common stock into Class C (series II) common stock) such that, immediately after giving effect to such issuances, the shares of our class EU (series I) common stock, class EU (series II) common stock, class EU (series III) common stock, class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock and class C (series

IV) common stock (or the common stock into which any such class EU or class C common stock may convert or have been converted) owned by Visa Europe and VESI represent, in the aggregate, at least 10% of: (a) our ordinary share capital, (b) our profits available for distribution to our equity holders and (c) the assets that would be available to our equity holders upon our dissolution or other winding up, such that the test referred to above would be satisfied (we refer to such rights granted to Visa Europe as the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights).
In connection with our proposed initial public offering, we anticipate that we will be required to issue shares of our class A common stock to the underwriters of that offering. As set forth in our certificate of incorporation and the registration statement filed in connection with our proposed initial public offering, we anticipate that a primary use of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering will be to redeem shares of our outstanding common stock, however, prior to the occurrence of this redemption, we anticipate that as a result of our issuance of shares of our class A common stock to our underwriters in connection with our proposed initial public offering, the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding will increase and such issuance will trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights. All outstanding shares of our class EU (series II) common stock will be converted into shares of our class C (series II) common stock prior to the consummation of our proposed initial public offering. The class C (series II) common stock is subject to redemption in the manner provided by our certificate of incorporation. As indicated in our registration statement, we do not believe that this issuance will have a cash impact or affect our financial results, including earnings per share, as the shares will be classified as temporary equity and will be redeemed together with all other outstanding shares of class C (series II) common stock for a net aggregate price of $1.146 billion (subject to adjustment as described above) on or about October 10, 2008.
In addition, as part of the retrospective responsibility plan implemented in connection with our reorganization and designed to address potential liabilities arising from certain litigation that we refer to as the "covered litigation", we have entered into a litigation management agreement with certain persons who are affiliated with or acting for certain members of Visa U.S.A. The litigation committee has the authority to require us to conduct follow-on offerings of our shares of class A common stock, which we refer to as loss shares, under certain circumstances. Such additional issuances of our shares of class A common stock may trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights. Further, additional circumstances (such as our recent settlement of litigation with American Express) may trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights.
The proposed amendments to Section 4.1 of our certificate of incorporation are intended to ensure that we have sufficient authorized shares of our class EU (series II) common stock and class C (series II) common stock which could be used from time to time, without further action or authorization by our stockholders, except as may be required by our certificate of incorporation, applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our securities may then be listed, to implement the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, as more fully described above.
If our stockholders do not approve the proposed amendments to Section 4.1, it may be more difficult or impossible for us to complete our proposed initial public offering or we may be forced to delay our proposed initial public offering or to complete our proposed initial public offering at a lower price or on other terms that are relatively less advantageous to our existing stockholders than the terms that might be available to us if the proposed amendments to Section 4.1 are approved. Among other possible outcomes, the failure to approve the proposed amendments to Section 4.1 may force us to limit the number of shares of class A common stock that we sell to the public in connection with our proposed initial public offering, which would have the effect of limiting the amounts available redeem shares of class B common stock and class C common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation.
We do not intend to seek authorization from stockholders for issuance of additional shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock unless required to do so. At the date of this proxy statement, we have no agreements, commitments or definitive plans, other than the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, with respect to the sale or issuance of the additional shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock that would be authorized by the proposed amendment.
 
Table of Contents
Each of the class C (series II) common stock and the class EU (series II) common stock is non-voting and, as such, neither the authorization nor the issuance of additional shares of such common stock will have any impact on the proportionate voting power or rights of any stockholder. We do not believe that this issuance will have a cash impact or affect our financial results, including earnings per share, as the shares will be classified as temporary equity and will be redeemed together with all other outstanding class C (series II) common stock for a net aggregate price of $1.146 billion (subject to adjustment as described above) on or about October 10, 2008. To the extent that the additional authorized shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock are issued in the future, such issuance may temporarily decrease existing stockholders' (other than Visa Europe's) percentage equity ownership until such time as the class C (series II) common stock is redeemed as described above).
In general, except for the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, no holders of any shares of our outstanding capital stock will be entitled to preemptive rights to subscribe for any shares of any class or series of our capital stock (which means that current stockholders other than Visa Europe do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of common stock in order to maintain their proportionate ownership of common stock). We do not intend to grant preemptive rights by a resolution of our board of directors or through any agreement with our stockholders with respect to any shares of class C (series II) common stock or class EU (series II) common stock issued to Visa Europe pursuant to the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights.
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that, except with respect to shares of our regional classes of common stock and any shares of class B common stock or class C common stock into which shares of our regional classes of common stock may be converted under certain circumstances, we will not issue any fractional shares of any class of common stock upon conversion of any shares of any other class of common stock into shares of such class. In lieu of fractional shares, we will pay cash equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the fair market value, as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by our board of directors, per share of the applicable class of common stock into which such shares are being converted, as of the conversion date.
Amendments to Section 4.12.
The amendments to Section 4.12, if approved by our stockholders, would implement this determination and would apply the limitation on fractional shares to redemption of any shares of our common stock (in addition to conversion of any shares of our common stock, as more fully described in the immediately preceding sentence). Accordingly, redemption of any shares of our common stock will not result in issuance of fractional shares of any class of our common stock, and in lieu of fractional shares, we will pay cash equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the fair market value, as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by our board of directors, per share of the applicable class of common stock from which such shares are being redeemed on the applicable redemption date.
The full text of the proposed amended version of Section 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation, marked to show all changes from those sections as currently in effect, is attached as
Appendix A
to this proxy statement.
The proposed amendments to Section 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation would eliminate the issuance of fractional shares in connection with redemption of any shares of our common stock. Our board of directors, after consulting with our financial advisors, has determined that the administrative burden and cost to us of issuing and maintaining records with respect to small fractions of shares of our common stock after our proposed initial public offering outweighs any benefits achievable for us or our stockholders from the continued issuance of fractional shares and, accordingly, has determined to redeem for cash any fractional shares resulting from the redemption of shares of our common stock contemplated in connection with our proposed initial public offering. Such elimination of fractional shares will also enable the transfer agent to more efficiently administer the transfer or redemption of such shares of our common stock.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.12.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of all regional classes of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, is required to approve this proposal to amend Sections 4.1 and 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation. If approved, this proposal will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which we intend to do promptly upon obtaining stockholder approval.

Question
Why are we proposing to amend our certificate of incorporation?
Our certificate of incorporation requires us to redeem shares of our class B common stock and class C common stock (other than class C (series II) common stock) from the holders of those shares using net proceeds of our initial public offering, if and when that initial public offering occurs. Currently our certificate of incorporation requires that this redemption occur in a single tranche and this requirement creates a risk of delay in effecting that redemption due to a need to ascertain that we have collected all proceeds of our initial public offering and accounted for all expenses. We believe that our stockholders wish to have greater certainty about the ability to quickly effect the redemptions required to be completed out of the net proceeds of our initial public offering as quickly as possible after the completion of our initial public offering. The amendments we are proposing will create greater certainty that the a redemption of a all or a substantial portion of the required shares will occur promptly after shares of our capital stock are first sold in our initial public offering.
Answer:

Question
Will the proposed amendments change the number of shares that I will have redeemed or the amount of proceeds I will receive?
No. The amendments will not change the number of shares you have redeemed or the amount you will receive. The amendments merely increase the likelihood that you will receive a portion of your redemption more quickly than you would otherwise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect.
Answer:

Question
Will any stockholder's redemption proceeds or number of shares redeemed change pursuant to these amendments?
No. The amendments will not change the distribution of proceeds among stockholders or the aggregate number of shares to be redeemed from any stockholder. The amendments merely increase the likelihood that you will receive a portion of your redemption more quickly than you would otherwise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect.

PROPOSAL 1: AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 4.18 OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND CERTAIN RELATED PROVISIONS
On February 20, 2008, our board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to our stockholders for approval, amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and certain related provisions.
General.
In October 2007, we consummated a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to this reorganization, the global Visa enterprise included four major separately incorporated entities: Visa U.S.A., Inc. (which we refer to as Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (which we refer to as Visa International), Visa Canada Association (which we refer to as Visa Canada) and Visa Europe Limited (which we refer to as Visa Europe). Through our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became our subsidiaries. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc. at the time of the reorganization, but exchanged its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., for a minority shareholding in our common stock and other consideration. In connection with our reorganization we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation.
Background to Amendments to Section 4.18 and Related Provisions.
On November 9, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC) relating to a proposed initial public offering of our class A common stock (which we refer to as our "IPO"). We filed amendments to our registration statement with the SEC on December 21, 2007, on February 4, 2008 and, again, on February 11, 2008. Such registration statement has yet to become effective.
Our certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect provides that we will use a portion of the proceeds of our IPO, if and when it occurs, to redeem shares of our class B common stock and class C common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides for such redemption to be completed in a single tranche, using the net proceeds of our IPO (including the proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters with respect to our IPO). As currently set forth in our certificate of incorporation and assuming that the underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO contains a customary underwriters' overallotment option running thirty days from the date of the underwriting agreement, there exists a risk that such redemption (other than the redemption of shares of class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock and Class C (series IV) common stock held by Visa Europe Limited, the redemption of which is deferred in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation) would be required to be deferred until we were certain as to whether the underwriters overallotment option had been exercised. This resulted in uncertainty as to the timing of the redemption resulting from the possibility that we would have to wait approximately thirty days to determine the final result of the underwriters' overallotment option. The proposed amendments are intended to reduce or eliminate this uncertainty by allowing us to redeem a portion of the shares required to be redeemed promptly after the first sale of shares in connection with our IPO. Stockholders should note that no assurances can be given as to if, or when, we will consummate an IPO and we may never do so.
Our management recommended to our board of directors that it consider reducing the uncertainty inherent in our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect by amending section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and certain related provisions to permit the redemption contemplated by the certificate of incorporation to be completed in two tranches. On February 20, 2008, after due and careful deliberation and consultation with its legal and financial advisors, the board of directors passed resolutions to approve and adopt the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in the form attached hereto in setting forth amendments to section 4.18 and certain related provisions, and determined such amendments to be advisable and in the best interest of our stockholders and recommended that the stockholders adopt the amendments. Our officers of were thereby directed to submit the amendments to the certificate of incorporation to a vote of our stockholders at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders to be held on March 7, 2008.
Appendix A
 
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that after the completion of our IPO, we will redeem from the holders of class B common stock and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock, and other than any holders of common stock that is one of our subsidiaries) in a single tranche, a number of Shares of our Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock. The number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock to be redeemed is determined by a formula set forth in section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation, as in effect today. This formula takes the net proceeds which we receive from the sale of shares of our class A common stock in our IPO (including the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters with respect to our IPO) and reduces such net proceeds by (i) the amount which we elect to reserve out of such proceeds for general corporate purposes, (ii) the amount which the litigation committee established pursuant to our retrospective responsibility plan that we will place in escrow to meet our potential obligations in respect of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and (iii) a fixed amount of $1,146,000,000.00 which we intend to use in connection with the future redemption of our class C (series II) common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation. The formula allocates the resulting amount among the holders of class B common stock and class C common stock in a manner that reduces the redemption proceeds allocated to the holders of the class B common stock by the escrow amount.
Amendments to Section 4.18 and to certain related provisions.
The amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and to various related provisions of our certificate of incorporation, if approved by our stockholders, would have the effect of permitting us to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two separate tranches as opposed to the single tranche currently required. This would eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing of the redemption by allowing us to deliver a substantial portion of the mandatory redemption proceeds to our stockholders promptly after we first sell shares of our class A common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result of the amendments, we would no longer be required to wait to effect the redemption until we had received the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO or until such underwriters' overallotment option had expired.
It is important to note that the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation would change the overall amount of net proceeds that will be used to redeem shares of class B common stock or class C common stock, the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock to be redeemed or the allocation of those net proceeds or shares to be redeemed among our stockholders. Further, the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation would change or otherwise affect the timing of the redemption of any shares of class C common stock (of any series) held by Visa Europe Limited or Visa Europe Services Inc., which redemption is scheduled to occur no earlier than approximately 369 days after the consummation of our reorganization.
NOT
NOT
The other proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation are required to give effect to the proposed ability to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two tranches. We have modified several definitions in section 11.2 of our certificate of incorporation to give effect to the changes to section 4.18 (including definitions of "Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "Class B Percentage"; and "Class C Percentage"). Additionally, the following defined terms have been added to the certificate of incorporation: "Class B Redemption Shares"; "Class C Redemption Shares"; "Final Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "Final IPO Date"; "Initial Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "IPO Date"; and "Redemption Shares". In particular, note that we have modified the definition of "Applicable Conversion Rate" to reflect the fact that the adjustment to the conversion rate contemplated thereby would be made in two separate steps, giving effect to the two tranche redemption. The modifications to this definition allow the applicable conversion rate to be calculated at any time based on the number of shares actually redeemed at that time. In addition, we have made ministerial changes to certain other sections of our certificate of incorporation which are intended to preserve the original intent of the provisions.
The full text of all of the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation, marked to show changes from the certificate of incorporation currently in effect is attached as to this proxy statement.
Appendix A
 
Pursuant to the proposed amendments, within four (4) business days after the IPO date, we will be required to determine the initial aggregate redemption amount (the first tranche of the redemption) and within five (5) business days after the final IPO date, we will be required to determine the final aggregate redemption amount (the second tranche of the mandatory redemption). By "IPO" date we mean the date on which sales of Class A Common Stock in the IPO are first consummated. The "final IPO date" will be the earlier of (i) the date on which the underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters of the IPO expires and (ii) the date on which such underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full.
Pursuant to the proposed amendments, within five (5) business days of the IPO date, we will be required deliver to each holder of class B common stock and to each holder of class C common stock (in each case, other than the class C (series II) common stock and other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), a first tranche redemption notice setting forth (i) the initial aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the escrow amount, (iii) the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock), as applicable to be redeemed by us from such holder pursuant to such first tranche redemption notice, (iv) the date on which such redemption is to occur, which will be a date not later than ten (10) business days after the date on which the first tranche redemption notice is delivered and (v) if applicable, the place where the certificates representing such shares will be required to be surrendered for payment of the applicable redemption price.
By the "initial aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) the net proceeds we receive from, or as a result of, the sale of shares of class A common stock in, the IPO on the IPO date (to be determined net of expenses and discounts and commissions paid or incurred through and including the IPO date), (ii) at our option, an amount we reasonably determine does not exceed the net proceeds we receive from, or as a result of, the sale of shares of class A common stock in the IPO after the IPO date and prior to or on the business day that immediately precedes the date on which the first tranche redemption notice is first sent, pursuant to, or as a result of the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement with the several underwriters with respect to the IPO, (iii) an amount reasonably determined by the our board (or a committee thereof delegated such authority) to be an appropriate amount of funds for us to retain for general corporate purposes and (iv) the escrow amount and (v) an amount equal to U.S.$1,146,000,000.00.

On the first tranche redemption date, we will be required to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus ratably from the holders of class B common stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) an aggregate number of shares of class B common stock, known as the class B first tranche redemption shares, equal to ((X) the sum of ((I) the initial aggregate redemption amount and (II) the escrow amount), multiplied by the percentage (which we call the "class B percentage") of the aggregate shares of outstanding class B Common Stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) represented by shares of class B common stock immediately after the IPO date, minus (Y) the escrow amount) and divided by (Z) the price of the one share of class A common stock (net of discounts and commissions) in the IPO (which we refer to as the "IPO price"); and we will be required to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus ratably from the holders of class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) an aggregate number of shares of class C common stock, known as the class C first tranche redemption shares, equal to (X) the sum of ((I) the initial aggregate redemption amount and (II) the escrow amount) multiplied by (Y) the percentage (which we call the "class C percentage") of the aggregate shares of outstanding class B Common Stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) represented by shares of class C common stock, divided by (Z) the IPO price; provided, that the ratable portion of the class C (series III) common stock and the class C (series IV) common stock so redeemed shall be determined by treating the class C (series III) common stock and class C (series IV) common stock as a single series for such purpose and redeeming from the holders of such series of class C common stock, first, a number of shares of class C (series III) common stock equal to the lesser of (x) an amount equal to the number of class C
 
first tranche redemption shares attributable to such series and (y) all outstanding shares of class C (series III) common stock, ratably from such holders and, second, to the extent necessary, an amount of shares of class C (series IV) common stock which, when aggregated with the shares of class C (series III) common stock previously redeemed, equals the class C first tranche redemption shares attributable to such series, ratably from such holders.
If there are additional aggregate redemption proceeds available after the first tranche of the redemption is made, the amendments further provide that promptly, and in any event within ten (10) business days after the final IPO date, we will deliver to each holder of class B common stock and to each holder of class C common stock (in each case, other than the class C (series II) common stock and other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), at their respective addresses shown in the stock register, a final tranche redemption notice, setting forth: the (i) final aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock), as applicable, to be redeemed by us from such holder pursuant to such final tranche redemption notice, (iii) the date on which such redemption is to occur, which shall be a date not later than fifteen (15) business days after the date on which the final tranche redemption notice is delivered, and (iv) if applicable, the place where certificates representing such shares of class B common stock or class C common stock, as applicable, are to be surrendered for payment of the applicable redemption price.
By the "final aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the amount we actually use to redeem shares of our capital stock in the first tranche of the redemption; and by the "aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) the net proceeds we receive from the IPO (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any net proceeds received from the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters in respect of the IPO), (ii) an amount reasonably determined by our board (or a committee thereof delegated such authority) to be an appropriate amount of funds for us to retained for general corporate purposes and (iii) the escrow amount and (iv) an amount equal to U.S.$1,146,000,000.00.

The amendments will require us to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus: from the holders of class B common stock (other than any other common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), and each such holder shall be required to surrender to us ratably, an aggregate number of shares of class B common stock, known as the class B final tranche redemption shares equal to (X) the final aggregate redemption amount, multiplied by the (Y) class B percentage, and divided by (Z) the IPO price; and from the holders of class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) and each such holder shall be required to surrender to us ratably, an aggregate number of shares of class C common stock, known as the class C final tranche redemption shares, equal to (X) the final aggregate redemption amount, multiplied by (Y) the class C percentage divided by (Z) the IPO price; provided that the ratable portion of the class C (series III) common stock and the class C (series IV) common stock so redeemed shall be determined by treating the class C (series III) common stock and class C (series IV) common stock as a single series for such purpose and redeeming from the holders of such series of class C common stock, first, a number of shares of class C (series III) common stock equal to the lesser of (x) an amount equal to the number of class C final tranche redemption shares attributable to such series and (y) all outstanding shares of class C (series III) common stock, ratably from such holders and second, to the extent necessary, an amount of shares of class C (series IV) common stock which, when aggregated with the class C (series III) common stock previously redeemed, equals the class C final tranche redemption shares attributable to such series, ratably from such holders.

Appendix A
The amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and to various related provisions of our certificate of incorporation, if approved by our stockholders, would have the effect of permitting us to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two separate tranches as opposed to the single tranche currently required. This would eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing of the redemption by allowing us to deliver a substantial portion of the mandatory redemption proceeds to our stockholders promptly after we first sell shares of our class A common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result of the amendments, we would no longer be required to wait to effect the redemption until we had received the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO or until such underwriters' overallotment option had expired. We believe that our stockholders would prefer that, to the extent possible, we eliminate the uncertainty with respect to the timing of the redemption required by section 4.19 of our certificate of incorporation.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.18 and Other Related Provisions.
We believe that the proposed amendments are responsive to the needs and desires of our stockholders, each of whom is also a customer and, as such, we believe that effecting the proposed amendments will result in more satisfied customers.
The proposed amendments also benefit the corporation in that they reduce the time period during which we will have to retain the net cash proceeds of the IPO and manage the investment of cash. This will reduce administrative burden and require us to suffer the risk associated with such cash management activities for a shorter period of time.
We also believe that the distribution as promptly as practical of that portion of the net proceeds of our IPO intended to fund the mandatory redemption required by our certificate of incorporation is consistent with the spirit and intent of our reorganization.
The proposed amendments increase the certainty of that all or a portion of the redemption required by our certificate of incorporation will occur promptly after the date on which we first receive net proceeds of the our IPO, thus allowing our stockholders to better plan their financial affairs and assess the impact on them of our IPO, if and when it occurs.
The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and the other related provisions.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for our fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2008. GAAP net income for the quarter was $314 million, or $0.39 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 778 million. On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation, restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $401 million, or $0.52 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
San Francisco, CA, April 28, 2008
Net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter 2008 was $1.5 billion. Strong contributions were made by service fees, data processing fees, and international transaction fees as payment volumes and processed transactions rose across all regions worldwide.
"We are very pleased with our financial results for our first quarter as a public company. Despite a challenging economic environment, Visa recorded strong growth in payments volume and transactions globally and across our diverse suite of products  a trend which is continuing into the fiscal third quarter," said Joseph Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our performance is a testament to Visa's business model and economic resiliency, as we continue to lead the migration from cash and checks to electronic payments."
"Visa is focused on growing our business globally by extending our industry-leading processing services, expanding our products to new geographies, and further strengthening our valuable relationships with financial institutions and merchants who are critical to our success," said Mr. Saunders.
Fiscal Second Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc. reports operational performance data on a trailing one quarter basis, based on information provided to the company from client financial institutions. This operational performance data, which includes payments volume for our clients, total volume, total payments transactions, and total cards carrying Visa brands, are in part the basis for financial results in the following quarter. For the period ending December 31, 2007, which impacts the March 2008 fiscal quarter, Visa's operational performance highlights include:
 
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which are based on current fiscal second quarter results on Visa's processing system, were 8.8 billion, a 15% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal second quarter 2008, service fees were $792 million, up 29% over the prior year on a pro forma basis, and were recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other fee categories are recognized based on current quarter activity and are also compared on a pro forma basis. Data processing fees rose 34% over the prior year to $494 million. International transaction fees, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 35% over the prior year to $379 million, as we continued to benefit from higher multi-currency payments volumes across all regions during the fiscal second quarter. Other revenue, which includes the Visa Europe licensing fee, was $126 million for the fiscal second quarter. Volume and incentive payments, which are contra revenue, were $338 million for the fiscal second quarter.
Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter, up 39% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. The increase in total operating expenses over the prior year was primarily driven by a
 
$285 million provision for covered litigation. This amount is expected to be fully covered for Visa Inc. under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan. Excluding this provision, operating expenses grew only 3% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $8 billion at March 31, 2008, and includes $2.7 billion that we intend to use to redeem all of the series II and a portion of the series III class C shares in October 2008.
Other items for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008, included:
 
 
The Company's net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Management believes the presentation of adjusted operating income and adjusted net income provides a clearer understanding of the one-time items related to the Company's reorganization and initial public offering. These measures also adjust for expenses related to covered litigation that will be funded by the litigation escrow account through the retrospective responsibility plan. These items have a significant impact on our financial results but are either non-recurring or have no operating cash impact. Recognizing that we have a very complex equity structure incorporating multiple classes and series of common stock, the Company has also presented adjusted diluted class A earnings per share calculated based on adjusted net income and the adjusted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the periods presented. This non-GAAP financial measure has been presented to illustrate our per share results reflecting our capital structure after the redemption of all class C (series II) common stock and a portion of class C (series III) common stock, which the Company intends to redeem in October 2008. The class C (series II) common stock is classified as temporary equity and the class C (series III) common stock is classified as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2008. Management believes this non-GAAP presentation provides the reader with a clearer understanding of our per share results by excluding those shares to be redeemed and allocating adjusted net income only to classes and series of common stock classified as permanent equity.
Fiscal Year-to-Date 2008 Results:
For the six months ended March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. reported GAAP net income of $738 million, or $0.93 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 762 million.
On an adjusted basis, (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation, restructuring, and purchase amortization) net income for the six months ended March 31, 2008, was $844 million, or $1.08 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
Net operating revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2008, was $2.9 billion, up 24% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion for the six months ended March 31, 2008, up 21% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. The increase in total operating expenses over the prior year was primarily driven by a $285 million provision for covered litigation. This amount is expected to be fully covered for Visa Inc. under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan. Excluding this provision, operating expenses grew only 3% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc.'s financial outlook over the next three years includes the following metrics:
 
 
 
 
This outlook reflects an assumed 41% percent GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2008. Our intent is to reduce this rate to a level around 35-36% over the next five years.

 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for our fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2008. GAAP net income for the quarter was $314 million, or $0.39 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 778 million. On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation, restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $401 million, or $0.52 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
San Francisco, CA, April 28, 2008
Net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter 2008 was $1.5 billion. Strong contributions were made by service fees, data processing fees, and international transaction fees as payment volumes and processed transactions rose across all regions worldwide.
"We are very pleased with our financial results for our first quarter as a public company. Despite a challenging economic environment, Visa recorded strong growth in payments volume and transactions globally and across our diverse suite of products  a trend which is continuing into the fiscal third quarter," said Joseph Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our performance is a testament to Visa's business model and economic resiliency, as we continue to lead the migration from cash and checks to electronic payments."
"Visa is focused on growing our business globally by extending our industry-leading processing services, expanding our products to new geographies, and further strengthening our valuable relationships with financial institutions and merchants who are critical to our success," said Mr. Saunders.
Fiscal Second Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc. reports operational performance data on a trailing one quarter basis, based on information provided to the company from client financial institutions. This operational performance data, which includes payments volume for our clients, total volume, total payments transactions, and total cards carrying Visa brands, are in part the basis for financial results in the following quarter. For the period ending December 31, 2007, which impacts the March 2008 fiscal quarter, Visa's operational performance highlights include:
 
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which are based on current fiscal second quarter results on Visa's processing system, were 8.8 billion, a 15% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal second quarter 2008, service fees were $792 million, up 29% over the prior year on a pro forma basis, and were recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other fee categories are recognized based on current quarter activity and are also compared on a pro forma basis. Data processing fees rose 34% over the prior year to $494 million. International transaction fees, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 35% over the prior year to $379 million, as we continued to benefit from higher multi-currency payments volumes across all regions during the fiscal second quarter. Other revenue, which includes the Visa Europe licensing fee, was $126 million for the fiscal second quarter. Volume and incentive payments, which are contra revenue, were $338 million for the fiscal second quarter.
Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter, up 39% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. The increase in total operating expenses over the prior year was primarily driven by a
 
$285 million provision for covered litigation. This amount is expected to be fully covered for Visa Inc. under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan. Excluding this provision, operating expenses grew only 3% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $8 billion at March 31, 2008, and includes $2.7 billion that we intend to use to redeem all of the series II and a portion of the series III class C shares in October 2008.
Other items for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008, included:
 
 
The Company's net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Management believes the presentation of adjusted operating income and adjusted net income provides a clearer understanding of the one-time items related to the Company's reorganization and initial public offering. These measures also adjust for expenses related to covered litigation that will be funded by the litigation escrow account through the retrospective responsibility plan. These items have a significant impact on our financial results but are either non-recurring or have no operating cash impact. Recognizing that we have a very complex equity structure incorporating multiple classes and series of common stock, the Company has also presented adjusted diluted class A earnings per share calculated based on adjusted net income and the adjusted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the periods presented. This non-GAAP financial measure has been presented to illustrate our per share results reflecting our capital structure after the redemption of all class C (series II) common stock and a portion of class C (series III) common stock, which the Company intends to redeem in October 2008. The class C (series II) common stock is classified as temporary equity and the class C (series III) common stock is classified as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2008. Management believes this non-GAAP presentation provides the reader with a clearer understanding of our per share results by excluding those shares to be redeemed and allocating adjusted net income only to classes and series of common stock classified as permanent equity.
Fiscal Year-to-Date 2008 Results:
For the six months ended March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. reported GAAP net income of $738 million, or $0.93 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 762 million.
On an adjusted basis, (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation, restructuring, and purchase amortization) net income for the six months ended March 31, 2008, was $844 million, or $1.08 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
Net operating revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2008, was $2.9 billion, up 24% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion for the six months ended March 31, 2008, up 21% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. The increase in total operating expenses over the prior year was primarily driven by a $285 million provision for covered litigation. This amount is expected to be fully covered for Visa Inc. under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan. Excluding this provision, operating expenses grew only 3% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc.'s financial outlook over the next three years includes the following metrics:
 
 
 
 
This outlook reflects an assumed 41% percent GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2008. Our intent is to reduce this rate to a level around 35-36% over the next five years.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2008. GAAP net income for the quarter was $422 million, or $0.51 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 776 million. On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding certain litigation, restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $457 million, or $0.59 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
San Francisco, CA, July 30, 2008
Net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter 2008 was $1.6 billion, driven by strong contributions from service fees, data processing fees, and international transaction fees as payment volumes and processed transactions rose across all regions worldwide.
"We are very pleased with our fiscal third quarter results as Visa continues to lead and benefit from the global migration to electronic payments while expanding our business worldwide," said Joe Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite a challenging economic environment in the United States and a softening in traditional credit card spending, the strength of Visa's debit business drove solid growth in the region. In Asia Pacific, Latin America, Canada and CEMEA, Visa achieved strong growth across its range of product offerings, reinforcing our position as the world's leading payments brand and network."
"The Company's strong financial performance and double-digit increases in payments volume and transactions in this current economic environment are further proof of the resiliency of our network business model," added Saunders. "As we look to the future, we remain committed to being the best partner for our financial institution and merchant clients by investing in innovations that deliver measureable returns to their businesses and value to consumers and merchants."
Fiscal Third Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights for the fiscal third quarter, as measured by March 31, 2008 statistical data, include:
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which are based on current fiscal third quarter results on Visa's processing system, were 9.5 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal third quarter 2008, service fees were $749 million, up 13% over the prior year on a pro forma basis, and were recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other fee categories are recognized based on current quarter activity and are also compared on a pro forma basis. Data processing fees rose 20% over the prior year on a pro forma basis to $539 million. International transaction fees, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 44% over the prior year on a pro forma basis to $449 million, as we continued to benefit from higher multi-currency payments volumes across all regions during the fiscal third quarter. Other revenue, which includes the Visa Europe licensing fee, was $150 million during the fiscal third quarter, up 26% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Volume and incentive payments, which are a contra revenue item, were $274 million for the fiscal third quarter.
Total operating expenses were $965 million for the fiscal third quarter, a 5% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $8.4 billion at June 30, 2008, and includes $2.7 billion that the Company intends to use to redeem all of the Company's class C (series II) and a portion of the class C (series III) shares in October 2008.
The Company's net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Management believes the presentation of adjusted operating income and adjusted net income provides a clearer understanding of the one-time items related to the Company's reorganization and initial public offering. These measures also adjust for expenses related to covered litigation that will be funded by the litigation escrow account through the retrospective responsibility plan and a $31 million after-tax charge taken in the third quarter related to non-recurring legacy litigation items. The third quarter charge is not funded by the litigation escrow account. These items have a significant impact on our financial results but are either non-recurring or have no operating cash impact. Recognizing that we have a very complex equity structure incorporating multiple classes and series of common stock, the Company has also presented adjusted diluted class A earnings per share calculated based on adjusted net income and the adjusted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the periods presented. This non-GAAP financial measure has been presented to illustrate our per share results reflecting our capital structure after the redemption of all class C (series II) common stock and a portion of class C (series III) common stock, which the Company intends to redeem in October 2008. The class C
 
(series II) common stock is classified as temporary equity and the class C (series III) common stock is classified as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2008. Management believes this non-GAAP presentation provides the reader with a clearer understanding of our per share results by excluding those shares to be redeemed and allocating adjusted net income only to classes and series of common stock classified as permanent equity.
Fiscal Year-to-Date 2008 Results:
For the nine months ended June 30, 2008, Visa Inc. reported GAAP net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.44 per diluted class A common share. GAAP diluted class A common shares outstanding were 767 million.
On an adjusted basis, (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation, restructuring, and purchase amortization) net income for the nine months ended June 30, 2008, was $1.3 billion, or $1.67 per diluted class A common share. Adjusted diluted class A common shares outstanding were 779 million.
Net operating revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2008, was $4.6 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Total operating expenses were $2.9 billion for the nine months ended June 30, 2008, an increase of 15% over the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc. raises its financial outlook for the following metric for FY 2008:
 
Visa Inc. raises its financial outlook for the following metric for FY 2009 and 2010:
 
Visa Inc. reaffirms its financial outlook for the following metrics through 2010:
 
 
 
This outlook reflects an assumed 41% percent GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2008. The Company's intent is to reduce this rate to a level around 35-36% over the next five years.

The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Certificate does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

In addition, immediately after the completion of the partial redemption of the Class C (Series III) Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate, each outstanding share of Class C (Series III) Common Stock and Class C (Series IV) Common Stock automatically and without further action converted into one share of Class C (Series I) Common Stock.

Without limiting the foregoing, such automatic conversion shall not apply to any shares of Class A Common Stock acquired or held by a Visa Member, a Similar Person or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with its brokerage, market making, custody, investment management or similar operations or acquired by any investment fund managed by a Visa Member, a Similar Person or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 4.12 . No fractional shares of any class of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of any shares of any other class of Common Stock into shares of such class or upon redemption of any shares of Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fractional amount the fair market value (as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by the Board in good faith and in its sole discretion) per share of the applicable class of Common Stock into which such shares are being converted, as of the conversion date or the applicable class of Common Stock from which such shares are being redeemed on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be. If more than one share of any class of Common Stock is being converted at one time by, or redeemed at one time from, the same holder, then the number of full shares issuable upon conversion will be calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock converted or redeemed, as applicable, by such holder at such time. For purposes of determining the fair market value of any share of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock (other than Class C (Series II) Common Stock) in any redemption governed by this Section 4.12 (and solely for such purpose), each share of Class B Common Stock and each share of each series of Class C Common Stock (other than the Class C (Series II) Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock based on the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the applicable redemption.
No Fractional Shares

The Corporation shall not reclassify, subdivide or combine any class of Common Stock without also reclassifying, subdividing or combining each other class of Common Stock on an equal per share basis.

Section 4.14 .
Adjustments to Conversion Rate
(a) If the Corporation (i) subdivides, reclassifies or splits any of its outstanding shares of any class or series of its Common Stock into a greater number of shares; (ii) combines or reclassifies any of its outstanding shares of any class or series of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iii) issues by reclassification of any class of its Common Stock any shares of any class of its Common Stock, then the Applicable Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such action for each share of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock then outstanding shall be adjusted by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such action by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of all classes of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such action (giving effect to the exercise of all then outstanding convertible securities) and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of all classes of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such action on the record date applicable to such action, if any (giving effect to the exercise of all then outstanding convertible securities). The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made or such subdivision, combination or reclassification is not effected, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Applicable Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date or effective date had not been so fixed.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2008 Earnings Results on Higher Global Volumes and Strength of U.S. Debit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2008. For the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2008, on an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding certain litigation reserves, restructuring charges and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $448 million, or $0.58 per diluted Class A common share. Adjusted diluted Class A common shares outstanding were 776 million. The Company's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per Class A common share are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 29, 2008
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net loss of $356 million, or $(0.45) per diluted Class A common share, inclusive of a FAS 5 litigation reserve of approximately $1.1 billion related to the previously announced settlement of the Discover litigation. Since this litigation is covered by the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Company's U.S. financial institution holders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the Plan.
Net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.7 billion, driven by strong contributions from service fees, data processing fees, and international transaction fees. Payments volume and processed transactions remained strong across all regions worldwide.
"Visa capped an historic fiscal 2008 with a strong fourth quarter. Despite increasing economic turbulence worldwide, Visa posted strong revenue and earnings gains while diligently taking steps to capitalize on the continuing secular trend toward electronic payments," said Joe Saunders. "Although no company is immune to the challenges of this economic environment, we believe Visa's network business model, the continuing secular shift to electronic payments and diversity across both products and geographies offer a degree of resilience to our organization."
"Visa's evolution from our credit roots into a multi-product payments company continues to benefit our business. Debit  which now represents more than 53% of Visa's payments transactions worldwide  is particularly important to our results in the current environment, as that product is rooted in everyday spend' behavior which has proven to be less susceptible to economic fluctuations and continues to grow."
"We remain intensely focused on helping our financial institution and retail clients through this difficult period, providing them with products and services that build deeper cardholder relationships and boost their own bottom line," added Saunders.
Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights for the fiscal fourth quarter, as measured by June 30, 2008 statistical data, include:
 
 
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which represent fiscal fourth quarter transactions processed by VisaNet, were 9.6 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter 2008, service fees were $788 million, up 8% over the prior year on a pro forma basis, and are recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other fee categories are recognized based on current quarter activity and are compared on a pro forma basis. Data processing fees rose 18% over the prior year on a pro forma basis to $548 million. International transaction fees, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 45% over the prior year on a pro forma basis to $512 million, as we continued to benefit from higher multi-currency payments volumes across all regions during the fiscal fourth quarter. Other revenue, which includes the Visa Europe licensing fee, was $160 million, up 20% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $299 million.
Adjusted operating expenses were $943 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, a 20% decrease from the prior year on a pro forma basis. Operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $2.2 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, a 44% decrease from the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $7.5 billion at September 30, 2008. This amount does not include short-term investments of approximately $953 million which are classified as short-term other assets.
Fiscal Year 2008 Results:
On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate and excluding litigation reserves, restructuring charges and purchase amortization), net income for the full-year ended September 30, 2008, was $1.7 billion, or $2.25 per diluted Class A common share. Adjusted diluted Class A common shares outstanding were 776 million.
Reported GAAP net income of $804 million, or $0.96 per diluted Class A common share, inclusive of a FAS 5 litigation reserve of $1.4 billion, which is covered under the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
Net operating revenue for the full-year was $6.3 billion, an increase of 21% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Currency fluctuations contributed 2% of the increase in net operating revenues for the full-year.
 
Adjusted operating expenses were $3.4 billion for the full-year, a 4% decrease from the prior year on a pro forma basis. Operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $5.0 billion for the full-year, a 20% decrease from the prior year on a pro forma basis.
Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 40% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008.
Management believes the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income provides a clearer understanding of the one-time items related to the Company's reorganization and initial public offering. These measures also adjust for expenses related to covered litigation that will be funded by the litigation escrow account through the Retrospective Responsibility Plan and a $19 million and $51 million after-tax charge taken in the fourth quarter and full-year 2008 related to non-recurring legacy litigation items that were not funded by the litigation escrow account. These items have a significant impact on our financial results but are either non-recurring or have no operating cash impact. Recognizing that we have a very complex equity structure incorporating multiple classes and series of common stock, the Company has also presented adjusted diluted Class A earnings per share calculated based on adjusted net income and the adjusted diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the periods presented.
Subsequent Events:
On October 10, 2008, as planned, the Company completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of its Class C (Series II) Common Stock and 35,263,585 shares of its Class C (Series III) Common Stock held by Visa Europe Limited. The net cash amount that the Company paid to Visa Europe Limited in connection with the redemption of all its outstanding shares of Class C (Series II) Common Stock and 35,263,585 shares of its Class C (Series III) Common Stock was $2.65 billion. As planned, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its March 2008 initial public offering to fund these redemptions. In addition, immediately after the completion of the partial redemption of the Class C (Series III) Common Stock, each outstanding share of Class C (Series III) Common Stock and Class C (Series IV) Common Stock automatically and without further action converted into one share of Class C (Series I) Common Stock.
 
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc. clarifies its financial outlook for the following metrics through 2010 with the caveat that revenue growth may be somewhat challenged in 2010 given the current economic environment in the U.S. and around the globe:

The preceding tables present Payments Volume, Cash Volume, Total Volume, the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Payments Volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and Cash Volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total Volume represents Payments Volume plus Cash Volume.

These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports period-over-period growth in Total Volume, Payments Volume and Cash Volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD").

The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made or such subdivision, combination or reclassification is not effected, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Applicable Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date or effective date had not been so fixed.

The Corporation shall keep with its records such notice and a certificate from the Corporation's Chief Financial Officer briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation by which the adjustment has been made. The Corporation shall either include such calculation in the notification provided pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, or if it does not so include it, the Corporation shall promptly furnish it without charge upon written request of a holder of record of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct, absent manifest error.
 
(c) After an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Rate for outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.14, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment pursuant this Section 4.14 shall cause an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Rate for outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock as so adjusted.

On December 22, 2008, Visa Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company had deposited $1.1 billion ("Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan (the "Plan") at the time of the Company's initial public offering to address potential liability in certain U.S. litigation matters. Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow its U.S. financial institutions, the sole holders of Class B shares, bear the expense via a reduction in their as-converted share count. The deposit of the Loss Funds was conducted in accordance with the Company's amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Charter"), as approved on December 16, 2008 by the Company's shareholders, which enabled the Company to have greater flexibility in funding the litigation escrow account. More information on the Plan and changes made to the Company's Charter are available in the Company's final prospectus, dated March 18, 2008 and the Company's proxy statement, dated November 14, 2008, at .
www.sec.gov
The deposit of the Loss Funds into the escrow account reduces the conversion ratio applicable to the Company's Class B common stock outstanding from 0.7143 per Class A share to 0.6296 per Class A share. On a converted basis, 245,513,385 shares of Class B common stock currently outstanding are equal to 154,566,658 shares of Class A common stock. The deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase of 20,800,824 Class A common stock equivalents from the Company's Class B shareholders. The amount per share represents the volume weighted average price of the Company's Class A common shares for the 15-day trading period December 1, 2008 to December 19, 2008.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Visa Inc. Funds Escrow Account
 
 
Transaction has the effect of a $1.1 billion Class B share repurchase
 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today reported that it has deposited $1.1 billion into the litigation escrow account previously established under the company's retrospective responsibility plan (the "Plan").
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, December 22, 2008
Under terms of the Plan, when Visa funds the litigation escrow its U.S. financial institutions, the sole holders of Class B shares, bear the expense via a reduction in their as-converted share count.
"This transaction not only adds the necessary funds to our litigation escrow, but effectively acts as a $1.1 billion Class B share repurchase program," said Joseph Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief executive officer. "It has always been our stated intent to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are obviously pleased that our strong financial position and excess cash flow allows us to do this."
The Plan was established at the time of Visa's initial public offering. It provides coverage and a payment mechanism for judgments or settlements in specific U.S. legal cases, protecting Visa and its Class A and Class C shareholders from any direct losses.
The deposit of the funds into the escrow account reduces the conversion ratio applicable to Visa's Class B common stock outstanding from 0.7143 per Class A share to 0.6296 per Class A share. On a converted basis, the 245,513,385 Class B shares currently outstanding are equal to 154,566,658 Class A shares of common stock.
The deposit of loss funds has the effect of a repurchase of 20,800,824 Class A common share equivalents from the Company's Class B shareholders. The amount per share represents the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's Class A common shares for the 15-day trading period December 1, 2008 to December 19, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal First Quarter 2009 Earnings Results and Reaffirms 2009 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the company's fiscal first quarter 2009 ended December 31, 2008. On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate, restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $599 million, or $0.78 per diluted class A common share. GAAP net income for the quarter was $574 million, or $0.74 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 772 million. The company's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per class A common share are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 4, 2009
Net operating revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2009 was $1.7 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories. Payments volume and processed transactions remained solid, in particular in the Asia Pacific (AP), Central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regions.
"We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter earnings results and our ability to deliver strong operating performance," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the increasingly challenging economy, processed transaction growth, the strength of debit, and the global diversity of our business continue to highlight the resilience of our business model."
"Even though we now foresee tougher economic trends in the second half of fiscal 2009 with resulting net revenue growth likely in the low single digits, we remain stead-fast in our ability to meet our 2009 EPS guidance," added Saunders. "Rationalizing our expense structure and further leveraging operational efficiencies within the organization remain priorities. These directives, coupled with providing innovative products and services along with the global expansion of our business, will further support our long-term success."
Fiscal First Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights for the fiscal first quarter, as measured by business activity through September 30, 2008, include:
 
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet through December 31, 2008, were 9.8 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal first quarter 2009, service revenues were $793 million, an increase of over 8% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $554 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 33% over the prior year to $505 million, as the company benefited from prior pricing initiatives. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $156 million, up 17% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $269 million.
Adjusted total operating expenses were $728 million for the fiscal first quarter, a 4% decrease from the prior year. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $773 million for the quarter, a 5% decrease from the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $5.6 billion at December 31, 2008.
 
Notable Events:
In October 2008, as planned, the company used $1.508 billion of net proceeds from its initial public offering (IPO) for the required redemption of 35,263,585 shares of class C (series III) common stock. Following the redemption, the remaining 27,499,203 shares of class C (series III) and class C (series IV) common stock outstanding automatically converted into shares of class C (series I) common stock on a one-to-one basis. The company also utilized net proceeds from the IPO to fund the redemption of all class C (series II) common stock. The redemption price of $1.146 billion was adjusted for dividends paid and related interest, resulting in a cash payment of $1.138 billion.
In December 2008, the company formed Visa Processing Services, Ltd. ("VPS"), a joint venture that enables us to offer comprehensive multi-currency and multi-language issuer processing services outside the US, in some of the fastest growing economies in the world such as Japan and India. VPS reflects Visa's strategic focus on growing our processing capabilities worldwide, expanding our global strength in debit, and furthering the migration to electronic payments.
On December 19, 2008, as planned, the company deposited $1.1 billion ("Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The deposit of the Loss Funds into the escrow account to fund the Discover settlement reduced the conversion ratio applicable to the company's class B common stock outstanding from 0.7143 per class A share to 0.6296 per class A share. The deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase of 20,800,824 class A common stock equivalents from the company's class B shareholders.
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc. updates its financial outlook for the following metric for full-year 2009:
 
Visa Inc. affirms its financial outlook for the following metrics through 2010 with the caveat that annual net revenue growth may be somewhat challenged in 2010 if the current economic environment in the U.S. and around the globe persists beyond 2009:
 
 
 
 
 
This outlook reflects an assumed 40% percent GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2009. The company's intent is to reduce this rate to a level around 35-36% over the next four years.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Results and Reaffirms 2009 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Guidance
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the company's fiscal second quarter 2009 ended March 31, 2009. On an adjusted basis (reflective of a normalized tax rate, restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $553 million, or $0.73 per diluted class A common share. GAAP net income for the quarter was $536 million, or $0.71 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 753 million. The company's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per class A common share are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 29, 2009
Net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter of 2009 was $1.6 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year, driven by contributions across all revenue categories. Though slightly negative in the U.S., payments volume continued to grow on a constant dollar basis in all other regions globally. Processed transactions continued to post solid growth globally.
"Despite the challenging economy, Visa continued to post strong operational and financial performance during our fiscal second quarter, and we remain confident in delivering our EPS guidance for FY 2009," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "While expense management and efficiency remain key priorities, we will continue to carefully right-size our pricing structure and further invest in our business with the intent of driving incremental growth and realizing operating advantages."
"The resiliency in our business reflects the strength of Visa's credit, debit, and prepaid products worldwide, which continue to benefit from the ongoing secular shift from cash and check to electronic forms of payments," added Saunders. "These diverse products, combined with further expansion of our processing capabilities worldwide, should continue to benefit our shareholders, clients, and cardholders in the future."
Fiscal Second Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights for the fiscal second quarter, as measured by business activity through December 31, 2008, include:
 
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet through March 31, 2009, totaled 9.4 billion, a 6% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal second quarter 2009, service revenues were $804 million, an increase of over 2% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payment volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 10% over the prior year to $544 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 18% over the prior year to $446 million, as the company benefited from previously enacted pricing initiatives. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $148 million, up 17% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $295 million, a decline of 13% over the prior year.
Adjusted total operating expenses were $745 million for the fiscal second quarter, a 5% decrease from the prior year's adjusted total operating expenses of $783 million. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $766 million for the quarter, a 31% decrease from the prior year's total operating expenses of $1.1 billion.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investment securities were $5.8 billion at March 31, 2009.
Notable Events:
On March 2, 2009, the company unveiled its first global advertising campaign, entitled "More people go with Visa," reflecting the company's evolution to a single, global company. The new campaign enables Visa to align its worldwide marketing under a single theme that highlights the superior value Visa delivers versus cash and checks  including more security, more control and more convenience.
Also in March, MoneyGram International, a leading provider of global payment services, and Visa announced plans to introduce Visa ReadyLink  Visa's prepaid load network  in MoneyGram's 40,000 agent locations across the United States, providing financially underserved consumers with more convenient options to add funds to their Visa reloadable prepaid cards. MoneyGram joins more than 8,000 participating Visa ReadyLink locations, further extending the convenience and security of reload services to Visa prepaid cardholders in more convenient, everyday shopping locations.
 
On April 23, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly divided in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on June 2, 2009 to all holders of record of Visa's class A, class B and class C common stock as of May 15, 2009.
Also in April, the Board of Directors approved a program in which class C stockholders may liquidate up to 30% of their class C shares between July 1 and September 30, 2009, subject to certain terms and conditions. The remaining class C shares will continue to be subject to the general transfer restrictions that expire on March 25, 2011 under Visa's certificate of incorporation. Class C shares sold under this program will automatically convert to class A shares, tradable in the public market. The release of the class C shares does not increase the number of outstanding shares of the company and there is no dilutive effect to the outstanding share count from these transactions.

Item 8.01
Other Events.
On June 30, 2009, Visa Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company has decided to deposit $700 million ("Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow, its U.S. financial institutions, the sole holders of Class B shares, bear a corresponding financial impact via a reduction in their as converted share count. As a result, the deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase by the Company of $700 million of Class A Common Stock on an as converted basis. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be conducted in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation currently in effect.
A copy of the press release issued on June 30, 2009 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.

Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow, its U.S. financial institutions, the sole holders of Class B shares, bear a corresponding financial impact via a reduction in their as converted share count. As a result, the deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase by the Company of $700 million of Class A Common Stock on an as converted basis. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be conducted in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation currently in effect.

On July 1, 2009, Visa Inc. ("Visa") issued a press release announcing that Visa International, its wholly-owned subsidiary, sold 136,478,372 shares of Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento ("VisaNet do Brasil"), in connection with VisaNet do Brasil's June IPO. Visa's proceeds from the sale, net of underwriter discounts and fees, are approximately US$1 billion based on current exchange rates. Of the $1 billion in proceeds, the Company will retain about half after applicable taxes. Visa will record a GAAP gain from the sale in the quarter ended June 30, 2009, net of tax, of approximately $235 million. The gain reflects Visa International's recorded book value of $535 million, which is comprised of a cash investment of $18 million made in April 2008 and $517 million recorded through GAAP purchase accounting treatment as part of Visa's reorganization in October 2007.
A copy of the press release issued on July 1, 2009 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
As previously announced, Visa has initiated a program to allow its class C stockholders to apply for an early termination of the transfer restrictions applicable to class C shares, for up to 30% of the class C shares held by each such stockholder as of July 1, 2009, subject to certain terms and conditions. The release of the transfer restrictions does not increase the number of Visa's outstanding shares and there is no dilutive effect to the outstanding share count from these transactions. The remaining class C shares will continue to be subject to the general transfer restrictions that expire on March 25, 2011 under Visa's Certificate of Incorporation. In order to participate in the program, class C stockholders will need to apply to Visa's transfer agent between July 1 and September 30, 2009. Instructions for participating in the program, including its terms and conditions, were made available to Visa's class C stockholders in June 2009, and are available at .

Visa Streamlines Management Structure
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 27, 2009  Joseph W. (Joe) Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), today announced that he is reorganizing the company's executive management team's responsibilities to heighten organizational effectiveness and increase the pace of Visa's global alignment.
"We've come a long way since October of 2007 when we merged five independent Visa operating regions, Visa International and its global payment processing subsidiary, Inovant, into one company called Visa Inc. and very successfully took the company public," said Saunders. "Since the IPO, we've expanded our core debit and credit business, reduced operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, and heightened our focus on product innovation. We have met or exceeded most of the financial goals we established at the IPO, and continue to meet or exceed all our current financial guidance. As a growing and constantly evolving company, we will continually assess our management team structure and refine it as necessary to ensure that we continue to deliver value to clients and shareholders."
In the new structure, the company's global sales, client service, marketing, product development and innovation functions will be consolidated, effective immediately, under the leadership of John M. Partridge, Chief Operating Officer. With these critical business units more closely aligned, Visa will achieve greater integration, operating efficiencies and increased speed to market in delivering new products to clients.
John C. (Hans) Morris will step down as President, Visa Inc. He will remain with the company until the end of the year in a different capacity working with Mr. Saunders and helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new structure. Morris joined the newly formed Visa Inc. in 2007 and played a central role in the company's successful IPO in 2008. Since then he has enhanced Visa's client-facing operations, assisting the company in adopting more rigorous customer-centric models required by public companies, led its coordination with Visa Europe and played a significant role with many of Visa's key client relationships.
"Hans played an important role as we created Visa Inc., executed the IPO and transitioned Visa to a high performing public company," said Mr. Saunders. "We benefitted from his energy, insight and counsel."

Visa Inc. Posts Solid Fiscal Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Results and Updates Longer-term Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter 2009 ended June 30, 2009. On an adjusted basis (reflective of restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $744 million, or $0.98 per diluted class A common share. Excluding the impact from the sale of the Company's equity interest in VisaNet do Brasil, adjusted quarterly net income was $507 million or $0.67 per diluted class A common share. GAAP net income for the quarter was $729 million, or $0.97 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 756 million. The Company's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per class A common share are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 29, 2009
Net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2009 was $1.6 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by contributions across all revenue categories. Though slightly negative in the U.S., payments volume continued to grow on a constant dollar basis in all other regions globally. Processed transactions continued to post solid growth globally.
"With little real improvement in the economic backdrop, Visa still posted solid operational and financial performance results during the fiscal third quarter," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "Throughout this challenging time, the resiliency of our debit products and our credit products overseas, continue to exemplify the resiliency and stability of our business model."
"While we cannot predict the specific timing of a global economic turnaround, we remain committed to doing our part in delivering balanced growth to our shareholders over the long term," added Saunders. "As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2009 year and beyond, we will remain focused on leveraging our inherent operating scale, maintaining strong financial performance and expense control."
Fiscal Third Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights for the fiscal third quarter, as measured by business activity through March 31, 2009, include:
 
 
 
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet through June 30, 2009, totaled 10.3 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal third quarter 2009, service revenues were $769 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 12% over the prior year to $605 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 2% over the prior year to $458 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $158 million, up 6% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $344 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year.
Adjusted total operating expenses were $804 million for the fiscal third quarter, a 9% decrease from the prior year's adjusted total operating expenses of $883 million. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $824 million for the quarter, a 15% decrease from the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investment securities were $6.1 billion at June 30, 2009.

On June 30, 2009, Visa Inc. entered into a strategic alliance with Monitise plc, a UK based firm, to facilitate the delivery of Visa mobile payments and related services to consumers around the world. Concurrent with the strategic alliance, Visa has agreed to make a minority equity investment in Monitise. Monitise is a recognized expert in mobile financial services that operates payments and mobile banking services for some of the world's leading financial institutions.
On July 1, 2009, Visa Inc. announced that Visa International, its wholly-owned subsidiary, sold 136,478,372 shares of Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento ("VisaNet do Brasil"), in connection with VisaNet do Brasil's June IPO. Visa's proceeds from the sale, net of underwriter discounts and fees, are approximately US$1 billion based on the then current exchange rates. Visa recorded a GAAP gain from the sale in the quarter ended June 30, 2009, net of tax, of $237 million. The gain reflects net proceeds received in July 2009, in excess of Visa International's recorded book value of $535 million.
 
As previously announced, Visa has initiated a program to allow its class C stockholders to apply (prior to September 30, 2009) for an early termination of the transfer restrictions applicable to class C shares, for up to 30% of the class C shares held by each such stockholder as of July 1, 2009, subject to certain terms and conditions. The remaining class C shares will continue to be subject to the general transfer restrictions that expire on March 25, 2011 under Visa's Certificate of Incorporation. Class C shares sold under this program will automatically convert to class A shares, tradable in the public market. The release of the class C shares does not increase the number of outstanding shares of the Company and there is no dilutive effect to the outstanding share count from these transactions.
On July 16, 2009, as planned, the Company deposited $700 million ("Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The deposit of the Loss Funds into the escrow account reduced the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock outstanding from 0.6296 per class A share to 0.5824 per class A share. The deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase of approximately 11.6 million class A common stock equivalents from the Company's class B shareholders.
On July 22, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly divided in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on September 1, 2009 to all holders of record of Visa's class A, class B and class C common stock as of August 14, 2009.
Financial Outlook:
Visa Inc. updates its financial outlook for the following metrics through 2010:

This outlook reflects an assumed 41% GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2009, which reflects the tax impact of the Company's sale of its equity interest in VisaNet do Brasil. The Company's intent is to reduce this rate to a level around 35-36% over the next four years.

These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports period-over-period growth in Total Volume, Payments Volume and Cash Volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD").

Inc. ("Visa"). Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Settlement Agreement (as defined below).
WHEREAS, Constantine Cannon LLP (formerly, Constantine & Partners) and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP (formerly, Hagens Berman), together serve as co-lead counsel ("Co-Lead Counsel") to the Plaintiffs in the In Re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation, No. 96-CV-5238 (JG/JO), a class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the "Court") against Visa; and
WHEREAS, the Plaintiffs and Visa filed with the Court an executed settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") on June 4, 2003, that the Court approved on December 19, 2003, and that became final on June 1, 2005, after the denial of or expiration of all time for appeals; and
WHEREAS, Visa is obligated under Section 3(a) of the Settlement Agreement to make four additional payments of $200 million each (the "Future Payments") into the Settlement Fund Account on or before the following dates: December 22, 2009, December 22, 2010, December 22, 2011, and December 22, 2012; and
WHEREAS, in connection with the Settlement Agreement, Co-Lead Counsel established the Visa Qualified Settlement Fund bearing Employer Identification Number 200065396 (the "Visa Qualified Settlement Fund"); and
WHEREAS, Sections 11.16 and 11.17 of the Amended Plan of Allocation submitted to the Court by Co-Lead Counsel on August 16, 2005, provides that Visa may request that Plaintiffs work with Visa to establish a mutually agreeable discount rate to apply to any prepayment(s) in the event that Visa desires to make one or more payments on an accelerated basis; and
WHEREAS, Visa and Co-Lead Counsel now desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence their mutual agreement and to specify the terms with respect to the prepayment by Visa of the Future Payments at a discount.
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1. . The parties hereby agree that Visa shall make a payment of $682,000,000 (the "Payment"), on the later of September 30, 2009 or the business day after the date upon which the Court enters an order approving this Agreement and Co-Lead Counsel's authority to enter into it (the "Payment Date"), into the existing Visa Qualified Settlement Fund account established pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which are incorporated herein. The Payment shall be in full satisfaction of all of Visa's remaining payment obligations to the Plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement upon Final Approval as defined in Section 4 below.
Payment
Section 2. . Except as provided in Section 4, upon making the Payment, Visa shall no longer be obligated to make the Future Payments.
Future Payments
Section 3. .

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Solid Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Earnings Results and Authorizes a $1 Billion Share Repurchase Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2009. For the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2009, on an adjusted basis (reflective of restructuring and purchase amortization), net income for the quarter was $552 million, or $0.74 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares was 747 million. The Company's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per class A common share are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 27, 2009
GAAP net income for the quarter was $514 million, or $0.69 per diluted class A common share.
Net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.9 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year's net operating revenue of $1.7 billion and driven primarily by strong contributions from data processing revenues as processed transactions grew 9%. Though slightly negative in the U.S. and Canada, payments volume continued to grow on a constant dollar basis in all other regions globally.
"Visa delivered another quarter and year of solid financial results during this challenging economic environment," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong returns are a reflection of consumers' continuing shift to electronic payments, the success of efficiency initiatives and importantly, continued support from our financial institution partners."
"As we enter our new fiscal year, we are beginning to see some very early signs of stabilization in our business," continued Saunders. "And, while we cannot predict the ultimate speed or size of any economic recovery, we are confident that Visa is well positioned for future growth based on the investments we continue to make in our processing infrastructure, products and brand."

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.

LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

Visa Inc. Posts Solid Fiscal First Quarter 2010 Earnings Results
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal first quarter 2010 ended December 31, 2009. GAAP net income for the quarter was $763 million, or $1.02 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 745 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 3, 2010
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2010 was $2.0 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories, in particular data processing revenues and international transaction revenues.
"By all measures, Visa's fiscal first quarter was a strong start to the new year, as we continued to execute well against our business plan," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa Inc. "We were able to capitalize on the secular trend to digital currency and grow revenues, as we expanded our payments network and processing capabilities to drive transaction growth through effective marketing programs. Even in the midst of the current economic environment, we remain fully committed to assisting our clients through these challenging times and returning excess cash to our shareholders."
Fiscal First Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:
Visa Inc.'s operational performance highlights as measured by business activity for the three months ended September 30, 2009, include:
 
 
Cross border volume growth, on a constant basis, was positive 2% for the three months ended December 31, 2009.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet for the three months ended December 31, 2009, totaled 10.9 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year.
 
For the fiscal first quarter 2010, service revenues were $827 million, an increase of 4% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 38% over the prior year to $765 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 9% over the prior year to $552 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $190 million, up 21% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $374 million, which represents 16% of gross revenue.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $743 million for the quarter, a 4% decrease primarily a result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers' litigation.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.0 billion at December 31, 2009.
Operational Performance Highlight for the Quarter Ended December:

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For the 3 months ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Visa Inc. to Acquire CyberSource to Accelerate eCommerce Growth
 
 
Strengthens Visa's Leadership in Global eCommerce by Expanding Online Payment, Fraud and Security Management Capabilities
Enables Visa to Offer New and Enhanced Online Fraud Prevention Services to Merchants, Financial Institutions and Consumers
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) ("Visa") and CyberSource Corporation (Nasdaq: CYBS) ("CyberSource") today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Visa to purchase CyberSource, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants at a price of $26.00 per share, or total consideration of approximately $2.0 billion to be paid with cash on hand.
San Francisco and Mountain View, CA  April 21, 2010
CyberSource is an established industry leader that plays a role in processing approximately 25 percent of all eCommerce dollars transacted in the United States. The company serves more than 295,000 merchants through its CyberSource and Authorize.Net branded solutions. CyberSource clients include British Airways, Home Depot, Facebook, Google and many small businesses.
The acquisition of CyberSource will result in a compelling combination whose assets and expertise are expected to drive long-term growth by:
 
 
 
 
These benefits will be realized by merchants and financial institutions alike. Together, Visa and CyberSource will help merchants increase revenue through global growth while minimizing monetary loss from fraud and provide them with fast and efficient connectivity to multiple payment networks, including Visa. For financial institutions acquirers, Visa will deliver added value by providing new business referrals from eCommerce merchants.
"Online commerce continues to grow rapidly, and this acquisition will enable Visa to offer new and enhanced services that will better meet the growing demand among merchants globally for robust, secure online payment processing capabilities which in turn will grow the entire eCommerce category," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and CEO of Visa Inc. "With CyberSource, we are adding a new suite of leading eCommerce capabilities and experience in addressing eCommerce merchant needs. And, as eCommerce increasingly migrates to mobile devices, we believe the combination of Visa and CyberSource technology and services will position Visa to lead in mobile eCommerce."
The two companies are a proven team, having partnered since 1999, and currently collaborate on risk models built into CyberSource's automated fraud management solutions.
"By joining forces with the world's foremost payments company, we will have the opportunity to utilize Visa's regional expertise and global presence to drive international adoption of CyberSource in key geographies," said Michael Walsh, President and CEO of CyberSource Corporation.
"We are excited to build on the existing relationship we have with Visa and extend the reach and capabilities of our eCommerce payment platform for small businesses and international brands around the world," said William S. McKiernan, Executive Chairman and Founder of CyberSource.
"The acquisition of CyberSource aligns with Visa's long-term strategic plan to identify and invest in opportunities today that will drive future growth and deliver enhanced value to Visa and our clients," said Saunders.
Visa expects this transaction to be approximately $0.04 to $0.05 dilutive to its fiscal fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share on a GAAP basis, due to acquisition-related amortization and one-time transaction costs. Visa expects this transaction to be slightly dilutive to its fiscal full-year 2011 earnings per share on a GAAP basis, primarily related to amortization of intangible assets.
CyberSource's President and CEO, Michael Walsh, will continue to oversee CyberSource's operations. CyberSource's Executive Chairman and Founder, William S. McKiernan, will join Visa as an Executive Advisor to assist in the integration of the two businesses.
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of CyberSource and required regulatory approvals. The transaction, which has been approved by the Visa and CyberSource boards of directors, does not require a Visa shareholder vote and is expected to close in Visa's fourth fiscal quarter of 2010.
Visa and CyberSource will host a conference call today at 5:30 a.m. Pacific time (8:30 a.m. Eastern time) to discuss the transaction. The dial-in information for the call is 888-790-4410 (within the United States) or 773-756-0127 (international). The conference passcode is GATEWAY. A replay of the call will be available until May 19 and can be accessed by dialing 800-925-4998 (within the United States) or 402-220-4330 (international). The live call and replay, along with supporting materials, can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of Visa's website at .

Exhibit 99.4
On April 21, 2010, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and CyberSource Corporation (Nasdaq: CYBS) announced a definitive agreement whereby Visa will purchase CyberSource at a price of $26.00 per share, or a total of approximately $2.0 billion to be paid with cash on hand.
 
CyberSource is an established industry leader in eCommerce payments and plays a role in processing approximately 25 percent of all eCommerce dollars transacted in the United States. Founded in 1994, CyberSource was one of the world's first payment gateways, connecting online merchants to payment networks, including Visa. Today, CyberSource offers a full-service payment management platform for eCommerce merchants, combining global payment connectivity and processing with fraud management and secure payment hosting. These capabilities help merchants increase revenue through global growth while minimizing monetary loss through fraud and provide them with fast and efficient connectivity to payment networks, including Visa. Services are provided through two solution brands, CyberSource (large business) and Authorize.Net (small business).
 
The acquisition of CyberSource is an important step in Visa's commitment to deliver an enhanced value proposition to merchants, financial institutions and consumers. The acquisition will result in a compelling combination whose assets and expertise are expected to drive long-term growth by:
 
 
 
 
 
 
For online transactions, CyberSource's technology performs payment routing and is similar to the card swipe machine found in the physical retail world. CyberSource manages the routing of transactions for online merchants, offers automated fraud management solutions, secures payment data storage services and provides a safe and secure connection to a multitude of payment networks, including Visa.
Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. It is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments. Visa provides transaction-based services to our financial institution and merchant customers through VisaNet, our secure, centralized and global processing platform.
 
The company serves more than 295,000 merchants through its CyberSource and Authorize.Net branded solutions. CyberSource clients include medium to large businesses such as British Airways, Home Depot, Facebook and Google, while its Authorize.Net solutions serve small businesses with $3 million or less in annual online sales.
 
There will be no disruption to service. Until the transaction is complete, Visa and CyberSource will continue to operate as two separate organizations. CyberSource will continue to provide its industry-leading electronic payment, risk management, and payment security solutions to online merchants large and small. Services will
 
not be restricted to Visa payment products. Upon close, CyberSource can draw on Visa's financial institution relationships and global presence to drive international expansion of CyberSource's products and services. Customers will ultimately benefit from a broader portfolio of products and services that a combined CyberSource/Visa entity can offer.
 
Visa recognizes that part of CyberSource's success is driven by its strong sales channel with 4,700 resellers and affiliates, and the company has no plans to make substantive changes to CyberSource's Authorize.Net solution, partner programs or operations.
 
The acquisition will accelerate the growth of the eCommerce category, thereby increasing the usage of Visa debit, prepaid and credit products for online purchases. CyberSource's enhanced fraud protection services ensure Visa's consumers safer, more efficient transactions from online merchants. Given that the majority of CyberSource's transactions are currently derived from the U.S., there is tremendous opportunity to expand its services globally, providing increased eCommerce revenue for Visa's clients.
 
CyberSource will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc. CyberSource President and CEO Michael Walsh will continue to oversee CyberSource's operations. CyberSource's Executive Chairman and Founder, William McKiernan, will join Visa as an Executive Advisor to assist in the integration of the two businesses. Visa has no plans to make any substantive changes to CyberSource's operations and intends to invest in CyberSource's business and its employees. We will only do what is required from a policy and process standpoint to integrate these two public companies.
 
Visa Europe is supportive of this acquisition. We anticipate no disruption in service to merchants located in, or transacting in, Europe.
 
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of CyberSource and required regulatory approvals. The transaction, which has been approved by the Visa and CyberSource boards of directors, does not require a Visa stockholder vote and is expected to close in Visa's fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. Until the transaction is complete, Visa and CyberSource will continue to operate as two separate organizations and it is business as usual.
 
Please contact your account executive with additional questions. Both Visa and CyberSource will be posting updates about the transaction as needed on their websites.

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Results
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal second quarter 2010 ended March 31, 2010. GAAP net income for the quarter was $713 million, or $0.96 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 742 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 28, 2010
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter of 2010 was $2.0 billion, an increase of 19% over the prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories, in particular data processing and international transaction revenues.
"Visa delivered strong financial performance during our fiscal second quarter and we remain confident in delivering our guidance for fiscal year 2010," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "Our performance was fueled by higher than expected payments volume growth. As I discussed at our recent Investor Day, we are increasingly optimistic that economic growth will gradually improve. At the same time, we remain diligent about how we manage our business and finances throughout the current economic environment."
"Visa's long term strategic goals and our ability to drive the migration to Visa products and services are based on our history of innovation and market responsiveness," added Saunders. "Our pending acquisition of CyberSource is the most recent example of the Company responding to market opportunities to fuel future growth. We remain focused on enhancing product offerings and providing new technologies to our clients and customers, while we continue to deliver value to our shareholders."
Fiscal Second Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis for the three months ended December 31, 2009 on which fiscal second quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 8% over the prior year at $769 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2010, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $745 billion.
 
Cross border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was positive 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2010.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 totaled 10.6 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal second quarter 2010, service revenues were $885 million, an increase of 10% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 34% over the prior year to $728 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 22% over the prior year to $545 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $372 million, which represents 16% of gross revenue.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $837 million for the quarter, a 9% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.3 billion at March 31, 2010.
Notable Events:
In October 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan through September 30, 2010, and is subject to change at the determination of Visa's Board of Directors. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our outstanding class A common stock at an average price of $83.61 per share in the open market for a total cost of $231 million. During the six months ended March 31, 2010, we repurchased 8.3 million shares of our outstanding class A common stock at an average price of $80.40 per share in the open market for a total cost of $664 million. At March 31, 2010, the share repurchase plan has remaining authorized funds of $336 million.
As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved the release of additional class C shares. The number of shares released for any class C shareholder was the greater of (a) 50% (fifty percent) of the restricted class C shares held by that shareholder as of March 1, 2010, and (b) 5,000 (five thousand) class C shares. Under this program, 56 million shares of class C common stock were released from transfer restrictions during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The release of the class C shares did not increase the number of outstanding shares on an as-converted basis, and there are no dilutive effects to the outstanding class A common stock share count on an as-converted basis from these transactions.
 
As previously announced, the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CyberSource Corporation ("CyberSource"), a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchant, at a price of $26 per share, or total consideration of approximately $2.0 billion to be paid with cash on hand. With the addition of CyberSource, Visa will offer merchants and financial institutions eCommerce solutions that include enhanced online payment processing capabilities, payment routing, fraud protection services and secure data hosting. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of CyberSource and required regulatory approvals. The transaction, which has been approved by the Visa and CyberSource boards of directors, does not require a Visa shareholder vote, and is expected to close in Visa's fourth fiscal quarter of 2010.

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For the 3 months ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

Other Events.
On May 20, 2010, Visa Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company had decided to deposit $500 million (the "Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow, its U.S. financial institutions and their affiliates and successors, the sole holders of Class B shares, bear a corresponding financial impact via a reduction in their as-converted share count. As a result, the deposit of Loss Funds has the effect of a repurchase by the Company of $500 million of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be conducted in accordance with the Company's certificate of incorporation currently in effect.
A copy of the press release issued on May 20, 2010, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.

Exhibit 99.4
 
On July 21, 2010, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) completed the acquisition of CyberSource Corporation at a price of $26.00 per share, or a total of approximately $2.0 billion, to be paid with cash on hand.
 
CyberSource is an established industry leader in eCommerce payments and plays a role in processing approximately 25 percent of all eCommerce dollars transacted in the United States. Founded in 1994, CyberSource was one of the world's first payment gateways, connecting online merchants to payment networks, including Visa. Today, CyberSource offers a full-service payment management platform for eCommerce merchants, combining global payment connectivity and processing with fraud management and secure payment hosting. These capabilities help merchants increase revenue through global growth while minimizing monetary loss through fraud and provide them with fast and efficient connectivity to payment networks, including Visa. Services are provided through two solution brands, CyberSource (large business) and Authorize.Net (small business).
 
The acquisition of CyberSource is an important step in Visa's commitment to deliver an enhanced value proposition to merchants, financial institutions and consumers. The acquisition will result in a compelling combination whose assets and expertise are expected to support long-term growth by:
 
 
 
 
 
 
For online transactions, CyberSource's technology performs payment routing and is similar to the card swipe machine found in the physical retail world. CyberSource manages the routing of transactions for online merchants, offers automated fraud management solutions, secures payment data storage services and provides a safe and secure connection to a multitude of payment networks, including Visa.
Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. It is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments. Visa provides transaction-based services to our financial institution and merchant customers through VisaNet, our secure, centralized and global processing platform.
 
The company serves more than 300,000 merchants through its CyberSource and Authorize.Net branded solutions. CyberSource clients include medium to large businesses such as British Airways, Gucci Group and Google, while its Authorize.Net solutions serve small businesses with $3 million or less in annual online sales.
 
There will be no disruption to service. CyberSource will continue to provide its industry-leading electronic payment, risk management, and payment security solutions to online merchants large and small. Services will not be restricted to Visa payment products. CyberSource will be able to utilize Visa's financial institution relationships and global presence to drive international expansion of CyberSource's products and services. Customers will ultimately benefit from a broader portfolio of products and services that a combined CyberSource/Visa entity can offer.
 
Visa recognizes that part of CyberSource's success is driven by its strong sales channel with 4,700 resellers and affiliates, and the company has no plans to make substantive changes to CyberSource's Authorize.Net solution, partner programs or operations.
 
The acquisition will accelerate Visa's growth in the eCommerce category, thereby increasing the usage of Visa debit, prepaid and credit products for online purchases. CyberSource's enhanced fraud protection services ensure Visa's consumers safer, more efficient transactions from online merchants. Given that the majority of CyberSource's transactions are currently derived from the U.S., there is tremendous opportunity to expand its services globally, providing increased eCommerce revenue for Visa's clients.
 
CyberSource will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc. CyberSource President and CEO Michael Walsh will continue to oversee CyberSource's operations. CyberSource's Executive Chairman and Founder, William McKiernan, will join Visa as an Executive Advisor to assist in the integration of the two businesses. Visa has no plans to make any substantive changes to CyberSource's operations and intends to invest in CyberSource's business and its employees.
 
Please contact your current account executive with additional questions.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Visa Inc. Moves to Declassify Board of Directors and to Adopt Majority Vote Standard for Election of Directors
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 22, 2010  Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced today that its board of directors unanimously voted in favor of two amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation: declassifying the board and adopting a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections. Approval of the amendments requires support by the majority of outstanding shares of the Company's class A common stock at the Company's next annual meeting, to be held on January 27, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting").
Declassification of the board will permit Visa's stockholders to vote annually for all directors. Currently, the Company's three classes of directors are elected for staggered three-year terms. If the stockholders approve the proposal to declassify the board, all directors will stand for election each year beginning with the 2011 Annual Meeting.
Under the majority vote standard approved by the board, each nominated director must receive more votes cast for his or her election than against to be elected. An incumbent director will be required to tender his or her resignation prior to the annual meeting, which will become effective if the director fails to receive a majority of "for" votes and the board accepts the resignation. This proposed amendment applies to director elections beginning in 2012. In the case of contested elections, directors will continue to be elected by a plurality vote.
"The decisions to declassify the board and adopt a majority vote standard are consistent with Visa's commitment to sound corporate governance," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Visa Inc. "The board believes these proactive steps to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation are in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders."
The Company also announced that the record date for the 2011 Annual Meeting is December 3, 2010. The Company's class A common stockholders at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the 2011 Annual Meeting.

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Results
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter 2010 ended June 30, 2010. GAAP net income for the quarter was $716 million, or $0.97 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was 738 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 28, 2010
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2010 was $2.0 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories, in particular data processing and international transaction revenues.
"Visa delivered a solid financial performance during our fiscal third quarter as we saw continued improvements in global cross border and payments volume growth," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "As we look to the remainder of our fiscal 2010 year, we remain focused on integrating our recent acquisition of CyberSource, maintaining strong financial performance and expense control discipline."
"It goes without saying, the United States debit market will undergo changes following implementation of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act next year," added Saunders. "While it is too early to fully and accurately gauge the impact of the legislation, Visa has demonstrated an ability to manage our business through periods of change. The global shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a powerful force that continues unabated, providing tangible benefits to consumers, merchants, and governments worldwide. I continue to have strong confidence in our prospects for long-term growth driven by Visa's highly resilient network business model, our continued investment in innovation and the expansion of our global reach."
Fiscal Third Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis for the three months ended March 31, 2010 on which fiscal third quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $745 billion.
 
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2010, was a positive 14% over the prior year at $803 billion.
Cross border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 17% for the three months ended June 30, 2010.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 totaled 11.7 billion, were a positive 14% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal third quarter 2010, service revenues were $873 million, an increase of 13% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 31% over the prior year to $792 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 25% over the prior year to $574 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $183 million, up 15% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $393 million, which represents 16% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $892 million for the quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $7.4 billion at June 30, 2010.
Notable Events:
On May 28, 2010, the Company deposited $500 million (the "Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The deposit of the Loss Funds into the escrow account reduced the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock from 0.5824 to 0.5550. On an as-converted basis, the deposit of Loss Funds had the effect of a repurchase of approximately 6.7 million shares of class A common stock from the Company's class B shareholders.
On July 21, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants, at a price of $26.00 per common share, or total consideration of approximately $2.0 billion paid with cash on hand. With the addition of CyberSource, Visa will offer merchants and financial institutions eCommerce solutions that include enhanced online payment processing capabilities, payment routing, fraud protection services and secure data hosting.
 
On July 22, 2010, the Company announced that the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders will be held on January 27, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"), with a record date of December 3, 2010. The Company's stockholders at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
In addition, the Company announced that its board of directors had unanimously voted to declassify the board and to submit a proposal at the Annual Meeting to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to eliminate the classification of the board of directors. The board of directors also unanimously voted to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and corporate governance guidelines to adopt a majority vote standard for uncontested elections of directors and to submit a proposal to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to allow for the adoption of the majority vote standard. The changes to the bylaws and corporate governance guidelines are contingent on stockholder approval of the amendments to the certificate of incorporation.
Also, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly divided in the aggregate amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on September 1, 2010, to all holders of record of Visa's class A, class B and class C common stock as of August 13, 2010.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD").

Entry into Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 4, 2010, Visa Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
Visa Settles with U.S. Department of Justice and Seven State Attorneys General
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 4, 2010  Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) announced today a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the attorneys general of seven states to resolve antitrust investigations into the company's merchant acceptance rules in the U.S. As part of the settlement, Visa will allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer customers to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to any card product, such as a "non-reward" Visa credit card.
Visa's rules always have allowed U.S. merchants to steer customers to other forms of payment and offer discounts to customers who choose to pay with cash, check or PIN debit. The new rules will expand U.S. merchants' ability to discount for their preferred form of payment, though they will not be able to pick and choose amongst issuing banks. The settlement agreement does not address Visa's rule prohibiting U.S. merchants from surcharging consumers.
"As we referenced in our previous public filings, our constructive conversations with the Department of Justice have resulted in an amicable resolution of the Department's broad-based investigation that will lead to Visa making a reasonable modification to our discounting rule," said Josh Floum, General Counsel, Visa Inc. "Visa always has allowed merchants to discount for cash and PIN-debit, and extending the ability to discount by network brand is a reasonable accommodation. The settlement will not impact our ability to continue growing our business by offering innovative payments products that consumers and merchants value above any others. The settlement also gives U.S. merchants new tools to manage their acceptance costs while benefitting from the tremendous value electronic payments deliver. "
There is no monetary obligation associated with the DOJ settlement. The investigation brought by the state attorneys general is resolved on the same terms, plus reimbursement of the attorneys' fees and expenses. MasterCard has agreed to enter into the same settlement and will change its relevant rules as well.
The DOJ issued a civil investigative demand to Visa in 2008, seeking information about certain Visa acceptance rules, including those related to surcharging and discounting. A working group of state attorneys general issued a similar civil investigative demand in 2009. Both investigations end today with a consent decree that sets forth the terms of the settlement, subject to court approval.
Visa will make formal rule changes after the court enters a final judgment following a public comment period, but will refrain from enforcing its current discounting rules in the interim. U.S. merchants will receive additional information about the settlement from their acquiring financial institution after the final judgment.
Visa Inc. is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable digital currency. Underpinning digital currency is one of the world's most advanced processing networksVisaNetthat is capable of handling more than 10,000 transactions a second, with fraud protection for consumers and guaranteed payment for merchants.

Under the terms of the Plan, the $800 million deposit has the effect of a repurchase by the Company of 10,997,507 shares of class A common stock at approximately $72.74 per share, on an as-converted basis, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count from 136,250,668 to 125,253,161.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2010 Earnings Results and Authorizes
New $1 Billion Share Repurchase Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2010. For the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2010, GAAP net income was $774 million, an increase of 51% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 54% over the prior year. On an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option), net income for the quarter was $695 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $0.95, an increase of 38% over the prior year.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 27, 2010
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.1 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories, in particular data processing and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards quarterly net operating revenues.
GAAP net income for the full-year was $3.0 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $4.01, an increase of 29% over the prior year. GAAP net operating revenue in the full-year was $8.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year and was driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards full-year net operating revenues.
On an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option), net income for the full-year was $2.9 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $3.91, an increase of 26% over the prior year. The Company's adjusted quarterly and full-year net income per class A common shares outstanding are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
Visa's results for both the fourth fiscal quarter and the full-year reflect the inclusion of CyberSource for the two months after its acquisition.
"We are very pleased with our fourth fiscal quarter and full-year earnings results as we continue to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives while in the midst of a very challenging business environment," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our continued focus, execution and resilience have enabled us to continue to generate solid returns and meaningful growth across our business, products and geographies."
"Looking ahead to our fiscal 2011, Visa will continue to invest in initiatives and investments to grow our core and emerging product portfolios globally, innovate into new payments channels and integrate our recent acquisition of CyberSource. We are committed to delivering solid business performance, supporting our financial clients and partners, and delivering above average shareholder returns."
Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis for the three months ended June 30, 2010 on which fiscal fourth quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 14% over the prior year at $802 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2010, was a positive 14% over the prior year at $828 billion.
Cross border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 16% for the three months ended September 30, 2010.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended September 30, 2010, totaled 12.1 billion and were a positive 16% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter 2010, service revenues were $912 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 15% over the prior year to $840 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 22% over the prior year to $619 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $167 million, up 3% over the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $421 million and represent 17% of gross revenues.
 
 
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $1 billion for the quarter, a less than 1% decline over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.0 billion at September 30, 2010.
Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 38% for quarter ended September 30, 2010, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option.

For the fiscal full-year, service revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Data processing revenues rose 29% over the prior year to $3.1 billion.

Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 37% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option.
Notable Events:
As previously disclosed, on October 4, 2010, Visa entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the attorneys general of seven states to resolve antitrust investigations into the Company's merchant acceptance rules in the U.S. The DOJ issued a civil investigative demand to Visa in 2008, seeking information about certain Visa acceptance rules, including those related to surcharging and discounting. Both investigations ended with a consent decree that sets forth the terms of the settlement, subject to court approval. There is no monetary obligation associated with the DOJ settlement.
 
 
On October 8, 2010, the Company deposited $800 million into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit into the escrow account reduced the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock from 0.5550 to 0.5102. On an as-converted basis, the deposit had the effect of a repurchase of approximately 11.0 million shares of class A common stock from the Company's class B shareholders.
On October 20, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 7, 2010, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of November 19, 2010. In addition, the Company announced it has successfully completed its $1 billion share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $72.29 per share. Under the full plan, a total of 12.9 million shares of class A common stock was repurchased at an average price of $77.48 per share.
Today, the Company announces that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion class A common stock repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2011, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of Visa's Board of Directors.

Forward Looking Statements:
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the terms "outlook," "will" and similar references to the future. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about revenue, incentive payments, expenses, operating margin, earnings per share, free cash flow, tax rate and capital expenditures and the growth of those items.
By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of future performance and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements because of a variety of factors, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the other factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" herein and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Adjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share
US$ in millions, except per share data
Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods. The revaluation of the Put option resulted in non-cash, non-operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2010. The reduction in value was primarily the result of declines in Visa's price-to-earnings ratio in the second half of fiscal 2010 and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. Management therefore believes that the resulting non-operating income is not indicative of Visa's performance in the current or future periods.
 
 
 
 
The tables below provide information regarding the available operational results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2010, as well as the prior four quarterly reporting periods and the 12 months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Included is a new table with information on the number of billable transactions processed on CyberSource's network. Visa Inc. completed its acquisition of CyberSource Corporation on July 21, 2010.
1. Branded Volume and Transactions
The tables present total volume, payments volume, and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For the 3 months ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.
 
Operational Performance Data
 
 
 
2. Cross Border Volume
The table below represents cross border volume growth for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Cross border volume refers to payments and cash volume where the issuing country is different from the merchant country.
 
3. Visa Processed Transactions
The table below represents transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS cards processed on Visa's networks. CyberSource transactions are not included in this table. CyberSource transactions are reported in the next section.

As described in the Definitive Proxy Statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 1, 2009, we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers including Messrs. Byron H. Pollitt; John M. Partridge; William M. Sheedy; and Joshua R. Floum (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers"). At the expiration of the initial three-year term (or anniversary thereof, if previously extended), all such employment agreements extend for an additional one-year period unless Visa or the Named Executive Officer gives prior written notice not to renew the employment agreements. A copy of our employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers, as amended, has been previously filed with the SEC.
On November 3, 2010, the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company approved an Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") in order to better reflect current compensation practices and trends by transitioning away from individual agreements with our Named Executive Officers (other than our Chief Executive Officer). The compensation committee designated the Named Executives Officers and other executive officers who are eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, subject to timely execution and return of a participation letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement"), which becomes effective on each Named Executive Officer's or other executive officers' Eligibility Date (as defined in the Severance Plan). Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, the Named Executive Officers and other executive officers will agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the Letter Agreement.
Visa has provided written notice of its election to not renew the term of the employment agreements currently in place with the Named Executive Officers. In said notice, each Named Executive Officer was informed that the date immediately following the expiration date of his employment agreement would be the "Eligibility Date" for purposes of determining whether such executive would be eligible as a Participant in the Severance Plan. One of the determining factors is whether the executive is an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries as of the Eligibility Date.
The Severance Plan includes a provision stating that once eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan, each executive shall remain a Participant in the Severance Plan until the amounts and benefits payable under the Severance Plan have been paid or provided to the Participant in full.
Under the Severance Plan, if a Participant's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the executive officer for "good reason" during the two-year period following a Change of Control that occurs after the Participant's Eligibility Date (as such terms are defined in the Severance Plan), the Participant will be eligible for the following payments and benefits:
 
 
 
 
 
In order to be entitled to severance payments and benefits, the Participant will be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the Letter Agreement, including, without limitation, to execute a release and waiver of all claims in favor of Visa and, in certain circumstances, comply with post-employment covenants to protect Visa's confidential information, not to solicit Visa's employees and not to disparage or otherwise impair Visa's reputation, goodwill or commercial interests or any of Visa's affiliated entities or its or their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products.
Visa retains the discretion to amend or terminate the Severance Plan. Any amendment to the Severance Plan that is materially adverse to any Participant requires such Participant's written consent. However, in the event the Severance Plan is terminated, the Participant will be bound by the terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement.
The foregoing description is not a complete description of the Severance Plan or the Letter Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Severance Plan and the form Letter Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02. Any capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Severance Plan or the Letter Agreement.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Limitation on Payments Under Certain Circumstances
(a) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Accounting Firm (as defined below) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Participant to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Plan (the "") so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below).

(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Plan Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 5 shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than fifteen (15) days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Plan Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only cash amounts payable under this Plan (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the cash payments (to the extent such amounts are considered Payments) under the following sections in the following order: (1) the Plan Payments under Section 4(b)(i)(III) and (2) any other cash Plan Payments that would be made upon a termination of the Participant's employment and that have a Parachute Value, beginning with the payments that would be made last in time. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan that should not have been so paid or distributed ("") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed (""), in each case consistent with the calculation of the Safe Harbor Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Participant that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Participant shall pay promptly (and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date on which the Overpayment is determined) any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal short-term rate in effect under Section 1274(d) of the Code compounded semiannually (""); , , that no amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. If the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date on which an Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant together with Interest.

Return of Company Property
 
connected with or derived from his services to the Company. The Participant agrees that the Company owns all work product, patents, copyrights and other material produced by the Participant during the Participant's employment with the Company.
(b) . The Participant shall not at any time, whether during the Participant's employment or following the termination of the Participant's employment, for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly, disclose or furnish to any entity, firm, corporation or person, except as otherwise required by law, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company with respect to any aspect of its operations, business or clients. "" shall mean information generally unknown to the public to which the Participant gains access by reason of the Participant's employment by the Company and includes, but is not limited to, information relating to all present or potential customers, business and marketing plans, sales, trading and financial data and strategies and operational costs.

While the Participant is employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except in the performance of his duties to the Company hereunder, and for eighteen months following the termination of the Participant's employment for any reason or no reason, the Participant shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employees of the Company to leave the Company or in any way modify their relationship with the Company; (ii) encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company or in the modification of any such employee's relationship with the Company, or cause others to participate, encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company; or (iii) solicit the trade or patronage of any clients or customers or any prospective clients or customers of the Company.
Nonsolicitation
(d) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purposes of the foregoing covenants are to protect the goodwill and confidential or proprietary information of the Company and to prevent the Participant from interfering with the business of the Company as a result of or following termination of the Participant's employment with the Company; (ii) because of the nature of the business in which the Company and its affiliates are engaged and because of the nature of the confidential and proprietary information to which the Participant has access, it would be impractical and excessively difficult to determine the actual damages to the Company if the Participant breached any of the covenants of this Section 7; (iii) remedies at law (such as monetary damages) for any breach of the Participant's obligations under this Section 7 would be inadequate; and (iv) the terms of the covenants are sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and impose no undue hardship on the Participant. The Participant therefore agrees and consents that if he commits any breach of a covenant under this Section 7 or threatens to commit any such breach, the Company shall have the right (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of California, or in any state in which the Participant resides, without posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual damage. With respect to any provision of this Section 7 finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the Participant and the Company hereby agree that such court shall have jurisdiction to reform this Plan or any provision hereof so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the parties agree to abide by such court's determination. If any covenant of this Section 7 is determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such determination shall not be a bar to or in any way diminish the Company's rights to enforce any such covenant in any other jurisdiction. In no event may a breach or threatened breach of the covenants in this Section 7 constitute a basis for the Company to

As previously mentioned, beginning in fiscal year 2011, Visa Inc. (the "Company") changed its income statement presentation for non-Visa transaction pass-through revenues and expenses from a "gross" reporting basis to a "net" reporting basis. Previously, pass-through revenues were booked to data processing and related expenses were booked to the network, EDP and communications line item on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. This change in presentation does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset.
The following table represents the amounts related to non-Visa transactions recorded in data processing revenues and network, EDP and communications expenses on a quarterly basis in fiscal year 2010:
 
In addition, during fiscal year 2010, the Company began transitioning issuers to direct billing for the Visa Extras rewards platform, whereby an outside service provider bills the issuer directly for rewards and fulfillment services. Further, a large issuer converted away from the rewards platform in June 2010. As a result of these changes in contractual arrangements, $89 million of other revenues and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses recorded in the Company's fiscal year 2010 consolidated statement of operations will not recur in fiscal year 2011. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset.
The following table represents the amounts related to Visa Extras activity recorded in other revenues and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses on a quarterly basis in fiscal year 2010:

On December 1, 2010, Visa Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Joseph W. Saunders, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board (the "Agreement"). The Agreement supersedes the existing employment agreement dated February 7, 2008 between the Company and Mr. Saunders.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Saunders will (i) receive an annual base salary of not less than $950,000, (ii) be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment with a target of no less than 250% of his base salary and a maximum of no less than 500% of his base salary, (iii) be eligible to receive an annual long-term incentive award with a target value of no less than 500% of his base salary, (iv) be entitled to employee benefits and fringe benefits on a basis that is no less favorable than those provided to other executive officers of the Company and perquisites on a basis that is no less favorable than those provided to Mr. Saunders immediately prior to December 1, 2010 and (v) be eligible to receive compensation in connection with Succession Services. In the event Mr. Saunders' employment terminates prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, Mr. Saunders may be entitled to severance payments depending on the circumstances. The Agreement also has a fixed term ending on March 31, 2013 that does not automatically renew and eliminates the gross-up for excise taxes that may be payable with respect to severance payments and other payments deemed to be made in connection with a Change of Control.
The foregoing description is not a complete description of the Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02. Any capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement.
In addition and as previously announced on November 9, 2010, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") in order to better reflect current compensation practices and trends by transitioning away from individual agreements with certain of the Company's executive officers, including Messrs. John M. Partridge, Byron H. Pollitt, Joshua R. Floum and William M. Sheedy (collectively, the "Executive Officers"). Each of the Executive Officers has executed and returned a participation letter agreement, pursuant to which they have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the letter agreement. The Severance Plan eliminates the gross-up for excise taxes that may be payable with respect to severance payments and other payments deemed to be made in connection with a change of control (as defined in the Severance Plan).

Limitation on Payments Under Certain Circumstances
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event the Accounting Firm (as defined below) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the "") so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, the Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which the Executive is entitled hereunder.
Agreement Payments
(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and
 
no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the cash payments (to the extent such amounts are considered Payments) under the following sections in the following order: (1) any Payments under Section 6(a)(i)(C), (2) any Payments under Section 6(a)(i)(B) and (3) any other cash Agreement Payments that would be made upon a termination of the Executive's employment, beginning with payments that would be made last in time. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed ("") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (""), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Safe Harbor Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Overpayment is determined) pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code compounded semiannually; , , that no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) (A) of the Code compounded semiannually.

All records, files, memoranda, reports, customer information, client lists, documents and equipment relating to the business of the Company, which the Executive prepares, possesses or comes into contact with while the Executive is an employee of the Company, shall remain the sole property of the Company. The Executive agrees that upon the termination of his employment, he shall provide to the Company all documents, papers, files or other material in his possession and under his control that are connected with or derived from his services to the Company. The Executive agrees that the Company owns all work product, patents, copyrights and other material produced by the Executive during the Executive's employment with the Company.
Return of Company Property
(b) . The Executive shall not at any time, whether during the Executive's employment or following the termination of the Executive's employment, for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly, disclose or furnish to any entity, firm, corporation or person, except as otherwise required by law, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company with respect to any aspect of its operations, business or clients. "Confidential or proprietary information" shall mean information generally unknown to the

public to which the Executive gains access by reason of the Executive's employment by the Company and includes, but is not limited to, information relating to all present or potential customers, business and marketing plans, sales, trading and financial data and strategies and operational costs.
(c) . During the Employment Period (except in the performance of his duties to the Company hereunder) and for one year following the termination of the Executive's employment for any reason or no reason, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employees of the Company to leave the Company or in any way modify their relationship with the Company; (ii) encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company or in the modification of any such employee's relationship with the Company, or cause others to participate, encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company; or (iii) solicit the trade or patronage of any clients or customers or any prospective clients or customers of the Company.
Nonsolicitation
(d) . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purposes of the foregoing covenants are to protect the goodwill and confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and to prevent the Executive from interfering with the business of the Company as a result of or following termination of the Executive's employment with the Company; (ii) because of the nature of the business in which the Company and its affiliates are engaged and because of the nature of the confidential and proprietary information to which the Executive has access, it would be impractical and excessively difficult to determine the actual damages of the Company in the event the Executive breached any of the covenants of this Section 9; (iii) remedies at law (such as monetary damages) for any breach of the Executive's obligations under this Section 9 would be inadequate; and (iv) the terms of the covenants are sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and impose no undue hardship on the Executive. The Executive therefore agrees and consents that if the Executive commits any breach of a covenant under this Section 9 or threatens to commit any such breach, the Company shall have the right (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of California, or in any state in which the Executive resides, without posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual damage. With respect to any provision of this Section 9 finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such court shall have jurisdiction to reform this Agreement or any provision hereof so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the parties agree to abide by such court's determination. If any of the covenants of this Section 9 is determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such determination shall not be a bar to or in any way diminish the rights of the Company to enforce any such covenant in any other jurisdiction. In no event may a breach or threatened breach of the covenants in this Section 9 constitute a basis for the Company to suspend the Executive's right to receive any payments or benefits to which he is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.
Enforcement

(b) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to satisfy all of the obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to satisfy such obligations if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

Severability
(e) . No waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by any other party, or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party, shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by such other party of any similar or dissimilar provisions and conditions at the same or any prior or subsequent time.

provided, however,
(g) .(i) . It is intended that this Agreement shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury regulations relating thereto, or an exemption to Section 409A of the Code. Any payments that qualify for the "short-term deferral" exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception. For purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, each payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A of the Code deferral election rules and the exclusion under Section 409A of the Code for certain short-term deferral amounts. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code and any references to termination of employment or the Executive's Date of Termination shall mean and refer to the date of his "separation from service" as that term is defined under Section 409A of the Code. If the Participant is considered a Specified Employee, any payment that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A that is otherwise due to the Participant under this Agreement during the six-month period following his separation from service on account of his separation from service shall be accumulated and paid to the Executive on the Delayed Payment Date. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement. If the Executive dies during the Section 409A postponement period, the amounts and entitlements delayed on account of Section 409A shall be paid to the personal representative of his estate on the first to occur of the Delayed Payment Date or 30 days after the date of the Executive's death.

Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, this Release shall not affect, and the Executive does not waive: (i) rights to indemnification the Executive may have under (A) applicable law, (B) any other agreement between the Executive and a Released Party and (C) as an insured under any director's and officer's liability insurance policy now or previously in force; (ii) any right the Executive may have to obtain contribution in the event of the entry of judgment against the Executive as a result of any act or failure to act for which both the Executive and the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries (collectively, the "") are jointly responsible; (iii) the Executive's rights to benefits and payments under any stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other incentive plans or under any retirement plan, welfare benefit plan or other benefit or deferred compensation plan, all of which shall remain in effect in accordance with the terms and provisions of such benefit and/or incentive plans and any agreements under which such stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units or other awards or incentives were granted or benefits were made available; (iv) the Executive's rights as a stockholder of any of the Affiliated Entities; (v) any obligations of the Affiliated Entities under the Employment Agreement; or (vi) any claims by the Executive that cannot be released by a private settlement agreement.
Affiliated Entities

this Release with the Company before executing it (and that any modification of this Release, whether material or immaterial, will not restart or change the original 21 day consideration period) and the Executive fully understands that by signing below the Executive is voluntarily giving up any right which the Executive may have to sue or bring any other claims against the Released Parties; (b) has been given seven days after returning this Release to the Company to revoke this Release; (c) has been advised to consult legal counsel regarding the terms of this Release; (d) has carefully read and fully understands all of the provisions of this Release; (e) knowingly and voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release; and (f) knowingly and voluntarily intends to be legally bound by the same. The Executive also understands that, notwithstanding anything in this Release to the contrary, nothing in this Release shall be construed to prohibit the Executive from (i) filing a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Department of Fair Employment and Housing or any other federal, state or local administrative or regulatory agency, or (ii) participating in any investigation or proceedings conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Department of Fair Employment and Housing or any other federal, state or local administrative or regulatory agency; however, the Executive expressly waives the right to any relief of any kind in the event that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Department of Fair Employment and Housing or any other federal, state or local administrative or regulatory agency pursues any claim on the Executive's behalf.
This Release is final and binding and may not be changed or modified except in a writing signed by both parties.

Approval of the Visa Inc. Incentive Plan
At the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Visa Inc. (the "Company") held on January 27, 2011, the Company's stockholders approved the Visa Inc. Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "VIP"). The VIP was originally adopted in 2007 and amendments to the VIP were approved by the Company's Compensation Committee on October 19, 2010, subject to stockholder approval.
The VIP provides for awards of cash incentive compensation that are payable to employees upon satisfaction of specified performance goals over a specified performance period. The Company's management (subject to final approval of the Chief Executive Officer) or, for any participant covered by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"), the Compensation Committee will determine the payment amount of individual awards based on the achievement of: (i) threshold corporate performance goals; and/or (ii) corporate and individual performance goals, provided that no payment based on the achievement of these goals may be greater than $10 million in any plan year for each of the Chief Executive Officer and other participants covered by Section 162(m). With respect to any individual performance goals other than those for the Chief Executive Officer and other participants covered by Section 162(m), management will recommend a payout level of the individual component for the participant based on the participant's performance and certain payout guidelines determined by the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the plan year. The Compensation Committee determines the payout level relating to any individual goals for the Chief Executive Officer and any other participants who are covered by Section 162(m).
For more information about the VIP, see our definitive proxy statement dated December 13, 2010. The description above and such portions of the proxy statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the VIP, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Declassification Director Resignation Policy
For information regarding the resignation and election of directors in connection with the approval of a proposal to declassify the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), refer to Item 5.03 of this Form 8-K, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
Founding Directors
The Board has conferred the honorary title of "Founding Director" on each of Messrs. Al-Qadi, Doyle, Hawkins, McKay, Scharf and Schulin-Zeuthen in recognition of their service and contributions to Visa from 2007-2010. The Founding Directors are not members of the Company's Board, are not entitled to vote at and are not counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at any meeting of the Board, and do not have any fiduciary duties to Visa or its stockholders. Messrs. Al-Qadi, Doyle, Hawkins, McKay, Scharf and Schulin-Zeuthen will not receive any compensation as Founding Directors. The Board may terminate their status as Founding Directors at any time.
 
At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") to eliminate the classified Board and to provide instead for the annual election of directors (the "Declassification Amendment"), effective at the Annual Meeting. The Board previously approved the Declassification Amendment and recommended that it be submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval. To implement the Declassification Amendment, the Board previously also approved an amendment to Article III, Section 3.3 of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), contingent upon stockholder approval of the Declassification Amendment. This amendment to the Bylaws became effective on January 27, 2011 upon effectiveness of the filing of the Declassification Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware.
In order to immediately declassify the Board at the Annual Meeting following approval of the Declassification Amendment, the Company adopted the Declassification Director Resignation Policy. Under the Company's Declassification Director Resignation Policy, each of the Company's directors whose term did not expire at the Annual Meeting tendered his or her resignation from his or her Class II or Class III term, as applicable, contingent and effective upon stockholder approval of the Declassification Amendment. As described in Item 5.07, each such director was thereafter elected to the Board to serve for a one year term until the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders.
At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders also approved a proposal to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to implement a majority vote standard in uncontested elections of directors, effective at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Majority Vote Amendment"). The Board previously approved the Majority Vote Amendment and recommended that it be submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval.
 
As a result of the Majority Vote Amendment, in an uncontested election of the Company's directors, a director will only be elected if a majority of the votes cast are "For" his or her election. Additionally, pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, each incumbent nominee will be required to submit an irrevocable contingent resignation letter prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for an annual meeting at which the nominee's candidacy will be considered. If the nominee does not receive more votes cast "For" than "Against" their election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board that it accept the nominee's contingent resignation, unless it determines that acceptance of the resignation would not be in Visa's best interests. Prior to the adoption of the Majority Vote Amendment, a director could be elected without receiving a majority of votes cast "For" his or her election and even if the number of "Withheld" votes exceeded the number of "For" votes. To implement the Majority Vote Amendment, the Board also previously approved an amendment to Article III, Section 3.3 of the Bylaws, contingent upon stockholder approval of the Majority Vote Amendment. This amendment to the Bylaws became effective on January 27, 2011 upon effectiveness of the filing of the Majority Vote Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the such amendments, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
As described in Items 5.02 and 5.03 above, the Company held the Annual Meeting on January 27, 2011. Only holders of the Company's class A common stock at the close of business on December 3, 2010 (the "Record Date") were entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 496,799,230 shares of class A common stock entitled to vote. A total of 375,973,838 shares of class A common stock (75.67%), constituting a quorum, were represented in person or by valid proxies at the Annual Meeting.
The stockholders voted on seven proposals at the Annual Meeting. The proposals are described in detail in the Company's definitive proxy statement dated December 13, 2010. As Proposal 1 (to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the Board) was approved, Proposal 3 (to elect ten directors) was submitted to the stockholders and voted upon and Proposal 4 (to elect three Class I directors) was not submitted to the stockholders. The final results for the votes regarding each proposal are set forth below.
As described in Item 5.03 above, the Company's stockholders approved the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the Board. The votes regarding this proposal were as follows:

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal first quarter 2011 ended December 31, 2010. GAAP net income for the quarter was $884 million, or $1.23 per diluted class A common share. The weighted average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was approximately 719 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 2, 2011
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2011 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year and driven by strong double-digit growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards quarterly net operating revenues.
"Visa's first quarter was a great start to our fiscal 2011 as evidenced by strong earnings fueled by continued growth in payments volume, cross border volume and processed transactions globally  our core business," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc.
"Visa is in a strong position to continue to accelerate the migration to electronic payments, particularly in economies where cash and check remain predominant. We are intensely focused on growing Visa's revenue globally, working alongside our financial institution, merchant, technology and government partners. In parallel, we are aggressively investing to expand Visa payment services through new technology platforms, like mobile, eCommerce and money transfer, to extend the reach and value of our global network."
Fiscal First Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2010, on which fiscal first quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 14% over the prior year at $829 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2010, was a positive 15% over the prior year at $897 billion.
Cross border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 15% for the three months ended December 31, 2010.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended December 31, 2010, were 13 billion, a positive 15% increase over the prior year.
 
For the fiscal first quarter 2011, service revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of 22% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 10% over the prior year to $844 million. International transaction revenues, which are principally driven by cross border payments volume, grew 14% over the prior year to $630 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $161 million, a 15% decrease over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $405 million and represents 15% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $872 million for the quarter, a 17% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010.
Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 36% for quarter ended December 31, 2010.
Notable Events:
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company effectively repurchased approximately 15.3 million shares at an average price of $72.08 per share, for a total cost of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, $800 million of shares were effectively repurchased through the October funding of the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. On an as-converted basis, 11 million shares of class A common stock were effectively repurchased at $72.74 per share. The balance of the repurchase, $306 million of class A common stock, was executed in the open market and totaled 4.3 million shares at an average price of $70.40 per share. These purchases were made under the previously announced $1.0 billion share repurchase plan, as authorized by the Company's board of directors. At December 31, 2010, the share repurchase plan had remaining authorized funds of $694 million.
As previously announced, on January 26, 2011, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Visa International sold its 10 percent stake in Visa Vale issuer CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Bradesco. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil and Visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction. Visa's proceeds from the sale were $103 million. The sale is subject to regulatory approval by Brazil's Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econmica.
 
On January 27, 2011, the Company held its 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. Among other proposals, stockholders approved the immediate declassification of the Board of Directors, approved implementation of a majority vote standard in uncontested elections of directors (effective at the 2012 annual meeting), approved compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in the Company's proxy statement (on an advisory basis) and selected an annual advisory vote on executive compensation (on an advisory basis).
In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a class C share release program, in which all remaining 55 million class C shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, 2011. Class C shares sold in the public market upon release will automatically convert to class A common stock. The release of the class C shares will not increase the number of outstanding shares on an as-converted basis of the Company's common stock, and there will be no dilutive effect to the outstanding class A common stock share count on an as-converted basis. Also, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on March 1, 2011, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of February 11, 2011.

These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

Item 7.01
Regulation FD Disclosure.
In anticipation of investor discussions around payments volume, cross border volume and processed transactions growth at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on Wednesday, February 16, 2011, and the KBW Cards, Payments & Financial Technology Symposium on Thursday, February 17, 2011, Visa is providing selected data for January and February 2011.
For the month of January 2011, U.S. aggregate payments volume growth was positive 10% versus the prior year period. Further broken down, U.S. credit payments volume growth was positive 6% and debit payments volume growth was positive 14%. January cross border volume on a constant dollar basis was 14% over the prior year period. January processed transactions grew positively 14% globally.
Through February 11, 2011, U.S. aggregate payments volume growth was positive 10% versus the prior year period. Further broken down, U.S. credit payments volume growth was positive 10% and debit payments volume growth was positive 10%. Cross border volume on a constant dollar basis was 13% over the prior year period. Processed transactions grew positively 13% globally.
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instructions A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under the terms of Visa Inc.'s Certificate of Incorporation, shares of Visa's class B common stock are subject to transfer restrictions until March 25, 2011, or when the "Covered Litigation," as described in Visa's Certificate of Incorporation, has been resolved, whichever is later. At this time, Visa does not expect the Covered Litigation to be resolved by March 25, 2011, and cannot estimate with accuracy when it will be resolved. As such, Visa is unable to predict when the transfer restrictions covering its class B common stock will end.
The Covered Litigation includes several cases, including the merchant class action Visa refers to as the Interchange Litigation and the Attridge Litigation. The Interchange Litigation is not expected to go to trial until the Fall of 2012 at the soonest. Following any trial, the case would likely be subject to court process and appeals that could significantly delay final resolution. Additionally, any negotiated settlement of this case would be subject to court approval, which generally takes time to obtain in federal class action cases. It is also likely that some merchants will opt out of the class, which would require additional settlements or judgments before the Covered Litigation is resolved. Similarly, at this time Visa is not able to predict when the Attridge Litigation will be resolved.
Additional information on the Covered Litigation can be found in Visa's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and future SEC filings will report additional developments. Information on Visa's class B shares can be found on Visa's Investor Relations website.

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Results and Authorizes New $1 Billion Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal second quarter 2011 ended March 31, 2011. GAAP net income for the quarter was $881 million, or $1.23 per diluted class A common share. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was approximately 714 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 5, 2011
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter of 2011 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 15% over the prior year and driven by strong double-digit growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 2% towards quarterly net operating revenues.
"Visa delivered a solid financial performance in our fiscal second quarter with double-digit growth in payments volume, cross border volume and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "With a strong first half of our fiscal 2011 year behind us, we remain focused on driving continued transaction growth, maintaining strong financial performance and expense control discipline, and delivering value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs and dividend payments."
"In addition to working with our financial institutions and merchant clients to expand card issuance and acceptance for our core products, we are investing in new platforms, channels and technologies that will deliver value to our clients and consumers for years to come," continued Saunders. "The global adoption of mobile and internet technology presents an enormous opportunity for Visa to leverage our network and proven track record of delivering electronic payments worldwide."
Fiscal Second Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2010, on which fiscal second quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 15% over the prior year at $897 billion.
 
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $861 billion.

Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, were 12 billion, a positive 13% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal second quarter 2011, service revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $823 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 14% over the prior year to $624 million.

Visa Unveils Next Generation
Electronic Payments and Services
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a global leader in electronic payments, today announced the next generation of payments solutions that will replicate the ease, reliability and security of Visa point-of-sale payments within traditional and digital eCommerce, mobile commerce and burgeoning social networking commerce environments. New offerings are expected to include a secure cross-channel digital wallet and a range of customized mobile payments services that address the specific requirements of geographic markets around the world.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11, 2011
"Our new solutions deliver greater consumer choice, convenience and control while helping our clients grow their businesses. By helping to reduce abandoned online shopping carts and bringing new account holders into the Visa network, we create a win-win-win for merchants, consumers and financial institutions," noted Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "In addition, we believe Visa's new payments products and services will help expand financial inclusion to the billions of mobile subscribers today who currently lack access to traditional financial services."
Simplifying Commerce in Complex Economies
In certain countries with established electronic payments infrastructures, expansive Internet usage and broad mobile network penetration, Visa will be introducing a digital wallet and services platform. The digital wallet will store Visa and non-Visa payments accounts, support NFC payments through the innovative Visa payWave application and deliver a wide range of transaction services to accommodate multiple commerce scenariosincluding eCommerce, mobile commerce, micropayments, social networks and person-to-person payments.
Visa is working with leading payments card issuers, community banks, credit unions, acquirers, payments processors and merchants to launch the digital wallet. Among the financial institutions and organizations supporting Visa's wallet strategy are:
 
Visa expects to launch the digital wallet in the U.S. and Canada in fall 2011.
Key features of the wallet are expected to include:
 
 
 
 
"The widespread adoption of Internet and mobile technology is changing the way people connect and transact across the globe, so we're focused on delivering locally-tailored payments products and services," said Saunders. "We are introducing new solutions for eCommerce and mobile devices that provide the same Visa-quality' experienceconvenience, reliability and securitypeople enjoy when using their Visa cards at a retail location. In doing so, we are accelerating the global shift to digital payments by harnessing our brand, products, network and 50-plus years of payments experience."
Mobilizing Payments in Emerging Economies
In certain emerging geographic markets with significant mobile penetration, Visa will work with financial institutions and mobile-network operators to provide consumers with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment and the ability to transfer and receive funds, manage financial accounts or top-up wireless air time using their mobile handset. The wide range of features and functions being developed for the digital wallet will allow Visa to pursue a number of strategies to tailor or bundle services to local needs.
 
 
Across all emerging geographic markets, Visa's sophisticated payments technology and significant work in establishing global payments standards will aid in navigating the complexity of the myriad of network operators, handset models and operating systems in use globally, helping to enable millions of new and existing Visa account holders to simply use mobile technology for payments services.
Innovation, Acquisitions and Partnerships Expand Capabilities of Visa Network
Visa is developing its next generation services by integrating VisaNet, its global processing network, leading credit, debit, prepaid and commercial product platforms, new capabilities it has acquired through its subsidiaries CyberSource, Authorize.net and PlaySpan, and the unique expertise and services of key commercial partners. In deploying flexible solutions that are locally relevant and globally interoperable, Visa aims to attract more participants to its network and better enable them to connect and transact.
"Our build, buy and partner approach puts Visa in a unique position to deliver the speed-to-market and scalable solutions needed to stay ahead of new demands created by the convergence of Internet, mobile and electronic payments technologies," said Saunders. "Visa and our subsidiaries are working with financial institutions, merchants, mobile network operators, and innovative technology providers to bring new ways to pay and be paid to more consumers and merchants around the globe."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results and Authorizes New $1 Billion Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter 2011 ended June 30, 2011. GAAP net income for the quarter, inclusive of a non-cash, non-operating gain related to the Company's revaluation of its Visa Europe put option, was $1.0 billion.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 27, 2011
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option, net income for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year, and diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $1.26, an increase of 29% over the prior year. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was approximately 704 million. The Company's adjusted quarterly net income per class A common shares outstanding is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2011 was $2.3 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year and driven by strong double-digit growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed two percentage points of growth towards quarterly net operating revenues.
"Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial and operational performance as we benefitted from growth in global payments volume, and solid cross border and processed transaction growth," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "As we address the new regulatory landscape, we are prepared to deliver on our financial goals and remain an industry leading growth company in the global transactions space."
"Visa is a diverse global enterprise, with strong positions in both developed and emerging markets around the world, and we are committed to further diversifying our business and accelerating growth in key
 
markets worldwide," said Saunders. "We are executing on our growth strategy, investing heavily in innovation and taking important steps to bring new products and solutions to our partners and consumers."
Fiscal Third Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, on which fiscal third quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $862 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2011, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $941 billion.
Cross border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 14% for the three months ended June 30, 2011.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended June 30, 2011, were 13 billion, a positive 11% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal third quarter 2011, service revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 12% over the prior year to $886 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 15% over the prior year to $662 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $167 million, a 10% decrease over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $448 million and represents 16% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $977 million for the quarter, a 10% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.7 billion at June 30, 2011.
Visa's effective tax rate was 38% for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option.
 
Notable Events:
On June 6, 2011, the Company acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies, for total consideration of approximately $110 million paid with cash on hand. In addition, the Company announced a new, long-term commercial agreement with Monitise plc, a leading provider of mobile money solutions for financial institutions in more developed geographies. The combination of acquiring Fundamo and expanding the relationship with Monitise will enable Visa to deliver best-in-class mobile financial services and payments capabilities to consumers across the full spectrum of uses, geographies and mobile environments from basic services on simple handsets to more advanced services for smart phone owners.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Earnings Results and Increases Existing Share Repurchase Program by $1 Billion
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2011. For the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2011, GAAP net income was $880 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. GAAP diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $1.27 - an increase of 20% over the prior year on a GAAP basis, or an increase of 34% over the prior year on an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option). The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was approximately 692 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 26, 2011
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories. Currency fluctuations contributed 2 percentage points of growth towards quarterly net operating revenues.
On an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option), net income for the full-year was $3.5 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $4.99, an increase of 28% over the prior year on an adjusted basis.
GAAP net income for the full-year was $3.6 billion, inclusive of the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $5.16. The Company's adjusted quarterly and full-year net income per class A common share outstanding are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding was approximately 707 million.
 
GAAP net operating revenue for the full-year was $9.2 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year and driven by double-digit revenue growth contributions from service, data processing and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed 2 percentage points of growth towards full-year net operating revenues.
"Visa continues to deliver strong results, with fourth quarter and full year performance reflecting a business that is both resilient and flexible enough to adapt and flourish in a changing business environment," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc.
"Throughout the quarter and the year, we have been diligent in our efforts to grow our core business, while successfully unlocking new revenue opportunities through strategic investments, both in our core business and into innovations that will ensure our foundation for future growth remains strong. This foundation will allow us to effectively drive transactions, pursue global growth in new markets and provide our clients with innovative ways to provide safe electronic payments to their customers."

Adjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share
US$ in millions, except per share data
Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods. The revaluation of the Visa Europe put option during the third fiscal quarter resulted in non-cash, non-operating income during fiscal 2011. The reduction in the fair value of the put option was primarily the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. Management therefore believes that the resulting non-operating income is not indicative of Visa's performance in the current or future periods.

On December 23, 2011, Visa Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing it had decided to deposit $1.565 billion (the "Loss Funds") into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the value of the Company's Class B shares  which are held exclusively by U.S. financial institutions and their affiliates and successors  is correspondingly adjusted via a reduction in the Class B shareholders' as-converted share count. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count. The Company will make this deposit by using funds previously allocated to its current $2 billion class A repurchase program, which was announced on July 27 and October 26, 2011, and which will exhaust all funds available under that program. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be conducted in accordance with the Company's certificate of incorporation currently in effect.

Approval of the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as Amended and Restated
At the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Visa Inc. (the "Company") held on January 31, 2012, the Company's stockholders approved the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "EIP"). The EIP was originally adopted in 2007 and amendments to the EIP were approved by the Company's Compensation Committee in October 2011 and board of directors (the "Board") in November 2011, subject to stockholder approval.
The EIP authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and performance-based awards to the Company's employees, consultants and non-employee directors whose contributions are considered essential to the continued growth and success of the Company and its affiliates. Up to 59 million shares of the Company's common stock may be delivered under the EIP, subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee as outlined in the EIP. No awards may be granted under the EIP on or after 10 years from January 31, 2012. Time-based vesting awards under the EIP generally vest over a period of time determined in accordance with the terms of the EIP, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions, which are set forth in the EIP. The number of shares or amount of cash to be earned under performance-based awards depends upon the Company's achievement of specified performance goals. In the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the EIP) of the Company, the Compensation Committee may provide for the accelerated vesting of outstanding awards, may provide that awards will be assumed or replaced, may provide for the cash-out of awards and/or deem target payment opportunities under any performance-based awards as earned, among other things. The Compensation Committee has the exclusive authority to administer the terms of the EIP. In connection with the stockholder approval of the EIP, awards granted under the EIP may be structured to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
For more information about the EIP, please see our definitive proxy statement dated December 14, 2011. The description above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EIP, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Delegation of Administration
4.1          .  The shares of stock subject to Awards granted under the Plan shall be Shares.

Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the total number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be 59,000,000. Subject to, in the case of ISOs, any limitations applicable thereto under the Code, if (a) any Shares are subject to an Option, SAR, or other Award which for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been fully exercised or satisfied, or are subject to any Restricted Stock Award (including any Shares subject to a Participant's Restricted Stock Award that are repurchased by the Company at the Participant's cost), Restricted Stock Unit Award or other Award granted under the Plan which are forfeited, or (b) any Award based on Shares is settled for cash, expires or otherwise terminates without the issuance of such Shares, the Shares subject to such Award shall, to the extent of any such expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or cash settlement, be available for delivery in connection with future Awards under the Plan. Any Shares delivered under the Plan upon exercise or satisfaction of Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares
Number of Shares Available for Grants
 
available for delivery under the Plan; provided, however, that the total number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be the number of Shares set forth in the third sentence of this Section 4.1, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.1, but without application of the foregoing provisions of this sentence.
4.2          .  In the event of any corporate event or transaction (including a change in the Shares or the capitalization of the Company), such as a reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Code), issuance of warrants or rights, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, stock or other property), stock split or reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, or other like change in corporate structure, partial or complete liquidation of the Company or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the Committee shall substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number, class and kind of securities which may be delivered under Section 4.1; the number, class and kind, and/or price (such as the Option Price of Options or the Grant Price of SARs) of securities subject to outstanding Awards; the numerical limits set forth in Section 5.3; and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. The Committee shall also make appropriate adjustments and modifications in the terms of any outstanding Awards to reflect or related to any such events, adjustments, substitutions or changes. Any adjustment, substitution or change pursuant to this Section 4.2 made with respect to an Award intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee shall not make any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 that would cause an Award that is otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A to become subject to Code Section 409A, or that would cause an Award that is subject to Code Section 409A to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A. All determinations of the Committee as to adjustments or changes, if any, under this Section 4.2 shall be conclusive and binding on the Participants.
Adjustments in Authorized Shares
4.3          .  The existence of the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in its capital structure or business structure, any merger or consolidation, any issuance of debt, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares, additional shares of capital stock or other securities or subscription rights thereto, any dissolution or liquidation, any sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding.

Individual Limitations on Awards
(a)      Individual Limit for Options and SARs. The maximum number of Shares with respect to which Options and SARs may be granted to any Participant in any Fiscal Year shall be 2,000,000. In connection with a Participant's commencement of service for the Company, any Affiliate
 
or Subsidiary, as applicable, a Participant may be granted Options and SARs for up to an additional 2,000,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in the previous sentence. The foregoing limitation(s) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2. To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code or the regulations thereunder, in applying the foregoing limitation(s) with respect to a Participant, if any Option or SAR is canceled, the canceled Option or SAR shall continue to count against the maximum number of Shares with respect to which Options and SARs may be granted to the Participant.
(b)      Individual Limit for Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares. For awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the maximum number of Awards that may be granted to any Participant in any Fiscal Year shall be 2,000,000 Shares. The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2.
(c)      Performance Units and Cash-Based Awards. For awards of Performance Units and Cash-Based Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the maximum amount that may be paid to a Participant pursuant to such Awards for an annual Performance Period shall be $30,000,000 and for any other Performance Period, such amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the Performance Period and the denominator of which is twelve (12). The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2.
6.1          .  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted to Participants in such number, and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee.
Grant of Options
6.2          .  Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Option Price, the maximum duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains, the conditions upon which the Option shall become exercisable and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine, which are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. The Award Agreement also shall specify whether the Option is intended to be an ISO or an NQSO. To the extent that any Option does not qualify as an ISO (whether because of its provisions or the time or manner of its exercise or otherwise), such Option, or the portion thereof which does not so qualify, shall constitute a separate NQSO.
Award Agreement
6.3          .  The Option Price for each Option shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided that, subject to Section 6.8(c), the Option Price of an Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted; provided further, that Substitute Awards or Awards granted in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4.2, in the form of stock options, shall have an Option Price per Share that is intended to maintain the economic value of the Award that was replaced or adjusted, as determined by the Committee.
Option Price
6.4          .  Each Option granted to a Participant shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its date of grant, subject to the respective last sentences of Sections 6.5 and 6.8(c).
Duration of Options
 
6.5          .  Options shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance determine and set forth in the Award Agreement, which need not be the same for each grant or for each Option or Participant. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which an Option other than an ISO may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such Option the Participant's exercise of such Option would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the Option may only be exercised to the extent the Option was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such Option first would no longer violate such laws.
Exercise of Options
6.6          .  Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company, in a form specified or accepted by the Committee, or by complying with any alternative exercise procedures that may be authorized by the Committee, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for such Shares, which shall include applicable taxes, if any, in accordance with Article XVII. The Option Price upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent; (b) subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may prescribe, by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) unencumbered Shares previously acquired by the Participant exercising such Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price, (c) by a combination of (a) and (b); or (d) by any other method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion, including, if the Committee so determines, (x) a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise that complies with all applicable laws or (y) withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant pursuant to the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of a written notification of exercise and full payment in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 6.6, the Company shall deliver to the Participant exercising an Option, in the Participant's name, evidence of book entry Shares, or, upon the Participant's request, Share certificates, in an appropriate amount based upon the number of Shares purchased under the Option, subject to Section 20.10. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all payments under all of the methods described above shall be paid in United States dollars.
Payment
6.7          .  Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, an Option may be exercised only to the extent that it is then exercisable, and if at all times during the period beginning with the date of granting of such Option and ending on the date of exercise of such Option the Participant is an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, and shall terminate immediately upon a Termination of the Participant. An Option shall cease to become exercisable upon a Termination of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 to the contrary, the Committee may determine in its discretion that an Option may be exercised following any such Termination, whether or not exercisable at the time of such Termination; provided, however, that in no event may an Option be exercised after the expiration date of such Option specified in the applicable Award Agreement, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 6.5.
Termination of Employment or Service
6.8          .
Limitations on Incentive Stock Options
(a)      .  No ISO shall be granted to any individual otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who is not an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary on the date of granting of such Option. Any ISO granted under the Plan shall contain such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as the Committee may determine to be necessary to qualify such Option as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. Any ISO granted under the Plan may be modified by the Committee to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.
General
 
(b)      .  Notwithstanding any intent to grant ISOs, an Option granted under the Plan will not be considered an ISO to the extent that it, together with any other "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to subsection (d) of such Section) under the Plan and any other "incentive stock option" plans of the Company, any Subsidiary and any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code, are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year with respect to Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 (or such other limit as may be required by the Code) as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. The rule set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted.
$100,000 Per Year Limitation
(c)      .  No ISO shall be granted to an individual otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code), at the time the Option is granted, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or a Subsidiary or any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code. This restriction does not apply if at the time such ISO is granted the Option Price of the ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date such ISO is granted, and the ISO by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from such date of grant.
Options Granted to Certain Stockholders
7.1          .  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, SARs may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee may grant an SAR (a) in connection and simultaneously with the grant of an Option (a Tandem SAR) or (b) independent of, and unrelated to, an Option (a Freestanding SAR).
Grant of SARs
7.2          .  The Grant Price for each SAR shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, subject to the limitations of this Section 7.2. The Grant Price for each Freestanding SAR shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date such Freestanding SAR is granted, except in the case of Substitute Awards or Awards granted in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4.2. The Grant Price of a Tandem SAR shall be equal to the Option Price of the related Option.
Grant Price
7.3          .  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent the related Option is exercisable and may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which the related Option is then exercisable. A Tandem SAR shall entitle a Participant to elect, in the manner set forth in the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, in lieu of exercising his or her unexercised related Option for all or a portion of the Shares for which such Option is then exercisable pursuant to its terms, to surrender such Option to the Company with respect to any or all of such Shares and to receive from the Company in exchange therefor a payment described in Section 7.7. An Option with respect to which a Participant has elected to exercise a Tandem SAR shall, to the extent of the Shares covered by such exercise, be canceled automatically and surrendered to the Company. Such Option shall thereafter remain exercisable according to its terms only with respect to the number of Shares as to which it would otherwise be exercisable, less the number of Shares with respect to which such Tandem SAR has been so exercised. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO: (a) the Tandem SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the related ISO; (b) the value of the payment with respect to the Tandem SAR may not exceed the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the related ISO at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised and the Option Price of the related ISO; and (c) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the ISO exceeds the Option Price of the ISO.
Exercise of Tandem SARs
 
7.4          .  Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion, in accordance with the Plan, determines and sets forth in the Award Agreement. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which a Freestanding SAR may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such SAR the Participant's exercise of such SAR would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the SAR may only be exercised to the extent the SAR was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such SAR first would no longer violate such laws.
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
7.5          .  Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains, the Grant Price, the term of the SAR, and such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine in accordance with the Plan.
Award Agreement
7.6          .  The term of a SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the term of any Tandem SAR shall be the same as the related Option and no SAR shall be exercisable more than ten (10) years after it is granted, subject to the last sentence of Section 6.5 in the case of a Tandem SAR.
Term of SARs
7.7          .  An election to exercise SARs shall be deemed to have been made on the date of Notice of such election to the Company. As soon as practicable following such Notice, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
(a)      The excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the Grant Price of the SAR; by
(b)      The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7 to the contrary, the Committee may establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement a maximum amount per Share that will be payable upon the exercise of a SAR. At the discretion of the Committee, such payment upon exercise of a SAR shall be in cash, in Shares of equivalent Fair Market Value, or in some combination thereof.
7.8          .  Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, a SAR may be exercised only to the extent that it is then exercisable, and if at all times during the period beginning with the date of granting of such SAR and ending on the date of exercise of such SAR the Participant is an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, and shall terminate immediately upon a Termination of the Participant. A SAR shall cease to become exercisable upon a Termination of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 to the contrary, the Committee may determine in its discretion that a SAR may be exercised following any such Termination, whether or not exercisable at the time of such Termination; provided, however, that in no event may a SAR be exercised after the expiration date of such SAR specified in the applicable Award Agreement, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 6.5 (in the case of Tandem SARs) or in the last sentence of Section 7.4 (in the case of Freestanding SARs). To the extent applicable to any Tandem SAR, the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 are subject to the provisions of Section 6.8, pursuant to the provisions Section 7.3.
Termination of Employment or Service
8.1          .  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units to Participants in such amounts as the Committee shall determine.
Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
 
8.2          .  Each Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock or the number of Restricted Stock Units granted, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine in accordance with the Plan.
Award Agreement
8.3          .  Except as provided in this Article VIII, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered, alienated, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction established by the Committee and specified in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.
Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock
8.4          .  The Period of Restriction shall lapse based on continuing service as a Non-Employee Director or Consultant or continuing employment with the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate, the achievement of performance goals, the satisfaction of other conditions or restrictions or upon the occurrence of other events, in each case, as determined by the Committee, at its discretion, and stated in the Award Agreement. If the grants of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), the Committee will set restrictions based upon the achievement of the performance goals set forth in Section 9.3 and will determine achievement of such goals in accordance with Section 9.3.
Period of Restriction and Other Restrictions
8.5          .  Subject to Section 20.10, after the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable to a Participant's Shares of Restricted Stock, and after all conditions and restrictions applicable to such Shares of Restricted Stock have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable withholding tax obligations), pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement, such Shares of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by such Participant. After the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable to a Participant's Restricted Stock Units, and after all conditions and restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock Units have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable withholding tax obligations), pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement, such Restricted Stock Units shall be settled by delivery of Shares, a cash payment determined by reference to the then-current Fair Market Value of Shares or a combination of Shares and such cash payment as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or otherwise.
Delivery of Shares, Payment of Restricted Stock Units
8.6          .  Each Participant who receives an Award of Shares of Restricted Stock shall be issued a stock certificate or certificates evidencing the Shares covered by such Award registered in the name of such Participant, which certificate or certificates may contain an appropriate legend. The Committee may require a Participant who receives a certificate or certificates evidencing a Restricted Stock Award to immediately deposit such certificate or certificates, together with a stock power or other appropriate instrument of transfer, endorsed in blank by the Participant, with signatures guaranteed in accordance with the Exchange Act if required by the Committee, with the Secretary of the Company or an escrow holder as provided in the immediately following sentence. The Secretary of the Company or such escrow holder as the Committee may appoint shall retain physical custody of each certificate representing a Restricted Stock Award until the Period of Restriction and any other restrictions imposed by the Committee or under the Award Agreement with respect to the Shares evidenced by such certificate expire or shall have been removed. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that a Participant's ownership of Shares of Restricted Stock prior to the lapse of the Period of Restriction or any other applicable restrictions shall, in lieu of such certificates, be evidenced by a "book entry" (i.e., a computerized or manual entry) in the records of the Company or its designated agent in the name of the Participant who has received such Award. Such records of the Company or such agent shall, absent manifest error, be binding on all Participants who receive Restricted Stock Awards evidenced in such manner. The holding of Shares of Restricted Stock by the Company or such an escrow holder, or the use of book entries to evidence the ownership of Shares of Restricted Stock, in accordance with this Section 8.6, shall not affect the rights of Participants as owners of the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded to them, nor affect the restrictions applicable to such shares under the Award Agreement or the Plan, including the Period of Restriction.
Forms of Restricted Stock Awards
 
8.7          .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in a Participant's Award Agreement, to the extent permitted or required by law, as determined by the Committee, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be granted the right to exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares during the Period of Restriction. A Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.
Voting Rights
8.8          .  During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be credited with any cash dividends paid with respect to such Shares while they are so held, unless determined otherwise by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee may apply any restrictions to such dividends that the Committee deems appropriate. Except as set forth in the Award Agreement, in the event of (a) any adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, or (b) any shares or securities are received as a dividend, or an extraordinary dividend is paid in cash, on Shares of Restricted Stock, any new or additional Shares or securities or any extraordinary dividends paid in cash received by a recipient of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including the Period of Restriction, as it relates to the original Shares of Restricted Stock.
Dividends and Other Distributions
8.9          .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.9, during the Period of Restriction, any Restricted Stock Units and/or Shares of Restricted Stock held by a Participant shall be forfeited and revert to the Company (or, if Shares of Restricted Sock were sold to the Participant, the Participant shall be required to resell such Shares to the Company at cost) upon the Participant's Termination or the failure to meet or satisfy any applicable performance goals or other terms, conditions and restrictions to the extent set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Each applicable Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which, if any, the Participant shall have the right to retain Restricted Stock Units and/or Shares of Restricted Stock, then subject to the Period of Restriction, following such Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement, need not be uniform among all such Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for, or circumstances of, such Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
9.1          .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Performance Units, Performance Shares, and/or Cash-Based Awards may be granted to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee, in accordance with the Plan. A Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award entitles the Participant who receives such Award to receive Shares or cash upon the attainment of performance goals and/or satisfaction of other terms and conditions determined by the Committee when the Award is granted and set forth in the Award Agreement. Such entitlements of a Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award shall be reflected by a bookkeeping entry in the records of the Company, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement.
Grant of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
9.2          .  Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. Each Cash-Based Award shall have a value as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or value of Performance Units and Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant.
Value of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
 
9.3          .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards shall be entitled to receive payment on the number and value of Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals and/or other terms and conditions have been achieved or satisfied. The Committee shall determine the extent to which any such pre-established performance goals and/or other terms and conditions of a Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award are attained or not attained following conclusion of the applicable Performance Period. The Committee may, in its discretion, waive any such performance goals and/or other terms and conditions relating to any such Award. The performance goals applicable to a payment hereunder may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement using one or more of the following measures:
Earning of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
 
 
 
9.4          Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of a Subsidiary, division, business segment or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. The Committee may also exclude charges related to an event or occurrence which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) the cumulative effects of tax or accounting changes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The measures which constitute the performance goals may, at the discretion of the Committee, be based on pro forma numbers and may, as the Committee specifies, either include or exclude the effect of payment of the bonuses under the Plan or any other bonus plans of the Company. The performance goals may differ from Participant to Participant. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder. In establishing a performance goal, the Committee may, to the extent doing so does not cause any amount payable hereunder that is intended to be performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) to cease to so qualify, provide that the attainment of the performance goal shall be measured by appropriately adjusting the evaluation of the performance goal performance to exclude (i) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year, or (ii) the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Company's or a business unit's reported results.
9.5          .  Payment of earned Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards shall be as determined by the Committee and as set forth in the Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Period and following the Committee's determination of actual performance against the performance goals and/or other terms and conditions established by the Committee. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions imposed by the Committee, including pursuant to Section 20.10. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form of payment of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.
Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
9.6          .  A Participant receiving a Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to Shares, if any, actually received by the Participant upon satisfaction or achievement of the terms and conditions of such Award and not with respect to Shares subject to the Award but not actually issued to such Participant.
Rights as a Stockholder
9.7          .  Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to retain Performance Units, Performance Shares and/or Cash-Based Award following such Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement, need not be uniform among all such Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
 
10.1          .  The Committee may grant types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of the Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted Shares), in such amounts (subject to Article IV) and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine. Such Other Stock-Based Awards may involve the transfer of actual Shares to Participants, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Shares and may include Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States.
Other Stock-Based Awards
10.2          .  Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be expressed in terms of Shares or units based on Shares, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may establish performance goals in its discretion, and any such performance goals shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish performance goals, the number and/or value of Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant will depend on the extent to which such performance goals are met.
Value of Other Stock-Based Awards
10.3          .  Payment, if any, with respect to an Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, as set forth in the Award Agreement, in cash or Shares as the Committee determines.
Payment of Other Stock-Based Awards
10.4          .  The Committee shall determine the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to receive Other Stock-Based Awards following the Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, such provisions may be included in the applicable Award Agreement, but need not be uniform among all Other Stock-Based Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
11.1          .  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment shall be made in the Shares issuable or taken into account under Awards on account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued to the holders of Shares prior to issuance of such Shares under such Award. The Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award, including any Award the payment or settlement of which is deferred pursuant to Section 20.6. Dividend Equivalents may be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award becomes payable or terminates or expires. Dividend Equivalents may be subject to any limitations and/or restrictions determined by the Committee. Dividend Equivalents granted with respect to Performance Units and/or Performance Shares shall only be paid when and to the extent such Award(s) are otherwise earned in accordance with their terms. Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time, and shall be paid at such times, as may be determined by the Committee.
Dividend Equivalents
12.1          .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, Full Value Awards made to Employees, Directors or Consultants shall become vested over a period of not less than three (3) years (or, in the case of vesting based upon the attainment of performance
Full Value Award Vesting Limitations
 
goals or other performance-based objectives, over a period of not less than one (1) year measured from the commencement of the period over which performance is evaluated) following the date the Award is made; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Committee may provide that such vesting restrictions may lapse or be waived upon the Participant's death, disability, retirement, any other specified Termination or the consummation of a Change of Control and (b) Full Value Awards that result in the issuance of an aggregate of up to 5% of the Shares available pursuant to Section 4.1(a) may be granted to any one or more Participants without respect to such minimum vesting provisions.
13.1          .  No ISO or Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or in accordance with Section 13.3. Further, all ISOs and Tandem SARs granted in connection with ISOs granted to a Participant shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.
Transferability of Incentive Stock Options
13.2          .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5 or Section 13.3 or a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee, no Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided that the Committee may permit further transferability, on a general or a specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability, subject to Section 13.1 and any applicable Period of Restriction; provided further, however, that no Award may be transferred for value or other consideration without first obtaining approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee, or unless the Committee decides to permit further transferability, subject to Section 13.1 and any applicable Period of Restriction, all Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan, and all rights with respect to such Awards, shall be exercisable or available during his or her lifetime only by or to such Participant. With respect to those Awards, if any, that are permitted to be transferred to another individual, references in the Plan to exercise or payment related to such Awards by or to the Participant shall be deemed to include, as determined by the Committee, the Participant's permitted transferee. In the event any Award is exercised by or otherwise paid to the executors, administrators, heirs or distributees of the estate of a deceased Participant, or such a Participant's beneficiary, or the transferee of an Award, in any such case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Agreement and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time by the Committee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Shares thereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied, as determined in the discretion of the Committee, that the person or persons exercising such Award, or to receive such payment, are the duly appointed legal representative of the deceased Participant's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof or the named beneficiary of such Participant, or the valid transferee of such Award, as applicable. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance of an Award that does not comply with this Section 13.2 shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.
All Other Awards
13.3          .  Each Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be permitted to exercise his or her Option or SAR or to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of the Participant's death before he or she fully exercises his or her Option or SAR or receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such beneficiary designation, a Participant's unexercised Option or SAR, or amounts due but remaining unpaid to such Participant, at the Participant's death, shall be exercised or paid as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Beneficiary Designation
 
14.1          .  No person shall have any rights or claims under the Plan except in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to shares of stock covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record with respect to such shares. The liability of the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate under the Plan is limited to the obligations expressly set forth in the Plan, and no term or provision of the Plan may be construed to impose any further or additional duties, obligations, or costs on the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof or the Board or the Committee not expressly set forth in the Plan. The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award, or to all Awards, or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the existence of the Plan nor anything contained in the Plan or in any Award Agreement shall be deemed to:
Rights or Claims
(a)      Give any Employee or Non-Employee Director the right to be retained in the service of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, whether in any particular position, at any particular rate of compensation, for any particular period of time or otherwise;
(b)      Restrict in any way the right of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify any Employee's employment or any Non-Employee Director's service as a Director at any time with or without Cause;
(c)      Confer on any Consultant any right of continued relationship with the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, or alter any relationship between them, including any right of the Company or an Affiliate or Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify its relationship with a Consultant;
(d)      Constitute a contract of employment or service between the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary and any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary;
(e)      Give any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant the right to receive any bonus, whether payable in cash or in Shares, or in any combination thereof, from the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, nor be construed as limiting in any way the right of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary to determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not it shall pay any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant bonuses, and, if so paid, the amount thereof and the manner of such payment; or
(f)      Give any Participant any rights whatsoever with respect to an Award except as specifically provided in the Plan and the Award Agreement.
14.2           .  Payments and other compensation received by a Participant under an Award are not part of such Participant's normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including calculating termination, indemnity, severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments under any laws, plans, contracts, policies, programs, arrangements or otherwise. No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the Plan or diminution in value of any Award or Shares purchased or otherwise received under the Plan.
No Effects on Benefits
 
15.1          .  In the event of a Change of Control, unless otherwise specifically prohibited by any applicable laws, rules or regulations or otherwise provided in any applicable Award Agreement, as in effect prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, specifically with respect to a Change of Control:
Treatment of Outstanding Awards
(a)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, that any Awards which are outstanding shall, as applicable and in whole or in part, become vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Awards be canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse and/or that any Award the payment or settlement of which was deferred under Section 20.6 or otherwise may be paid or distributed immediately prior to the Change of Control, subject to Section 17.6. Without limiting the foregoing, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, that the target payment opportunities attainable under any outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards and other Awards shall be deemed to have been fully or partially earned for any Performance Period(s), immediately prior to the effective date of the Change of Control.
(b)      In its discretion and in accordance with the terms of the Plan, provide that all or certain Awards be Assumed or Replaced. In the event that an Award is not Assumed or Replaced, or in the event of a liquidation of the Company, then such Award shall, as applicable, become fully vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Award canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse immediately prior to the Change of Control and the target payment opportunities under such outstanding Award of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire Performance Period(s) immediately prior to the Change of Control. Further, unless otherwise provided in any applicable Award Agreement, as in effect prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, if a Participant with respect to whom an Award has been Assumed or Replaced incurs a Termination, either by the Company, an Affiliate or a Subsidiary without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason (a ""), after the Change of Control, then subject to Section 15.1(b)(i) all outstanding Awards that are held by such Terminated Participant, as the case may be, shall become fully vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Award canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse immediately prior to the Change of Control.
Terminated Participant
          (i)    Notwithstanding Section 15.1(b), with respect to outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Awards, the target payment opportunities under such outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire Performance Period(s) immediately prior to the Change of Control, in each case immediately preceding, or upon the occurrence of the failure to assume or replace such Awards or upon a Termination described in Section 15.1(b) and (I) there shall be paid out to each Participant holding such an Award denominated
 
in Shares, not later than five (5) days prior to the effective date of the Change of Control, in the case of such Awards that are not Assumed or Replaced, or upon the occurrence of such Termination, in the case of a Termination described in Section 15.1(b), a number of Shares (or the equivalent Fair Market Value thereof, as determined by the Committee, in cash) based upon an assumed achievement of all relevant targeted performance goals, unless actual performance exceeds the target, in which case actual performance shall be used, and upon the length of time within the Performance Period which has elapsed prior to the Change of Control or such Termination, as the case may be, and (II) Awards denominated in cash shall be paid to the applicable Participant or Participants in cash within thirty (30) days following the effective date of the Change of Control, in the case of such Awards that are not Assumed or Replaced, or within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of such Termination, in the case of a Termination described in Section 15.1(b), with the pro-ration determined as a function of the length of time within the Performance Period which has elapsed prior to the Change of Control or Termination, as the case may be, and based on an assumed achievement of all relevant targeted performance goals, unless actual performance exceeds the target, in which case actual performance shall be used.
pro rata
pro rata
(c)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement applicable to any Award or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, that any outstanding Award shall be adjusted by substituting for each Share subject to such Award immediately prior to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control the consideration (whether stock or other securities of the surviving corporation or any successor corporation to the Company, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or that may be issuable by another corporation that is a party to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control) received in such transaction by holders of Shares for each Share held on the closing or effective date of such transaction, in which event the aggregate Option Price or Grant Price, as applicable, of the Award shall remain the same; provided, however, that if such consideration received in such transaction is not solely stock of a successor, surviving or other corporation, the Committee may provide for the consideration to be received upon exercise or payment of an Award, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely stock or other securities of the successor, surviving or other corporation, as applicable, equal in fair market value, as determined by the Committee, to the per-Share consideration received by holders of Shares in such transaction.
(d)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement applicable to any Award or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, that any outstanding Award (or portion thereof) shall be converted into a right to receive cash, on or as soon as practicable following the closing date or expiration date of the transaction resulting in the Change of Control in an amount equal to the highest value of the consideration to be received in connection with such transaction for one Share, or, if higher, the highest Fair Market Value of a Share during the thirty (30) consecutive business days immediately prior to the closing date or expiration date of such transaction, less the per-Share Option Price, Grant Price or outstanding unpaid purchase price, as applicable to the Award, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Award, or the applicable portion thereof.
(e)      The Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an Award can or cannot be exercised after, or will otherwise terminate or not terminate as of, a Change of Control.
15.2           .  No Participant shall have any right to prevent the consummation of any of the acts described in Section 4.2 or 15.1 affecting the number of Shares available to, or other entitlement of, such Participant under the Plan or such Participant's Award. Any actions or determinations of the Committee under this Article XV need not be uniform as to all outstanding Awards, nor treat all Participants identically. Notwithstanding the adjustments described in Section 15.1, in no event may any Option or SAR be exercised after ten (10) years from the date it was originally granted, and any changes to
No Implied Rights; Other Limitations
 
ISOs pursuant to this Article XV shall, unless the Committee determines otherwise, only be effective to the extent such adjustments or changes do not cause a "modification" (within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code) of such ISOs or adversely affect the tax status of such ISOs.
15.3          .   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan (but subject to the provisions of Section 15.1(h), the last sentence of Section 16.1 and Section 16.2) or any Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article XV may not be terminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change of Control to materially impair any Participant's Award theretofore granted and then outstanding under the Plan without the prior written consent of such Participant.
Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of Change of Control Provisions
16.1          .  The Board may, at any time and with or without prior notice, amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan, and the Committee may, to the extent permitted by the Plan, amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, including any Award Agreement, in each case, retroactively or prospectively; provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall be made which, without first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Company (where such approval is necessary to satisfy (i) the then-applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3, (ii) any requirements under the Code relating to ISOs, or (iii) any applicable law, regulation or rule (including the applicable regulations and rules of the SEC and any national securities exchange)), would:
Amendment, Modification, and Termination
(a)      except as is provided in Section 4.2, increase the maximum number of Shares which may be sold or awarded under the Plan;
(b)      except as is provided in Section 4.2, decrease the minimum Option Price or Grant Price requirements of Sections 6.3 and 7.2, respectively;
(c)      change the class of persons eligible to receive Awards under the Plan;
(d)      extend the duration of the Plan or the period during which Options or SARs may be exercised under Section 6.4 or 7.6, as applicable; or
(e)      otherwise require stockholder approval to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule (including the applicable regulations and rules of the SEC and any national securities exchange).
In addition, (A) no such amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan or any Award theretofore granted, including any Award Agreement, shall be made which would materially impair the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any outstanding Award without the written consent of such Participant, provided, however, that the Board may amend or alter the Plan and the Committee may amend or alter any Award, including any Agreement, either retroactively or prospectively, without the consent of the applicable Participant, (x) so as to preserve or come within any exemptions from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to the rules and releases promulgated by the SEC (including Rule 16b-3), (y) if the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion that such amendment or alteration either (I) is required or advisable for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy, comply with or meet the requirements of any law, regulation, rule or accounting standard or (II) is not reasonably likely to significantly diminish the benefits provided under such Award, or that such diminishment has been or will be adequately compensated, or (z) with respect to any Award that is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, if the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion
 
that such amendment or alteration is necessary under Section 162(m) (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder to ensure that the Awards satisfy the requirements for qualification under Code Section 162(m) and (B) except as is provided in Section 4.2, but notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, neither the Board nor the Committee may take any action: (1) to amend the terms of an outstanding Option or SAR to reduce the Option Price or Grant Price thereof, cancel an Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR with a lower Option Price or Grant Price, or that has an economic effect that is the same as any such reduction or cancellation; or (2) to cancel an outstanding Option or SAR having an Option Price or Grant Price above the then-current Fair Market Value of the Shares in exchange for cash or for the grant of another type of Award, without, in each such case, first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Company of such action.
For the avoidance of doubt, the amendment and restatement of the Plan effective as of January 31, 2012 shall not materially impair the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any Award outstanding as of January 31, 2012 without the written consent of such Participant. To the extent the Committee determines any provision of the Plan as amended and restated effective as of January 31, 2012 materially impairs the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any Award outstanding as of January 31, 2012 without such Participant's consent, the relevant provision of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to January 31, 2012 shall apply with respect to such Participant and/or Award.
16.2          .  The Board or the Committee shall make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events (including the events described in Section 4.2) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Board or the Committee determines that such adjustments are necessary to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. Any such adjustment with respect to an Award intended to be an ISO shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Board or the Committee determines otherwise. The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under the Plan.
Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
17.1          .  The Company and/or any Subsidiary or Affiliate are authorized to withhold from any Award granted or payment due under the Plan the amount of all Federal, state, local and non-United States taxes due in respect of such Award or payment and take any such other action as may be necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. The recipient of any payment or distribution under the Plan shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company, as determined in the Committee's discretion, for the satisfaction of any tax obligations that arise by reason of any such payment or distribution. The Company shall not be required to make any payment or distribution under or relating to the Plan or any Award until such obligations are satisfied or such arrangements are made, as determined by the Committee in its discretion.
Tax Withholding
17.2          .  Without limiting the generality of Section 16.1, the Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to satisfy or arrange to satisfy, in whole or in part, the tax obligations incident to an Award by: (a) electing to have the Company withhold Shares or other property otherwise deliverable to such Participant pursuant to his or her Award (provided, however, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy required Federal, state, local and non-United States withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income) and/or (b) tendering to the Company Shares owned by such Participant (or by such Participant and his or her
Withholding or Tendering Shares
 
spouse jointly) and purchased or held for the requisite period of time as may be required to avoid the Company's or the Affiliates' or Subsidiaries' incurring an adverse accounting charge, based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the payment date as determined by the Committee. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
17.3          .  The Committee may require a Participant to give prompt written notice to the Company concerning any disposition of Shares received upon the exercise of an ISO within: (i) two (2) years from the date of granting such ISO to such Participant or (ii) one (1) year from the transfer of such Shares to such Participant or (iii) such other period as the Committee may from time to time determine. The Committee may direct that a Participant with respect to an ISO undertake in the applicable Award Agreement to give such written notice described in the preceding sentence, at such time and containing such information as the Committee may prescribe, and/or that the certificates evidencing Shares acquired by exercise of an ISO refer to such requirement to give such notice.
Special ISO Obligations
17.4          .  If a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to an Award as of the date of transfer of Shares rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, such Participant shall deliver a copy of such election to the Company immediately after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have any liability or responsibility relating to or arising out of the filing or not filing of any such election or any defects in its construction.
Section 83(b) Election
17.5          .  Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax, interest, or penalties the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise, or payment of any Award under the Plan.
No Guarantee of Favorable Tax Treatment
17.6          .
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
(a)      If any Award would be considered deferred compensation as defined under Code Section 409A and would fail to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, then such Award shall be null and void; provided, however, that the Committee may permit deferrals of compensation pursuant to the terms of a Participant's Award Agreement, a separate plan, or a subplan which (in each case) meets the requirements of Code Section 409A. Additionally, to the extent any Award is subject to Code Section 409A, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Plan shall not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any distribution related to such Award, except as permitted by Code Section 409A.
(b)      Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, in no event shall any deferral under Section 20.6 be permitted if the Committee determines that such deferral would result in the imposition of additional tax under Code Section 409A.
(c)      The Committee shall not extend the period to exercise an Option or Stock Appreciation Right to the extent that such extension would cause the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to become subject to Code Section 409A. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which an NQSO may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such Option the Participant's exercise of such Option would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the Option may only be exercised to the extent the Option was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such Option first would no longer violate such laws.
 
(d)      Unless the Committee provides otherwise in an Award Agreement, each Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Performance Share, Cash-Based Award and/or Other Stock-Based Award shall be paid in full to the Participant no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month after the end of the first (1st) calendar year in which such Award is no longer subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Code Section 409A. If the Committee provides in an Award Agreement that a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Performance Share, Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award is intended to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Award Agreement shall include terms that are intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A.
(e)      No Dividend Equivalents shall relate to Shares underlying an Option or SAR unless such Dividend Equivalent rights are explicitly set forth as a separate arrangement and do not cause any such Option or SAR to be subject to Code Section 409A.
(f)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Termination that is not a Separation from Service occurs, and payment or distribution of an Award constituting deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A would otherwise be made or commence on the date of such Termination (pursuant to the Plan, the Award Agreement or otherwise), (i) the vesting of such Award shall accelerate in accordance with the Plan and the Award Agreement, (ii) such payment or distribution shall not be made or commence prior to the earliest date on which Code Section 409A permits such payment or distribution to be made or commence without additional taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A, and (iii) in the event any such payment or distribution is deferred in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (ii), such payment or distribution that would have been made prior to the deferred payment or commencement date, but for Code Section 409A, shall be paid or distributed on such earliest payment or commencement date, together, if determined by the Committee, with interest at the rate established by the Committee.
(g)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control that is not a Qualified Change of Control occurs, and payment or distribution of an Award constituting deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code would otherwise be made or commence on the date of such Change of Control (pursuant to the Plan, the Award Agreement or otherwise), (i) the vesting of such Award shall accelerate in accordance with the Plan and the Award Agreement, (ii) such payment or distribution shall not be made or commence prior to the earliest date on which Code Section 409A permits such payment or distribution to be made or commence without additional taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A, and (iii) in the event any such payment or distribution is deferred in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (ii), such payment or distribution that would have been made prior to the deferred payment or commencement date, but for Code Section 409A, shall be paid or distributed on such earliest payment or commencement date, together, if determined by the Committee, with interest at the rate established by the Committee.
(h)      Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax, interest, or penalties the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise, or payment of any Award under the Plan.
 
18.1          .
Limits of Liability
(a)      Any liability of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate to any Participant with respect to any Award shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by the Plan and the Award Agreement.
(b)      None of the Company, any Subsidiary, any Affiliate, any member of the Board or the Committee or any other person participating in any determination of any question under the Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of the Plan, shall have any liability, in the absence of bad faith, to any party for any action taken or not taken in connection with the Plan, except as may expressly be provided by statute.
(c)      Each member of the Committee, while serving as such, shall be considered to be acting in his or her capacity as a director of the Company. Members of the Board of Directors and members of the Committee acting under the Plan shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the advice of counsel and shall incur no liability except for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties.
(d)      The Committee may, with the approval of the Board, employ such attorneys and/or consultants, accountants, appraisers, brokers, agents and other persons, any of whom may be an Employee, as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate. The Committee, the Company and its officers and Directors shall be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions or valuations of any such persons. The Committee shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of such counsel or other persons.
(e)      The Company shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having relevant jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Committee or the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Option or other Award.
18.2          .  Subject to the requirements of Delaware law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Committee or of the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Article III, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of the individual's own willful misconduct or except as provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such individual may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify or hold harmless such individual.
Indemnification
 
19.1          .  All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.

Drafting Context; Captions
20.2          .
Forfeiture Events
(a)      Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall have the authority to determine (and may so provide in any Agreement) that a Participant's (including his or her estate's, beneficiary's or transferee's) rights (including the right to exercise any Option or SAR), payments and benefits with respect to any Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment (to the extent permitted by applicable law) in the event of the Participant's Termination for Cause or due to voluntary resignation; serious misconduct; violation of the Company's or a Subsidiary's or Affiliate's policies; breach of fiduciary duty; unauthorized disclosure of any trade secret or confidential information of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate; breach of applicable non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants; or other conduct or activity that is in competition with the business of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or otherwise detrimental to the business, reputation or interests of the Company and/or any Subsidiary or Affiliate; or upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the applicable Award Agreement (in any such case, whether or not the Participant is then an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant). The determination of whether a Participant's conduct, activities or circumstances are described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be made by the Committee in its good faith discretion, and pending any such determination, the Committee shall have the authority to suspend the exercise, payment, delivery or settlement of all or any portion of such Participant's outstanding Awards pending an investigation of the matter.
(b)      If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement (x) due to the material non-compliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, if a Participant knowingly or grossly negligently engaged in such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent such misconduct, or if a Participant is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Participant shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve (12)-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever just occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement, and (y) the Committee may in its discretion provide that if the amount earned
 
under any Participant's Award is reduced by such restatement, such Participant shall reimburse the Company the amount of any such reduction previously paid in settlement of such Award.
20.3          .  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
Severability
20.4          .  For purposes of the Plan, a transfer of an Employee from the Company to an Affiliate or Subsidiary (or, for purposes of any ISO granted under the Plan, only a Subsidiary), or vice versa, or from one Affiliate or Subsidiary to another (or in the case of an ISO, only from one Subsidiary to another), and a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall not be deemed a Termination of the Employee for purposes of the Plan or with respect to any Award (in the case of ISOs, to the extent permitted by the Code). The Committee shall have the discretion to determine the effects upon any Award, upon an individual's status as an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant for purposes of the Plan (including whether a Participant shall be deemed to have experienced a Termination or other change in status) and upon the exercisability, vesting, termination or expiration of any Award in the case of: (a) any Participant who is employed by an entity that ceases to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary (whether due to a spin-off or otherwise), (b) any transfer of a Participant between locations of employment with the Company, an Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary or between the Company, an Affiliate or Subsidiary or between Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (c) any leave of absence of a Participant, (d) any change in a Participant's status from an Employee to a Consultant or a Non-Employee Director, or vice versa; and (e) upon approval by the Committee, any Employee who experiences a Termination but becomes employed by a partnership, joint venture, corporation or other entity not meeting the requirements of an Affiliate or Subsidiary, subject, in each case, to the requirements of Code Section 422 applicable to any ISOs and Code Section 409A applicable to any Options and SARs.
Transfer, Leave of Absence
20.5          .  An Award shall be deemed exercised or claimed when the Secretary of the Company or any other Company official or other person designated by the Committee for such purpose receives appropriate written notice from a Participant, in form acceptable to the Committee, together with payment of the applicable Option Price, Grant Price or other purchase price, if any, and compliance with Article XVI, in accordance with the Plan and such Participant's Award Agreement.
Exercise and Payment of Awards
20.6          .  To the extent provided in the Award Agreement, the Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the lapse or waiver of the Period of Restriction or other restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or the payment or satisfaction of Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral election is required or permitted, (a) such deferral shall represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company and shall not confer the rights of a stockholder unless and until Shares are issued thereunder; (b) the number of Shares subject to such deferral shall, until settlement thereof, be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4.2; and (c) the Committee shall establish rules and procedures for such deferrals and payment or settlement thereof, which may be in cash, Shares or any combination thereof, and such deferrals may be governed by the terms and conditions of any deferred compensation plan of the Company or Affiliate specified by the Committee for such purpose.
Deferrals
20.7          .  The Company may, in the discretion of the Committee, extend one or more loans to Participants in connection with the exercise or receipt of an Award granted to any such Participant; provided, however, that the Company shall not extend loans to any Participant if prohibited by law or the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Company's securities are listed. The terms and conditions of any such loan shall be established by the Committee.
Loans
 
20.8          .  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor anything contained herein shall affect any other compensation or incentive plans or arrangements of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or prevent or limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for their directors, officers, eligible employees or consultants or grant or assume options or other rights otherwise than under the Plan.
No Effect on Other Plans
20.9          .  Unless otherwise stated in the Award Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award granted to an Insider shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b-3) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule, and the Plan and the Award Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such limitations.
Section 16 of Exchange Act
20.10          .
Requirements of Law; Limitations on Awards
(a)      The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
(b)      If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration and/or qualification of Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state, Federal or non-United States law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares hereunder, the Company shall have no obligation to allow the grant, exercise or payment of any Award, or to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under the Plan, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent and/or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
(c)      If at any time counsel to the Company shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of Shares pursuant to an Award is or may be in the circumstances unlawful or result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate under the statutes, rules or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act, or otherwise with respect to Shares or Awards and the right to exercise or payment of any Option or Award shall be suspended until, in the opinion of such counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful or will not result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.
(d)      Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 20.10(d), any Award affected by such suspension which shall not then have expired or terminated shall be reinstated as to all Shares available before such suspension and as to the Shares which would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no suspension shall extend the term of any Award.
(e)      The Committee may require each person receiving Shares in connection with any Award under the Plan to represent and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring such Shares for investment without a view to the distribution thereof, and/or provide such other representations and agreements as the Committee may prescribe. The Committee, in its absolute discretion, may impose such restrictions on the ownership and transferability of the Shares purchasable or otherwise receivable by any person under any Award as it deems appropriate. Any such restrictions shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, and the certificates evidencing such shares may include any legend that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any such restrictions.
 
(f)      An Award and any Shares received upon the exercise or payment of an Award shall be subject to such other transfer and/or ownership restrictions and/or legending requirements as the Committee may establish in its discretion and may be referred to on the certificates evidencing such Shares, including restrictions under applicable Federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed and/or traded, and under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.
20.11          .  By accepting any benefit under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through any such Participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated their acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any action taken under the Plan by the Board, the Committee or the Company, in any case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Participants Deemed to Accept Plan
20.12          .  Except as to matters concerning the issuance of Shares or other matters of corporate governance, which shall be determined, and related Plan and Award provisions, which shall be construed, under the laws of Delaware, the Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, Participants are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of the State of California, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or any related Award Agreement.
Governing Law
20.13          .  The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the issuance of Shares or the payment of cash upon exercise or payment of any Award. Proceeds from the sale of Shares pursuant to Options or other Awards granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company.
Plan Unfunded
20.14          .  To the extent that the Plan provides for issuance of certificates to reflect the transfer of Shares, the transfer of such Shares may nevertheless be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.
Uncertificated Shares
20.15          .  An Option or other Award shall not be exercisable with respect to a fractional Share or the lesser of fifty (50) shares or the full number of Shares then subject to the Option or other Award. No fractional Shares shall be issued upon the exercise or payment of an Option or other Award.
No Fractional Shares
20.16          .  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws or practices of countries other than the United States in which the Company, any Affiliate, and/or any Subsidiary operates or has Employees, Non-Employee Directors or Consultants, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to:
Participants Based Outside of the United States
(a)      Determine which Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan;
(b)      Determine which Employees, Non-Employee Directors and/or Consultants outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan;
(c)      Grant Awards (including substitutes for Awards), and modify the terms and conditions of any Awards, on such terms and conditions as the Committee determines necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by individuals otherwise eligible to so participate who are non-United States nationals or employed outside the United States, or otherwise to comply with applicable non-United States laws or conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside the United States;
 
(d)      Establish subplans and adopt or modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable. Any subplans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures established under this Section 20.16(d) by the Committee shall be attached to the Plan as appendices; and
(e)      Take any action, before or after an Award is made, that the Committee, in its discretion, deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approvals.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate any applicable law.

On February 7, 2012, Visa Inc.

Under the terms of the Plan, this resulted in the decrease in the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock from 0.4881 to .4254, effective as of December 29, 2011. Therefore, the number of as-converted class B common shares was reduced by 15,381,045 from 119,833,888 to 104,452,843. The deposit and price-per-share calculations were conducted in accordance with the Company's certificate of incorporation using the volume-weighted average price over the 30-day pricing period from December 22, 2011, through February 6, 2012.

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results and Authorizes New $500 Million Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal first quarter 2012 ended December 31, 2011. Net income for the quarter was $1.0 billion, or $1.49 per share of diluted class A common stock, an increase of 21% over the prior year. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common stock outstanding was 690 million.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 8, 2012
Net operating revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $2.5 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year and driven by strong double-digit growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards quarterly net operating revenues.
"Visa's core businesses drove a strong start to fiscal 2012. We achieved solid financial and operational performance as we continued to benefit from the secular shift to electronic payments. Consumers' desire to use our products is evident in the strong growth we see outside the U.S. and the resiliency we are seeing in the U.S. in the wake of debit regulation, said Joe Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are in the midst of executing on our strategy to address the new landscape in the United States and we are pleased with the early results of our efforts."
"
"We remain intensely focused on further growing our international business, partnering with financial institutions, merchants, technology providers and governments," said Saunders. "At the same time, we are moving forward on our innovation strategy and are working side by side with our financial institution and merchant clients to deliver the products and solutions that best drive our mutual success."
 
Fiscal First Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2011, on which fiscal first quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 13% over the prior year at $971 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2011, was a positive 11% over the prior year at $994 billion.
Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 13% for the three months ended December 31, 2011.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended December 31, 2011, were 13.6 billion, a positive 8% increase over the prior year.
Fiscal first quarter 2012 service revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 14% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $951 million. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border activity, grew 19% over the prior year to $748 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $178 million, an 11% increase over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $481 million and represent 16% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses were $929 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $7.9 billion at December 31, 2011.
Visa's effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
 
Notable Events:
Total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 16.2 million shares during the three months ended December 31, 2011, which was funded from $1.6 billion of our operating cash on hand. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $1.57 billion from our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. This deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock as it reduces the as-converted class B common stock share count. The deposit reduced by an equivalent amount funds previously allocated to the amended July 2011 share repurchase program, which had no remaining authorized funds as of December 31, 2011.
Today, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million class A share repurchase program. The authorization will be in place through February 1, 2013, and is subject to further change at the discretion of the Board.
On January 31, 2012, the Company held its 2012 annual meeting of stockholders. Stockholders approved all the proposals enumerated in the Company's proxy statement.
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on March 6, 2012, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of February 17, 2012.

Financial Outlook excludes the impact of possible non-cash revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, which could decrease the GAAP tax rate to 30 to 31%.

Item 7.01
Regulation FD Disclosure.
In anticipation of investor discussions around payments volume, cross border volume and processed transactions growth at the Credit Suisse Annual Global Services Conference, Visa is providing selected data for February 2012.
For the month of February 2012, U.S. aggregate payments volume growth was positive 10% versus the prior year period. Further broken down, U.S. credit payments volume growth was positive 15% and debit payments volume growth was positive 7%. February cross border volume growth on a constant dollar basis was 20% over the prior year period. February processed transactions grew positively 11% globally.
Adjusting for the additional leap day in 2012 to compare the same number of days in the prior year, for the month of February 2012, U.S. aggregate payments volume growth was positive 6%. Further broken down, U.S. credit payments volume growth was positive 11% and debit payments volume growth was positive 4%. On a similar adjusted basis, February cross border volume growth on a constant dollar basis was 16% over the prior year period. February processed transactions grew positively 8% globally.
In February, the state of California granted final approval to proposed changes to the state tax law, which will allow us to begin recording a lower state tax rate beginning in our second fiscal quarter. We will also record a one-time catch-up in the second fiscal quarter to reflect this change retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year and a non-cash adjustment to revalue our deferred tax liabilities. This change will allow us to report an effective tax rate for the fiscal six months to date more in line with our annual financial guidance, which calls for an adjusted annual rate of 33% to 34%. This adjusted rate excludes the impact of the one-time, non-cash revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities. On a GAAP basis we anticipate recording an effective tax rate for the second fiscal quarter in the high teens.
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 32.6%.

These statements can be identified by the terms "continue," "could," "may," "potential," and similar references to the future.

By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of future performance and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements because of a variety of factors, including the following:

Adjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share
US $ in millions, except per share data
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the state of California approved certain changes to its state tax apportionment rules, effective retroactively to the beginning of fiscal 2012, which lowered our overall state tax rate. As a result, in our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2012, we recorded a one-time, non-cash benefit of $208 million resulting from the remeasurement of our existing net deferred tax liabilities primarily associated with $11 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets previously recorded to reflect our reorganization in 2007. This adjustment has no cash impact to us. Management therefore believes that the resulting net income recorded is not indicative of Visa's financial performance in the current or future periods. Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods.
 
 
 
Adjusted Effective Tax Rate
As discussed on the previous page, during the three months ended March 31, 2012, we recorded a one-time, non-cash benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our existing net deferred tax liabilities. This adjustment has no cash impact to us. Management therefore believes that the resulting benefit recorded in our effective income tax rates is not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future periods. Management believes the presentation of our adjusted effective income tax rates provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for these periods.

The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Effective with the 3 months ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

On July 13, 2012, Visa Inc. (the "Company"); its wholly owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa USA") and Visa International Service Association; MasterCard Incorporated; MasterCard International Incorporated; various U.S. financial institution defendants; and the Class Plaintiffs (as defined below) signed a memorandum of understanding (the "MOU") which, subject to certain conditions described below, obligates the parties to enter into a settlement agreement in the form attached to the MOU (together with the MOU, the "Settlement Agreement") to resolve the claims of the class plaintiffs (the "Class Plaintiffs") in the matter styled (the "Multi-District Litigation"). The claims originally were brought by a class of U.S. retailers in 2005.
In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, No. 05-MD-1720 (JG) (JO)
The settlement agreement for the Class Plaintiffs includes, among other terms:
 
 
 
 
 
A final settlement agreement is subject to conditions, including (a) requisite corporate approvals, (b) reaching agreement on certain appendices to the Settlement Agreement regarding class notice, claims, and other procedures, (c) reaching negotiated settlements with the individual plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated with the Multi-District Litigation for pre-trial proceedings (the "Individual Plaintiffs'), and (d) court approval. There can be no assurances that negotiated settlements can be reached with the Individual Plaintiffs or that the other conditions will be satisfied. A copy of the Settlement Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and this description is qualified entirely by reference to the Settlement Agreement.
 
The Company and the Individual Plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs claims against the Company. The agreement in principle must be reduced to a written settlement agreement that is agreeable to all parties, and that settlement agreement will be subject to customary conditions, including all requisite corporate approvals. Until this agreement in principle is reduced to a written settlement agreement and the appropriate conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the agreement in principle.
For the quarter ending June 30, 2012, the Company intends to record a litigation charge of approximately $4.1 billion, which will increase its total FAS 5 reserve for the litigation covered by the Retrospective Responsibility Plan from $285 million to approximately $4.4 billion, to reflect the Class Plaintiffs Settlement Agreement and management's current estimate to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims.
As previously disclosed, on February 7, 2011, the Company entered into the Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Judgment Sharing and Settlement Sharing, among the Company, Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated and various financial institutions (the "Omnibus Agreement"). A summary of the Omnibus Agreement is contained in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 7, 2012. A copy of that agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
On July 13, 2012, the Company issued a media release announcing that it had entered into the MOU with the Class Plaintiffs and reached agreement in principle with the Individual Plaintiffs. A copy of the media release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. All information in the media release is furnished but not filed.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the terms "will," "intend," "subject to" and similar references to the future. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about the settlements in the Multi-District Litigation with the Class Plaintiffs and the Individual Plaintiffs and our litigation reserves. By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of future performance and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements because of a variety of factors, including our failure to satisfy the conditions necessary to make the settlements effective and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Unless required to do so by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statement because of new information or future developments or otherwise.

Payments to the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
9. The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that the Total Cash Payment Amount shall be $6,050,000,000.
10. Within ten business days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, (a) the Visa Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), from the litigation escrow account established under the Visa Defendants' Retrospective Responsibility Plan, two-thirds of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $4,033,333,333), and (b) the MasterCard Defendants and Bank Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) a total of one-third of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $2,016,666,667) in accordance with the agreement among themselves regarding their respective shares.
11. If this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated prior to the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make a Default Interchange Payment by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s). Those Default Interchange Payments shall be made within sixty days after the completion of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated during the eight-month period. If this Class Settlement Agreement terminates during the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, within sixty days of such termination,
 
the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make their respective Default Interchange Payment based only on the portion of the eight-month period that preceded the date of termination. In the event of a termination of this Class Settlement Agreement after the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, any Default Interchange Payments made to the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) by the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall be distributed in a manner determined by the Court, if the parties do not enter into a new Class Settlement Agreement addressing such distribution, and in no event shall those Default Interchange Payments revert to the Visa Defendants or MasterCard Defendants or be distributed to Bank Defendants.
12. The Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the Visa Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same date of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier or, if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the Visa Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants. The Visa Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default
 
Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the Visa Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any Visa-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the Visa Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
13. The Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the MasterCard Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same day of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier, or if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the MasterCard Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants. The MasterCard Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the MasterCard Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for
 
MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any MasterCard-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the MasterCard Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
14. Class Plaintiffs reserve their rights to seek appropriate relief from the Court in the event the payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above are not timely made, including but not limited to relief consisting of immediate payment, interest, and penalties.
15. The payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above shall exhaust and fully satisfy any and all payment obligations under this Class Settlement Agreement of the Defendants and any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties, and shall extinguish entirely any further obligation, responsibility, or liability to pay any notice expenses, attorneys' fees, litigation costs, costs of administration, Taxes, settlement sums, or sums of any kind to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), or to the Class Plaintiffs or other members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class (other than those who opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class), or to any of their respective counsel, experts, advisors, agents, and representatives, all of whom shall look solely to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) for settlement and satisfaction of all claims released in this Class Settlement Agreement.
Payments from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
16. Prior to the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of
 
paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs, including the costs of the Notice Plan and the exclusion procedures for Opt Outs as provided in Paragraphs 79-93 below, and additional costs for claims administration, in amounts consistent with the limitations of Paragraph 21(c) below.
17. Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 18-20 below, in the amounts stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, regardless of any appeal or other challenge made to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments or their amount. In the event of any appeal concerning the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, and which results in a order determining that those amounts should be modified, within ten business days after the Settlement Final Date the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall pay any amounts to be refunded by wire transfer to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), and the Escrow Agents(s) shall pay any increased amounts due to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants into an account that they shall designate.
18. Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class
 
Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
19. Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
20. In the event that the sum of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments as calculated in Paragraphs 18 and 19 above would exceed twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000), and Defendants do not elect to terminate this Class Settlement Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 97 below, the payments under Paragraphs 18 and 19 above instead shall be calculated as provided in this Paragraph 20. The payment under Paragraph 18 to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (w) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 18(a) by the sum of the sales described in
 
Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (x) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. The payment under Paragraph 19 to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (y) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 19(a) by the sum of the sales described in Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (z) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. Prior to such payments, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants will disclose in writing to Class Counsel the amount of those two payments, which when added together must be equal to twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000).
21. From the Settlement Final Approval Date to the date twenty business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 17-20 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in amounts approved by the Court for (a) the costs of maintaining or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), (b) Expense Awards in an amount not to exceed a collective total of $30 million, and (c) further approved Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
22. The Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above may be paid only to the law firms that are Class Counsel, which law firms may further disseminate such funds to other law firms representing plaintiffs in the Class Actions, but subject to the terms of this Paragraph. In the event that any Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above are overturned or reduced on any appeal or otherwise, or in the event this
 
Class Settlement Agreement is terminated by the date ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, each Class Counsel law firm that received such Expense Awards (whether those Awards were retained or dissemination to other law firms) shall, within ten business days of receiving notice thereof, refund all overturned Expense Awards, or the amount by which any Expense Awards were reduced, to those Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), with interest thereon for the period from payment to refund at the same rate as earned on the funds deposited into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), the basis for which rate shall be disclosed to Defendants Any Class Counsel law firm that receives Expense Awards pursuant to Paragraph 21(b) above agrees that it, and each member or shareholder of that law firm, is jointly and severally liable solely for the amount of the Expense Awards that the Class Counsel law firm received and that must be refunded (whether those Awards were retained or disseminated to other law firms), are subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court for the enforcement of the obligation to make such refunds, and are liable for any attorneys' fees and costs that Defendants incur in recovering any such funds that must be refunded, and that the release provided to that law firm in Paragraphs 37 and 73 below shall not extend to any claims regarding such refunds.
.
23. Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, if this Class Settlement Agreement has not been terminated, and subject to the approval of the Court, the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) may be used for paying Attorney Fee Awards, Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and Expense Awards not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above, as approved by the Court.
24. Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the payments provided in Paragraphs 16-23 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) in amounts approved by the Court
 
based on applications filed with the Court and served on the Defendants, including for paying (a) the timely and proper claims of Authorized Cash Claimants pursuant to the Plan of Administration and Distribution approved by the Court, and (b) Settlement Administration Costs not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above that are approved by the Court.
25. Until ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
26. Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Interchange Accounts in amounts approved by the Court based on applications filed with the Court and served on Defendants, including for paying the timely and proper claims of members of Authorized Interchange Claimants pursuant to the Plan of Administration and Distribution approved by the Court.
27. Notwithstanding anything in Paragraphs 6-26 above, in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated as provided in Paragraphs 96-98 below, the Escrow Agent(s) shall promptly pay two-thirds of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and already paid or incurred, to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, and shall promptly pay one-third of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any
 
Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and paid or incurred, to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate.
Consideration Provided to Members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class
28. Members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class shall receive money payments from the Net Cash Settlement Fund  i.e., the amounts deposited into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) by virtue of the payment of the Total Cash Payment Amount, as reduced by the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments and other payments permitted under Paragraphs 16-24 above  pursuant to the claims process specified in the Plan of Administration and Distribution attached as Appendix I hereto, which Class Plaintiffs will propose to the Court in moving for preliminary approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, and as later or otherwise modified and ordered by the Court.

(whether made in one or more distributions), any Taxes or administrative expenses incurred by the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Accounts, any Attorneys' Fee Awards, any Expense Awards, any Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and any additional costs and expenses incurred by Class Counsel for the benefit of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and approved by the Court, Class Counsel shall make an application to the Court, with notice to Defendants, for such sums to be used to make payments for the benefit of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.

34.

35.

36. For avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Class Settlement Agreement releases any claim of a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on:
(a) breach of this Class Settlement Agreement;
(b) standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty, misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 31-35 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or
 
any other Rule fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 31-35 above; or
(c) the claims alleged in the currently operative complaints against the current defendants in (i) , No. 11-CV-02075-RJL (D.D.C.), and (ii) , No. 04-CV-02676-CRB (N.D. Cal) (including claims that have been asserted to have been alleged in the Second Amended and Third Amended Complaints against Bank of America, N.A.).

In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
37. Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party further releases each of the Visa Defendants, MasterCard Defendants, and Bank Defendants and their counsel and experts in this Action from any claims relating to the defense of this Action, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement. Each Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Class Plaintiffs, the other plaintiffs in the Class Actions, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement.
38. In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 below, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 31-37 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.
 
Consideration Provided to Members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class
39. Members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall receive no money payments, but shall receive relief as set forth below.
Visa Rules Modifications
40.

(NGG) (RER), a copy of which is attached as Appendix I, and shall maintain at no cost in the United States, consistent with the terms of the Final Judgment, the Visa Product Eligibility Service described in the Declaration of Judson Reed filed on June 14, 2011 in that action, subject to any subsequent modifications thereto in that action. In the event that the obligations imposed on the Visa Defendants in that Final Judgment are terminated in that action before July 20, 2021, those obligations shall thenceforth be imposed on the Visa Defendants under this Class Settlement Agreement in this Action but only until July 20, 2021.
United States v. American Express Co., et al.
41. Commencing sixty days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, the Visa Defendants will permit a merchant to decline acceptance of all "Visa POS Debit Devices" or all "Other Visa Products," as defined pursuant to Visa's settlement agreement in the , No. 96-CV-05238 (E.D.N.Y.) (JG) (JO), at all outlets that operate under the same trade name or banner in the United States, even if that merchant accepts all "Visa POS Debit Devices or all "Other Visa Products" at outlets that operate under a different trade name or banner within or outside of the United States. Nothing herein shall prevent the Visa Defendants from retaining or promulgating rules that require a merchant, (a) to the extent that the merchant accepts "Visa POS Debit Devices" at any of the merchant's outlets
In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation
 
operating under a given trade name or banner in the United States, to accept "Visa POS Debit Devices" at all outlets operating under that trade name or banner, or (b) to the extent that the merchant accepts "Other Visa Products" at any of the merchant's outlets operating under a given trade name or banner in the United States, to accept "Other Visa Products" at all outlets operating under that trade name or banner. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Visa Defendants from (a) using volume-based pricing and pricing incentives, or (b) contracting with an individual merchant, including for more favorable pricing, based on its acceptance at all outlets in the United States; provided, however, that the Visa Defendants shall not require merchant acceptance at all outlets in connection with a volume-based incentive program made generally available to all merchants in the United States.
42. Within sixty days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, the Visa Defendants shall modify their "no surcharge" rules to permit a merchant in the United States to surcharge Visa-Branded Credit Card Transactions at either (but not both) the "Brand Level" or the "Product Level," as defined below in this Paragraph 42 and subject to the terms and conditions in this Paragraph 42.
(a) : A permitted Brand Level Surcharge is one in which:
Brand Level Surcharging
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As used in this Paragraph 42(a):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) : A permitted Product Level Surcharge is one in which:
Product Level Surcharging
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As used in this Paragraph 42(b):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) : A merchant's ability to apply either a Brand Level or Product Level Surcharge is conditioned on the merchant's agreement to abide by the following disclosure requirements. A merchant must:
Merchant Surcharging Disclosure Requirements
 
 
 
 
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Class Settlement Agreement, including Paragraph 42, shall preclude the Visa Defendants from maintaining their prohibition of surcharging at the issuer level, i.e., adding surcharges that are not the same, after accounting for any discounts or rebates offered by a merchant at the point of sale, for all Visa Credit Cards or all Visa Credit Cards of a given product type, regardless of the issuing financial institution; and it is expressly agreed for the purpose of clarity that any claim relating to the past, continued, or future prohibition of such surcharging is within the scope of the Releases and Covenants Not to Sue set forth in Paragraphs 31-38 and 66-74.
(e) The Visa Defendants shall modify any other rules as necessary to ensure that the changes set forth in Paragraph 42(a) above are also applicable to merchants located in all United States territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(f) Nothing in this Class Settlement Agreement shall prevent the Visa Defendants from contracting with merchants not to surcharge Visa-Branded Credit Cards or any Product type of Visa-Branded Credit Card as long as (i) the agreement is for a fixed duration, (ii) is not subject to an evergreen clause, (iii) is individually negotiated with the merchant or merchants organized in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 43 below and is not a standard agreement or part of a standard agreement generally by the Visa Defendants, and (iv) any such agreement or waiver is supported by Independent Consideration; provided, however, that nothing in this agreement shall affect any right of the Visa Defendants to limit or decline acceptance of Visa by a payment aggregator or payment services provider with a proprietary acceptance mark that surcharges or discriminates against Visa.
 
(g) In the event that Visa debit card transactions are no longer subject to the rate cap established by Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  1693o-2 and its implementing regulations or any other regulated rate cap that may be subsequently implemented, the Visa Defendants will further modify the Visa rules to permit merchants to surcharge Visa debit card transactions in a manner equivalent to that permitted for Visa Credit Card transactions pursuant to Paragraph 42(a) above.
43.

and it is expressly agreed, for purposes of clarity, without expanding or limiting the foregoing, that any claims based on or relating to (a)-(i) above are claims that were or could have been alleged in this Action.
Provided, however, that any Opt Out that is also a member of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall not be deemed to have released any claims for damages based on any
 
Rules or other conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party prior to the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order.
69. Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further expressly and irrevocably waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles and releases, any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party may have or that may be derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the release contained in the preceding Paragraphs 66-68. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party expressly and irrevocably waives and releases any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party might otherwise have in relation to the release by virtue of the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or similar laws of any other state or jurisdiction.

different, or additional facts. Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall be deemed by operation of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Class Settlement Agreement.
70. Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party covenants and agrees that it shall not, hereafter, seek to establish, or permit another to act for it in a representative capacity to seek to establish, liability against any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties based, in whole or in part, upon any conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-69 above.
71. For purposes of clarity, it is specifically intended for the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-70 above to preclude all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class from seeking or obtaining any form of declaratory, injunctive, or equitable relief, or damages or other monetary relief relating to the period after the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order with respect to any Rule of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant, and the compliance by any Bank Defendant with any such Rule, as it is alleged to exist, now exists, may be modified in the manner provided in Paragraphs 40-45 and 53-57 above, or may in the future exist in the same or substantially similar form thereto.
72. For avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Class Settlement Agreement releases any claim of a Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on:
(a) breach of this Class Settlement Agreement;
(b) standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty,
 
misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 66-71 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or any other Rule, fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-71 above;
(c) the claims alleged in the currently operative complaints against the current defendants in (i) , No. 11-CV-02075-RJL (D.D.C.), and (ii) , No. 04-CV-02676-CRB (N.D. Cal) (including claims that have been asserted to have been alleged in the Second Amended or Third Amended Complaints against Bank of America, N.A.); or
NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
(d) a claim seeking only injunctive relief against only the Visa Defendants regarding the legality of Visa's Fixed Acquirer Network Fee.
73. Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further releases each of the Visa Defendants, MasterCard Defendants, and Bank Defendants and their counsel and experts in this Action from any claims relating to the defense of this Action, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement. Each Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Class Plaintiffs, other plaintiffs in the Class Actions, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions,
 
including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement.
74. In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 below, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-73 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.

91. The Class Administrator's expenses for the foregoing notice and exclusion activities, including those of any third-party vendors it uses to perform tasks necessary for the implementation or effectuation of its duties, shall be paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s). In no event shall any Defendant, Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party, or

92. Class Counsel may, upon notice to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class in the manner approved by the Court, seek Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards.

Class Counsel reserve the right to make additional applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards for fees and expenses incurred after the Preliminary Approval Date, including for achieving the Settlement Final Approval Date and Settlement Final Date, and for the administration of this Class Settlement Agreement. Class Counsel shall allocate any Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards among counsel for the Class Plaintiffs and counsel for other plaintiffs in the Class Actions in a manner which they in good faith believe reflects the contribution of those counsel to the prosecution and settlement of the Class Actions in this Action.
93. The Court may consider any applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards separately from a motion for preliminary or final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, and may enter orders regarding such applications separately from the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment. Any rehearing, reconsideration, vacation, review, appeal, or any other action taken regarding only a separate order concerning only an application for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and not in
 
any way concerning the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, shall not delay the Settlement Final Date that otherwise would occur with respect to the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.

1. . For the purposes of this Omnibus Agreement, "Interchange Litigation" refers to (i) the putative class actions (the "Class Action") in , Case No. 1:05-md-1720-JG-JO ("MDL 1720"); (ii) the actions by individual plaintiffs that as of the Effective Date have been transferred to MDL 1720 for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings (the "Individual Plaintiff Actions"); (iii) any action by one or more of the entities listed on Attachment 1, or by their direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns, or affiliates, that assert claims against one or more Signatories, or their respective parents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns or affiliates, similar to those asserted in the Individual Plaintiff Actions and are commenced on or before the last date on which Settlements or Final Judgments have occurred in all of the Individual Plaintiff Actions ("Subsequent Individual Plaintiff Actions"); and (iv) any action other than those within (i), (ii), and (iii) above in this paragraph that falls within definitions 4(i), 4(ii), or 5 of Schedule A to the Visa LSA, or that challenges the agreements leading up to or the consummation of the MasterCard initial public offering and is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time after the Effective Date to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time after the Effective Date in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction ("Opt-Out Actions").

Definition of Interchange Litigation
In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
2. . The Signatories agree that, for the purposes of the interpretation, application, coordination, and administration of the Sharing Agreements, certain payment obligations for the purposes of judgment sharing or settlement sharing shall be calculated in accordance with the following provisions:
Visa/MasterCard Allocation
a. . In the event of either (i) a Settlement (as defined in Paragraph 5 below) of all claims in the Class Action that is agreed to by all Signatories (with the exception of any Signatory that has entered into a Partial Settlement (as defined in Paragraph 5(a) below) of, or has otherwise received a release of, all claims asserted against it in the Class Action), or (ii) a Settlement by an Individual Plaintiff (other than an Individual Plaintiff in an Opt-Out Action) of all claims that it asserts in each and every action in the Interchange Litigation and that is agreed to by all Signatories (with the exception of any Signatory that has entered into a Partial Settlement of, or has otherwise received a release of, all claims asserted against it by that Individual Plaintiff) (each of the foregoing constituting a "Joint Settlement"), then, that in such Joint Settlement all Claimants that participate in such Settlement provide a full release of all Signatories that have not (x) entered into Partial Settlement(s) of all claims asserted against them by such Claimants or (y) otherwise previously been released from all claims by such Claimants, in all events including an Effective Release (as defined in this subparagraph below) of at least one Signatory
Settlement Sharing
provided
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
agreeing to the Joint Settlement other than MasterCard or Visa, each Signatory's "Settlement-Sharing Payment Obligation" with respect to the Monetary Portion (as defined in Paragraph 5 below) of such a settlement shall be calculated as follows: (a) the total value of the Monetary Portion of the Joint Settlement shall be divided into a "MasterCard Portion" and a "Visa Portion" using the following percentages (the "Visa/MasterCard Allocation"): MasterCard Portion: 33.3333%, and Visa Portion: 66.6667%; (b) the MasterCard Portion of the Joint Settlement shall be allocated among the Signatories according to the applicable provisions of the MasterCard SJSA; and (c) the Visa Portion of the Joint Settlement shall be allocated among the Signatories in accordance with Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the Visa LSA and treated as a "Visa Litigation Obligation" under the Visa LSA and as being exclusive of any "JSA MasterCard Portion" as that term is used in Section 3 of the Visa LSA, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Visa LSA or the Visa JSA (including without limitation Paragraph 12 of the Visa JSA, which shall be deemed to be superseded by this Agreement). For purposes of this subsection, a Claimant provides an "Effective Release" to a Signatory when (x) that Signatory has not already entered into a Partial Settlement with, or otherwise received a release of any claims from, that Claimant and (y) the Claimant releases such Signatory from all MasterCard-Related Claims and all Visa-Related Claims, that no release of Visa-Related Claims shall be required as to MasterCard and no release of MasterCard-Related Claims shall be required as to Visa. For the further avoidance of doubt, (xx) the Signatories expressly agree that MasterCard's payment obligation with respect to the Visa Portion of any Joint Settlement shall be 0.00% and Visa's payment obligation with respect to the MasterCard Portion of any Joint Settlement shall be 0.00%, and (yy) the Signatories hereto that are also parties to the Visa LSA expressly agree that all payments by a Signatory toward or with respect to the MasterCard Portion of any Joint Settlement shall be treated under the Visa LSA as payments with respect to and in satisfaction of the "JSA MasterCard Portion" as that term is used in Section 3 of the Visa LSA.
provided
b. . Notwithstanding any other provision in the other Sharing Agreements, in the event one or more Signatories litigates one or more of the actions in the Interchange Litigation to a Final Judgment (as defined in Paragraph 5 below) and that Final Judgment results in a Monetary Award (as defined in Paragraph 5 below), the Signatories agree that each Signatory's payment obligation with respect to such Monetary Award (as to each Signatory, its "Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation") shall be as follows:
Judgment Sharing
i. . With respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to any MasterCard-Related Claims (pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) below), each Signatory's Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation with respect to the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to the MasterCard-Related Claims shall be calculated and satisfied as provided in the MasterCard SJSA. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Visa LSA or the Visa JSA, (i) the Signatories expressly agree that Visa's Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation with respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to MasterCard-Related Claims shall be 0.00%, and (ii) the Signatories hereto that are also parties to the Visa LSA expressly agree that all payments by a Signatory pursuant to this Paragraph 2(b)(i)
MasterCard-Related Claims
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
of this Omnibus Agreement, or toward or with respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to MasterCard-Related Claims, shall be treated under the Visa LSA as payments with respect to and in satisfaction of the "JSA MasterCard Portion" as that term is used in Section 3 of the Visa LSA.
ii. . With respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to any Visa-Related Claims (pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) below), each Signatory's Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation with respect to the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to the Visa-Related Claims shall be calculated and satisfied according to the procedure set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(i)-2(a)(iii) of the Visa JSA as though the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) were the "Visa Portion" collected from signatories under the Visa JSA and the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) shall be treated as though it were a "Visa Litigation Obligation" under the Visa LSA, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Visa JSA or the Visa LSA. For the avoidance of doubt, the Signatories expressly agree that (x) MasterCard's Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation with respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to Visa-Related Claims shall be 0.00%, and (y) no Signatory to the Visa JSA and Visa LSA which complies with its obligations under this Omnibus Agreement shall be required, under either the Visa JSA or the Visa LSA, to pay any "MasterCard Portion" under the Visa JSA with respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to Visa-Related Claims.
Visa-Related Claims
iii. . With respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to any Inter-Network Claims (pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) below), each Signatory's Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation with respect to the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to the Inter-Network Claims shall be calculated as follows: (i) the total value of the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to the Inter-Network Claims shall be divided into a "MasterCard Portion" and a "Visa Portion" using the Visa/MasterCard Allocation percentages set forth in Paragraph 2(a) above, and (ii) the MasterCard Portion of the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) shall be allocated among the Signatories according to the applicable provisions of the MasterCard SJSA, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Visa JSA or the Visa LSA (and the Signatories hereto that are also parties to the Visa LSA expressly agree that all payments by a Signatory toward or with respect to that MasterCard Portion of the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) shall be treated under the Visa LSA as payments with respect to and in satisfaction of the "JSA MasterCard Portion" as that term is used in Section 3 of the Visa LSA); and (iii) the Visa Portion of the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) shall be allocated among the Signatories according to the procedure set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(i)-2(a)(iii) of the Visa JSA as though it were the "Visa Portion" collected from signatories under the Visa JSA and the Monetary Award (or portion thereof) shall be treated as though it were a "Visa Litigation Obligation" under the Visa LSA, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Visa JSA or the Visa LSA. For the avoidance of doubt, the Signatories expressly agree that no Signatory to the Visa JSA and Visa LSA which complies with its obligations under this Omnibus Agreement shall be required, under either the Visa JSA or the Visa LSA, to pay any "MasterCard Portion" under the Visa JSA with respect to any Monetary Award (or portion thereof) assigned to Inter-Network Claims.
Inter-Network Claims
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
c. . For the purposes of this Agreement, amounts of a Monetary Award will be deemed to be assigned either to MasterCard-Related Claims or to Visa-Related Claims (as defined in Paragraph 5 below) to the extent the Monetary Award in some discernible manner assigns amounts solely to conduct of or participation in the MasterCard payment system or solely to conduct of or participation in the Visa payment system (respectively). In all other events, amounts of a Monetary Award will be deemed to be assigned to Inter-Network Claims. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing language in Paragraph 2(c), and not withstanding any contrary provision in the MasterCard SJSA, Visa JSA or Visa LSA, if a plaintiff in an Opt-Out Action against MasterCard does not bring an Opt-Out Action against Visa and Visa has not provided any consideration for not being named in an Opt-Out Action by that plaintiff, all amounts of a Monetary Award in that Opt-Out Action that are not assigned to Visa-Related Claims pursuant to the first sentence of this Paragraph 2(c) shall be deemed to be assigned to MasterCard-Related Claims, and if a plaintiff in an Opt-Out Action against Visa does not bring an Opt-Out Action against MasterCard and MasterCard has not provided any consideration for not being named in an Opt-Out Action by that plaintiff, all amounts of a Monetary Award in that Opt-Out Action that are not assigned to MasterCard-Related Claims pursuant to the first sentence of this Paragraph 2(c) shall be deemed to be assigned to Visa-Related Claims.
"Assignment" of Monetary Awards to Claims
3. . The Signatories agree that, as to the Interchange Litigation, the Sharing Agreements shall be interpreted, applied and administered in order to completely cover the total value of (a) the Monetary Portion of any Joint Settlement, Settlement of MasterCard-Related Claims Only (as defined in and pursuant to the MasterCard SJSA), or settlement covered by Sections 2 and 3 of the Visa LSA, or (b) any Monetary Award in the Class Action, the Individual Plaintiff Actions, the Subsequent Individual Plaintiff Actions, or the Opt-Out Actions involving one or more Signatories to this Omnibus Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision means that, to the extent that one or more Signatories have any obligation to make any monetary payment under any settlement constituting a Joint Settlement, Settlement of MasterCard-Related Claims Only (as defined in and pursuant to the MasterCard SJSA), or settlement covered by Sections 2 and 3 of the Visa LSA or under any Final Judgment as to any claim in the Interchange Litigation, the Sharing Agreements will be interpreted, applied and administered in a manner that will, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the terms of the Sharing Agreements, result in the payment obligation being covered by the Sharing Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, Paragraph 12 of the Visa JSA shall be shall be deemed to be superseded by this Agreement in all actions in the Interchange Litigation, including Opt-Out Actions.
Complete Coverage of Interchange Litigation
4. . Nothing in this Omnibus Agreement shall be construed as precluding the authority of any Signatory to one or more of the Sharing Agreements to settle, at its sole discretion, any claims asserted against it. The Signatories intend that the Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation under this Omnibus Agreement of any Settling Signatory (as defined in Paragraph 5 below) shall be satisfied with respect to such settled claims only (i) if the Settling Signatory complies with the applicable terms and conditions of the Visa JSA, the Visa LSA, and the MasterCard SJSA (to the extent

EXECUTION COPY
 
that the Settling Signatory is a party to any such Sharing Agreement and to the extent any such Sharing Agreement may be applicable); and (ii) if the settlement agreement includes a provision (a "Setoff Provision") pursuant to which each settling Claimant agrees not to collect as a result of a judgment from any other Signatory an amount equal to the following: (a) to the extent a Claimant settles, compromises or releases any MasterCard-Related Claims against the Settling Signatory, the judgment-sharing payment obligations of the Settling Signatory with respect to MasterCard-Related Claims under all Sharing Agreements to which the Settling Signatory is a party (however those claims are described therein), (b) to the extent a Claimant settles, compromises or releases any Visa-Related Claims against the Settling Signatory, the judgment-sharing payment obligations of the Settling Signatory with respect to Visa-Related Claims under all Sharing Agreements to which the Settling Signatory is a party (however those claims are described therein), and (c) to the extent a Claimant settles, compromises or releases any Inter-Network Claims against the Settling Signatory, the judgment-sharing payment obligations of the Settling Signatory with respect to Inter-Network Claims under all Sharing Agreements to which the Settling Signatory is a party (however those claims are described therein); and (iii) if the settlement agreement includes a provision stating that the Signatories to this Omnibus Agreement, the other defendants in the Interchange Litigation, and any affiliates of the foregoing, are intended third party beneficiaries of the Setoff Provision. In the event that any Settling Signatory does not obtain such a Setoff Provision, any such Settling Signatory will continue to have the Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligations (if any) set forth in this Omnibus Agreement as to any claims for which it does not obtain such a Setoff Provision, provided, however, that with respect to a settlement in an Opt-Out Action, and notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Paragraph 4, (i) Visa need not obtain any Setoff Provision beyond that required by the Visa JSA and Visa LSA to satisfy its Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation under this Omnibus Agreement, (ii) MasterCard need not obtain any Setoff Provision beyond that required by the MasterCard SJSA to satisfy its Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation under this Omnibus Agreement, and (iii) a Signatory other than Visa or MasterCard need not obtain any Setoff Provision beyond that required by the Visa JSA and Visa LSA and the MasterCard SJSA to satisfy its Judgment-Sharing Payment Obligation under this Omnibus Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Omnibus Agreement to the contrary, payments to a Claimant by a Settling Signatory shall be deemed payments by such Settling Signatory pursuant to this Omnibus Agreement to the extent and in the amount that such payments reduce the amount of a Final Judgment with respect to any MasterCard-Related Claims, Visa-Related Claims or Inter-Network Claims that may be enforced against other Signatories. For the avoidance of doubt, the Signatories hereto that are also parties to the Visa LSA expressly agree that payments made in (or in connection with) a Partial Settlement or other settlement are subject to reimbursement under the terms of Sections 3(b)(vi) and 3(b)(vii) of the Visa LSA (i) only if such payments are part of an "Approved Settlement" as that term is used in Section 2(a)(ii) of the Visa LSA and (ii) only to the extent that such payments are not allocated in (or in connection with) the settlement to conduct of or participation in the MasterCard payment system.

Each Signatory agrees to provide notice promptly after the execution of a Partial Settlement by all parties to that agreement in accordance with the notice provision in Paragraph 22 below.
b. "Monetary Award" means the amount of any award of damages or other monetary compensation to a Claimant awarded by a court or jury in the Interchange Litigation, including any award of compensatory, punitive, treble, or other damages, court costs, attorneys' fees, or expenses, including any interest thereon, before any offset or reduction by operation of law on account of settlement payments by any Signatory that does not comply with all of the applicable terms and conditions of the Sharing Agreements to which it is also a Signatory. For the avoidance of doubt, "Monetary Award" shall not include the cost or value of any injunctive, equitable, or declaratory relief.
c. "Monetary Portion" means the money agreed to be paid in any settlement in respect of claims for compensatory, punitive, treble, or other damages, court costs, attorneys' fees, or expenses, including any interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, "Monetary Portion" shall exclude the cost or value of or any payment for any other consideration or relief provided in the settlement, including without limitation any rate, fee, marketing, or support agreements.
d. "Final Judgment" refers to a judgment (including any award of compensatory, punitive, treble, or other damages, court costs, attorneys' fees, or expenses, including any interest thereon) entered by a court upon the conclusion of a trial or summary judgment proceedings in the Interchange Litigation, or any other procedural vehicle other than a Settlement (as defined in Paragraph 5(a) above) by means of which a court enters final judgment on any Claimants' claims, which judgment (a) is immediately enforceable and has not been stayed pending appeal or (b) becomes final after exhaustion of all appeals or other judicial review or expiration of the time to obtain further judicial review.
e. "MasterCard-Related Claims" refers to any claims that are or may be asserted in the Interchange Litigation as to which MasterCard and/or some or all of the Signatory banks are alleged to be liable solely by virtue of conduct of or participation in the MasterCard payment system.

"Settling Signatory" refers to any Signatory that enters into a Partial Settlement or otherwise obtains a release or the benefit thereof (including by virtue of settlement by any of the Signatory's parents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns, affiliates or by any other Signatory, person or entity obtaining a release of the Signatory) of one or more actions or claims other than as part of a Joint Settlement.
6. . This Omnibus Agreement is made and shall be binding on and inure solely to the benefit of the Signatories and their respective direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, affiliates, or permitted assigns, but otherwise confers no rights or defenses upon any non-Signatory.

If, after the Effective Date, any person or entity, as a result of any merger, purchase of assets, reorganization or other transaction, acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of the business or assets of a Signatory (the "Acquired Signatory"), then such Acquired Signatory shall, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any such merger, purchase of assets, reorganization or other transaction, obligate in writing such acquiring person or entity to be bound by, and honor all of, the provisions of this Omnibus Agreement and shall take all necessary steps to ensure that such person or entity is bound by the same payment obligations and all other obligations of the Acquired Signatory as provided for in this Omnibus Agreement.

Visa, U.S. Retailers Resolve Claims in the Federal Multi-District Interchange Litigation
 
 
San Francisco  July 13, 2012  Visa (NYSE: V), MasterCard and U.S. financial institution defendants have signed a memorandum of understanding to enter into a settlement agreement to resolve the Class Plaintiffs' claims in the multi-district interchange litigation (MDL). The claims originally were brought by a class of U.S. retailers in 2005. Visa also has reached an agreement in principle to resolve the claims brought against Visa by a group of individual retailers (the Individual Plaintiffs) in the same MDL litigation. The proposed settlement payments for both the Class and Individual claims would be approximately $6.6 billion, of which Visa's share would represent approximately $4.4 billion. Visa's share will be paid from the litigation escrow account established pursuant to Visa's Retrospective Responsibility Plan. More information on the plan is available in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.
The settlement agreement with the Class Plaintiffs includes, among other terms:
 
 
 
 
For the quarter ending June 30, 2012, Visa intends to record a litigation charge of approximately $4.1 billion, which will increase its total FAS 5 reserve for the litigation covered by the Retrospective Responsibility Plan from $285 million to approximately $4.4 billion, to reflect the Class Plaintiffs' Settlement Agreement and management's current estimate to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims.
Additional information about these settlements can be found on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov, as soon as accepted and processed by the SEC.
"We believe settling this case is in the best interests of all parties," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "We are comfortable with the terms, which we do not anticipate will impact our current guidance. Visa is well positioned to help drive the migration to electronic payments in the U.S. and globally."
Consistent with commitments Visa made at the time of its restructuring, the settlements are subject to approval by Visa USA voting members representing two-thirds of membership proportion.
"This agreement should remove the distraction of litigation for all parties," said Joshua R. Floum, General Counsel of Visa Inc. "We will go forward with a focus on helping retailers grow their businesses and providing them with efficient and valuable payment options."
Visa remains in a "quiet period" which will extend until the Company's fiscal third quarter 2012 earnings are released on July 25, 2012.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the terms "will," "intend," and similar references to the future. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about the settlement of the multi-district interchange litigation and our litigation reserves. By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of future performance and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements because of a variety of factors, including our failure to satisfy the conditions necessary to make the settlement effective and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 13, 2012, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Unless required to do so by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statement because of new information or future developments or otherwise.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results and Authorizes New $1 Billion Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter 2012 ended June 30, 2012. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net loss of $1.8 billion, inclusive of a litigation provision of $4.1 billion, related to the previously announced settlement agreement in the Multi-District Litigation case. Visa's share will be paid from the previously funded litigation escrow account established pursuant to the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 25, 2012
Excluding the litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefit, adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, or $1.56 per diluted class A common share, an increase of 25% over the prior year on an adjusted basis. The adjusted weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding during the third quarter was 675 million. The Company's adjusted quarterly net income per share of class A common stock is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2012 was $2.6 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year and driven by strong double-digit growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. There was no significant impact on current quarter results related to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year.
"Visa once again reported solid global growth in payments volume, cross border transactions and processed transactions outside the U.S., executing on our strategy of growing the electronification of payments worldwide. We are pleased that we were able to come to a resolution in the merchant litigation which was acceptable to most parties while ensuring the long-term health of the U.S. payments industry," said Joseph Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer of Visa Inc. "As we look forward, we remain focused on launching new payment solutions and products for our financial and merchant partners and consumers, while supporting the Visa brand and the advancement of electronic payments."
 
Fiscal Third Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2012, on which fiscal third quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 11% over the prior year at $958 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2012, was a positive 6% over the prior year at $979 billion.
Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 14% for the three months ended June 30, 2012.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended June 30, 2012, were 13.1 billion, a positive 1% increase over the prior year.
Fiscal third quarter 2012 service revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 15% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 17% over the prior year to $1.0 billion. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border activity, grew 13% over the prior year to $748 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $175 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $614 million and represent 19% of gross revenues.
The Company recorded a $4.1 billion pre-tax provision, or $2.9 billion on an after-tax basis, in the fiscal third quarter of 2012. This represents the Company's financial portion in the settlement of the Multi-District Litigation case.
Excluding the litigation provision, total operating expenses increased 10% to $1.1 billion during the fiscal third quarter, primarily due to higher personnel expense and professional fees associated with investments in technology projects to support our growth initiatives.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $9.4 billion at June 30, 2012.
Excluding the litigation provision and the related tax benefit, the Company's adjusted effective tax rate was 29.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. The Company's adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
 
Notable Events:
During the three months ended June 30, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 4.0 million class A common shares, at an average price of $115.51 per share, for a total cost of $461 million.
As announced on July 13, 2012, the Company, MasterCard and U.S. financial institution defendants signed a memorandum of understanding to enter into a settlement agreement to resolve the Class Plaintiffs' claims in the Multi-District Litigation case, and announced an agreement in principle to settle with the individual plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated into the case for pre-trial purposes. The proposed settlement payments for both the Class and individual claims would be approximately $6.6 billion, of which Visa's share would represent approximately $4.4 billion. Visa's share will be paid from the litigation escrow account established pursuant to the Company's Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
As announced on July 19, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on September 4, 2012, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of August 17, 2012.
The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion class A share repurchase program. The authorization will be in place through July 2013, and is subject to further change at the discretion of the Board.
On July 24, 2012, the Company deposited $150 million into the litigation escrow account previously established under its Retrospective Responsibility Plan. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the value of the Company's class B shares  which are held by U.S. financial institutions and their affiliates and successors  is correspondingly adjusted via a reduction in the class B shareholders' as-converted share count. The $150 million deposit by the Company reduced the number of common shares outstanding on an as-converted basis from 104,452,843 to 103,257,583. The funding calculations were conducted in accordance with the Company's certificate of incorporation using the volume-weighted average price over the 3-day pricing period from July 19, 2012, through July 23, 2012. As a result of the deposit, the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock has decreased from 0.4254 to 0.4206 as of July 24, 2012.

*Financial Outlook excludes (i) the impact of the litigation provision and related tax benefit recorded in Q3 2012; and (ii) a non-cash benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities recorded in the tax provision during Q2 2012. These deferred tax liabilities are primarily associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded as part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization. Including the net impact of the litigation provision and remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities, the annual GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 30  31%.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results
US$ in millions, except margin ratio and per share data
During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a provision related to litigation subject to the retrospective responsibility plan of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits ("litigation provision adjustment"). Additionally, our reported financial results for the nine months ended June 30, 2012 benefited from a one-time non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities ("deferred tax adjustment") recorded in our income tax provision during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The deferred tax adjustment has no cash impact to us.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option ("revaluation of the Visa Europe put option"), which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. We believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the litigation provision adjustment, the deferred tax adjustment, and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the respective periods.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results
US$ in millions, except effective tax rate
The following table presents our adjusted effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2012, which excludes the impact of the covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, and the one-time, non-cash benefit, of $208 million, resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We believe the presentation of our adjusted effective income tax rates provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for these periods. We believe the covered litigation provision and the one-time non-cash adjustment to remeasure our deferred taxes recorded in our effective income tax rates are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future periods.
 
 
 
 
The tables below provide information regarding the available operational results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, as well as the prior four quarterly reporting periods and the 12 months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands.

The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Effective with the 3 months ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

Item 5.02(b), (c) and (d)
On October 24, 2012, Visa Inc. ("Visa," or the "Company") announced that Charles W. Scharf, 47, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co., has been appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, effective November 1, 2012. Mr. Scharf succeeds Joseph W. Saunders, who will remain with the Company as executive chairman during the remaining term of his employment, which expires March 31, 2013, after which the Company's board of directors intends to select an independent director as chairperson. Mr. Scharf is currently a Managing Director at One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and brings to Visa significant experience in retail banking, global financial management and as a chief executive officer, having spent nine years at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its predecessors as the Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services, one of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s six lines of business, and a major issuer of Visa-branded cards. The business generated revenue of $30 billion annually with 130,000 employees. He was previously Chief Financial Officer of Bank One Corporation from 2000 to 2002 and spent 13 years at Citigroup Inc. and its predecessor companies, serving as Chief Financial Officer for Citigroup's Global Corporate and Investment Bank prior to joining Bank One.
Mr. Scharf is intimately familiar with Visa's global payments business, having served as a director of the Company from its initial public offering in 2007 until January 2011, and as director of Visa U.S.A. from 2003 until 2007. Mr. Saunders will step down as Chief Executive Officer as of November 1, 2012, but plans to serve as the Company's executive chairman and provide transition services during the remaining term of his employment. As provided in his existing employment agreement, subject to providing the requested transition services, Mr. Saunders will continue to receive the compensation (including cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards) and other benefits to which he is entitled under that agreement until its expiration.
The press release issued by the Company announcing Mr. Scharf's appointment and Mr. Saunders's resignation as the Company's Chief Executive Officer is furnished herewith and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
On October 23, 2012, the Company extended a written offer letter to Mr. Scharf, which Mr. Scharf accepted on October 23, 2012 (the "Offer Letter"). The Offer Letter outlines the terms of his employment as Chief Executive Officer, reporting to the Company's board of directors, and pursuant to its terms, Mr. Scharf will receive an annual salary of $950,000. Mr. Scharf will also participate in the Visa Inc. Incentive Plan ("VIP") for fiscal year 2013, with a target bonus under the VIP of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of his base salary and a maximum bonus opportunity under the VIP of five hundred percent (500%) of his base salary, subject to the terms and conditions of the VIP and payable, if at all, in November 2013. In addition to participating in the VIP, Mr. Scharf will also be eligible for a long-term performance bonus. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Scharf's target long-term performance bonus value will be five hundred percent (500%) of his base salary, with actual long-term performance bonus amounts determined at the conclusion of each fiscal year based on an evaluation of both the Company's performance and his individual performance, all subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, including vesting requirements, as approved by the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company's board of directors.
The Offer Letter further provides that on November 19, 2012, Mr. Scharf will receive a make-whole equity award with a value of $19,000,000, comprised of restricted stock with a grant date value of $13,000,000 and stock options with a grant date value of $6,000,000 (collectively, the "Make-Whole Award"), in each case with the number of shares of Visa common stock subject to such grants being determined by the Compensation Committee based on the "fair value" of each grant type as determined by Visa under the applicable accounting standards. The Make-Whole Award, which will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and the applicable individual award agreements, shall be immediately vested as of the date of grant with respect to that number of restricted shares having a grant date value of $4,447,368 and that number of stock options having a grant date value of $2,052,632. The remainder of the Make-Whole Award shall vest in three substantially equal installments on each of the three anniversaries of the date of grant, assuming Mr. Scharf's continued employment by Visa through each such date, but subject to 12 months acceleration upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination of employment at any time following the first anniversary of the grant of date (and conditioned upon the execution
 
and nonrevocation of a release of claims by Mr. Scharf), in which case all vested Make-Whole Award stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the ten-year term from their date of grant.
If during the period from the date Mr. Scharf commences employment with the Company through November 19, 2012, Mr. Scharf experiences a qualifying termination of employment, is disabled or dies, the Company will pay him (or his estate, as applicable) a lump sum amount of $6,500,000 on the 60
th
day following such event, conditioned upon the execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims by Mr. Scharf or his estate, as applicable.
Visa will assist Mr. Scharf with his relocation to the Company's headquarters in accordance with the Company's generally applicable relocation policy, as well as reimburse Mr. Scharf up to $10,000 per month for the cost of temporary housing and related expenses upon his commencement of employment with the Company through June 30, 2013, and for the cost of 12 first-class round-trip flights between the San Francisco Bay Area and New York for Mr. Scharf and/or his family during such period. Pursuant to the terms of Visa's generally applicable relocation policy and the Offer Letter, Mr. Scharf will be entitled to tax gross-up payments in connection with his taxable income related to the relocation and foregoing benefits.
Mr. Scharf will also be eligible to participate in the Visa Inc. Executive Severance Plan previously described by the Company in, and attached as Exhibit 10.1 to, the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 9, 2010, as well as eligible for coverage under the Company's liability insurance policy for directors and officers and form of indemnification agreement as in effect for other senior executives.
The Offer Letter is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
SAN FRANCISCO, October 24  Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced that the company's Board of Directors has elected Charles W. Scharf, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase), to succeed Joseph W. Saunders as Visa's Chief Executive Officer, effective November 1, 2012. Mr. Scharf is a former director of Visa Inc. (and its predecessor Visa U.S.A). Mr. Saunders, who has served as the company's CEO since 2007, will continue his duties as executive chairman of the company during the period of his employment, which extends to March 31, 2013. After Mr. Saunders retires, the Board intends to appoint a new non-executive independent chairperson. The Board has also expanded from 10 to 11 directors, and Mr. Scharf has been appointed a director, effective November 1, 2012.
Mr. Scharf is currently Managing Director at One Equity Partners, which manages $10 billion of investments and commitments for JPMorgan Chase. He previously spent nine years at JPMorgan Chase and its predecessors as the Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services, one of JPMorgan Chase's six lines of business, and a major issuer of Visa branded cards. The business generated revenue of $30 billion annually with 130,000 employees. He was previously Chief Financial Officer of Bank One from 2000 to 2002 and spent 13 years at Citigroup and its predecessor companies, serving as Chief Financial Officer for Citigroup's Global Corporate and Investment Bank prior to joining Bank One. He served on the Board of Visa U.S.A. from 2003 to 2007 and the Visa Inc. Board from 2007 to January 2011.
"It has been a pleasure and an honor to lead Visa through its transition to public listing," said Mr. Saunders. "Over the past five years, we have put the company on a clear path towards continued long-term growth. We have executed on our strategy to grow our core business, expand internationally and innovate to evolve our offerings to meet rapidly changing market conditions. This has allowed us to deliver value to our clients and investors."
Mr. Saunders continued, "I have known Charlie Scharf for almost a decade and I believe he is uniquely qualified to lead Visa in the future. He has a record of profitably growing businesses, and managing complex, large-scale global enterprises. He has demonstrated that he knows how to deliver value to customers and to shareholders. I am confident that under his leadership, Visa will continue to grow its core business globally and deliver innovation that meets customer needs. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless."
"The board has been working with Joe Saunders to ensure that we found a leader to succeed him who could build on his success and also address the opportunities Visa will face in the future," said John A. Swainson, lead independent director of the Visa Board. "On behalf of the entire Board, we thank Joe for his tireless work and leadership. The Visa that he will hand over to Charles Scharf is in every way stronger and well-positioned for long-term growth. Joe finalized the merger that created Visa Inc. and led the company through its successful public listing, which provided Visa with an opportunity to fulfill its potential  to invest in global growth."
Mr. Swainson continued, "Charlie is an experienced, versatile leader. While at Chase, he built one of the premier retail banking operations in the U.S, and at Citi he served as CFO of a complex global business that operated in more than 110 countries providing securities, transaction processing and banking

I am honored to be able to continue to lead the Visa team towards this end."

Exhibit 10.1
This Indemnity Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of , by and between Visa Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and [FULL NAME] ("Indemnitee").
                        
WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve as directors, officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance and adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.
WHEREAS, Article VIII of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the company (the "Certificate of Incorporation") provides for indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company. Officers and directors may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). The indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the board of directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification.
WHEREAS, increased difficulty in attracting and retaining highly competent persons to serve as directors and officers would be detrimental to the best interests of the Company's members.
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as a supplement to and in furtherance of Article VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified.
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified hereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
1.        Indemnitee will serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders Indemnitee's resignation or is no longer serving in such capacity. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined below) or any Enterprise (as defined below)) and Indemnitee. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that Indemnitee's employment with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or any Enterprise), if any, is at will, and the Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise

Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee's ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing a Proceeding to enforce this right of advancement. The Indemnitee shall qualify for Advances, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, solely upon the execution and delivery to the Company of an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of the Company, applicable law or otherwise. This Section 10(a) shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9 (a) or (b).
(b)        The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.
(c)        The Company shall not settle any action, claim or Proceeding (in whole or in part) that would impose any Expense, judgment, fine, penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent.
 
11.        
Procedure for Notification and Application for Indemnification.
(a)        Indemnitee shall notify promptly the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter that may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of any obligation that it may have to the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or otherwise.
(b)        Indemnitee may deliver to the Company a written application to indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee in accordance with this Agreement. Such application(s) may be delivered from time to time and at such time(s) as Indemnitee deems appropriate in Indemnitee's sole discretion. Following such a written application for indemnification by Indemnitee, the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be determined according to Section 12(a) of this Agreement.
12.        
Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.
(a)        A determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made in the specific case by one of the following methods: (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board or (ii) if so determined by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or Expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
(b)        In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 12(b). The Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. If the Independent Counsel is selected by the Board, the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel
 
so selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been received, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(b) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Delaware Court, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 12(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
provided
however
(c)        The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel and to fully indemnify and hold harmless such Independent Counsel against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
13.        
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.
(a)        In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(b) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
(b)        If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 12 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a final judicial determination that any or all such indemnification is expressly prohibited under applicable law; , , that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional fifteen (15) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto.
provided
however
(c)        The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(d)        For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 13(d) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
(e)        The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
14.        
Remedies of Indemnitee.
(a)        In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, is not timely made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, 6, 7 or the last sentence of
 
Section 12(a) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (v) a contribution payment is not made in a timely manner pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, or (vi) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by the Delaware Court to such indemnification, contribution or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee's option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Delaware law (without regard to its conflict of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
(b)        In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 shall be conducted in all respects as a trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, and the Company may not refer to or introduce into evidence any determination pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement adverse to Indemnitee for any purpose. If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section 14, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Section 10 until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).
de novo
(c)        If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
(d)        The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
(e)        The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law against all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after the Company's receipt of such written request) advance to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Expenses that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration brought by
 
Indemnitee (i) to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement or any other indemnification, advancement or contribution agreement or provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, or the Company's By-laws now or hereafter in effect; or (ii) for recovery or advances under any insurance policy maintained by any person for the benefit of Indemnitee, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance, contribution or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
(f)        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.
15.        
Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.
(a)        The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's By-laws, any agreement, a vote of members or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee's Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in applicable law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under Article VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
(b)        The DGCL and Article VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation permit the Company to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements ("Indemnification Arrangements") on behalf of Indemnitee against any liability asserted against Indemnitee or incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee or in such capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or arising out of Indemnitee's status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify Indemnitee against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement or under the DGCL, as it may then be in effect. The purchase, establishment, and maintenance of any such Indemnification Arrangement shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or of the Indemnitee under this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or the other party or parties thereto under any such Indemnification Arrangement.
 
(c)        To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, trustees, partners, managing members, fiduciaries, employees, or agents of the Company or of any other Enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time the Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding as to which Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness or otherwise), the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
(d)        In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
(e)        The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Enterprise.
16.        All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee serves as a director or officer of the Company or as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other Enterprise which Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company and shall continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Proceeding (including any rights of appeal thereto and any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement) by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, whether or not Indemnitee is acting in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under this Agreement.
Duration of Agreement.
17.        If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible,
Severability.
 
the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.
18.        
Enforcement and Binding Effect.
(a)        The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director or officer of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director or officer of the Company.
(b)        Without limiting any of the rights of Indemnitee under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company as they may be amended from time to time, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.
(c)        The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other Enterprise at the Company's request, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee's spouse, legally recognized domestic partner, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives.
(d)        The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
(e)        The Company and Indemnitee agree herein that a monetary remedy for breach of this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and difficult of proof, and further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee may enforce this Agreement by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance hereof, without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable harm and that by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which Indemnitee may be entitled. The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith. The
 
Company acknowledges that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required of Indemnitee by the Court, and the Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.
19.        No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
Modification and Waiver.

Visa Inc. Posts Strong Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2012 Adjusted Earnings Results and Announces New $1.5 billion Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2012. Adjusted quarterly and full-year net income per class A common share outstanding are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables. On an adjusted basis, the Company's financial results reflect the impact of special items that are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan.
Foster City, CA, October 31, 2012
GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.7 billion or diluted class A common stock earnings per share of $2.47. Adjusted net income in the fiscal fourth quarter was $1.0 billion or diluted class A common stock earnings per share of $1.54, excluding a special item related to the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves which increased net income by $627 million. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding in the fiscal fourth quarter was 672 million.
GAAP net income for the full-year 2012 was $2.1 billion, which included several special items: a one-time non-cash deferred tax adjustment of $208 million during the fiscal second quarter; a covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits during the fiscal third quarter; and the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves which totaled $627 million during the fiscal fourth quarter. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share was $3.16. On an adjusted basis, excluding the aforementioned special items, net income for the full-year 2012 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 19% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted class A common stock earnings per share was $6.20, an increase of 24% over the prior year. The weighted-average number of diluted class A common shares outstanding for the full year was 678 million.
 
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 15% over the prior year. Currency fluctuations contributed a negative 1 percentage point of growth towards quarterly net operating revenues.
GAAP net operating revenue for the full-year of 2012 was $10.4 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year and driven by double-digit revenue growth contributions from service, data processing and international transaction revenues. There was no significant impact on full-year results related to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year.
"Visa delivered strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year, a result of our focus on growing our core business, accelerating expansion of our business outside the U.S and investing in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments," said Joseph Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc.
"With our solid record of growth and sound strategy, Visa has a strong foundation for continued long-term growth as technology-enabled change continues to shape our global market. We will continue to invest in new technologies that will help our financial institution clients expand their businesses, add incremental value to the merchant community, and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our partners. We see extraordinary opportunity for growth in the payments industry."
Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2012, on which fiscal fourth quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 6% over the prior year at $978 billion.
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was a positive 6% over the prior year at $1 trillion.
Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was a positive 10% for the three months ended September 30, 2012.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended September 30, 2012, were 14 billion, a positive 2% increase over the prior year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter 2012, service revenues were $1.3 billion, an increase of 14% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 15% over the prior year to
 
$1.1 billion. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border volume, grew 5% over the prior year to $796 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $172 million, flat compared to the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $563 million and represent 17% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $1.2 billion for the quarter, an 18% increase over the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $10.5 billion at September 30, 2012.
Fiscal Full-Year 2012 Financial Highlights:
For the fiscal full-year 2012, service revenues were $4.9 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Data processing revenues rose 14% over the prior year to $4.0 billion. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border volume, grew 13% over the prior year to $3.0 billion. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $704 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $2.2 billion and represent 17% of gross revenues.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet for the 12 months ended September 30, 2012, totaled 53 billion, a 5% increase over the prior year.
Excluding the litigation provision recorded in the fiscal third quarter of 2012, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12% over the prior year to $4.2 billion.
Excluding special items, the Company's adjusted tax rate was 32.9% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012.
Notable Events:
Total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares during the three months ended September 30, 2012, which was funded from $324 million of our operating cash on hand. Of the $324 million, $174 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $150 million from our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. This deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock as it reduces the as-converted class B common stock share count.
 
As announced on October 24, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 4, 2012, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of November 16, 2012.
The Board of Directors has authorized a new $1.5 billion class A share repurchase program. The authorization will be in place through October 2013, and is subject to further change at the discretion of the Board.

Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were impacted by several special items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.

Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of several special items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules.
 
 
 
The tables below provide information regarding the available operational results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as well as the prior four quarterly reporting periods and the 12 months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Also included is a table with information on the number of billable transactions processed on Visa Inc.'s CyberSource network.
1. Branded Volume and Transactions
The tables present total volume, payments volume, and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue until terminated by either party on written notice to the other party, such termination to become effective ten (10) days from the date of the notice; provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by Company on such shorter notice as may be required for Company to comply with applicable law, regulations, the requirements of any financial institution with a security or other interest in the Aircraft, insurance requirements, or in the event the insurance required hereunder is not in full force and effect.

4. Annual Cap.
All payments to be made to Company by Executive hereunder shall be paid in the manner set forth in this Section. Company will pay, or cause to be paid, the expenses related to the operation of the Aircraft hereunder in the ordinary course.

Executive shall pay all amounts due under the invoice not later than fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

Company shall not be liable to Executive or any other person for loss, injury, or damage occasioned by the delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason.

(b) Approval of Flight Requests.
In the absence of another flight scheduled on the Aircraft by Executive or another scheduled business trip, the Aircraft may remain at the destination until its next required use. In the event the Aircraft must be repositioned, this Agreement shall be implemented such that all costs of deadhead flights (up to the amount described in Section 3) shall be borne by Executive if such flights are attributable to the personal use of the Aircraft and would be reportable in the Summary Compensation Table for Executive absent reimbursement.
(c) Repositioning of Aircraft.
7. Flight Operations.
Company shall be responsible for the physical and technical operation of the Aircraft and the safe performance of all flights under this Agreement, and shall retain full authority and control, including exclusive operational control and exclusive possession, command and control of the Aircraft for all flights under this Agreement.

Executive specifically agrees that the flight crew shall have final and complete authority to delay or cancel any flight for any reason or condition that in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command could compromise the safety of the flight, and to take any other action that in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command is necessitated by considerations of safety. No such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability to Executive or any other person for loss, injury, damage or delay. Company's operation of the Aircraft hereunder shall be strictly within the guidelines and policies established by Company and FAR Part 91.
(c) Authority of Pilot-in-Command.
Company shall, at its own expense, cause the Aircraft to be inspected, maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled, and tested in accordance with FAR Part 91 so that the Aircraft will remain in good operating condition and in a condition consistent with its airworthiness certification and shall take such requirements into account in scheduling the

In the event that any non-standard maintenance is required during the term and will interfere with Executive's requested or scheduled flights, Company, or Company's pilot-in-command, shall notify Executive of the maintenance required, the effect on the ability to comply with Executive's requested or scheduled flights and the manner in which the parties will proceed with the performance of such maintenance and conduct of such flight(s).

The applicable Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender a written confirmation (signed by an Authorized Officer) of each telephonic notice, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or such Lender.

If any payment of principal of or interest on a Loan shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made by the applicable Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
2.21     .   Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each applicable Lender of the contents of each Total Commitment reduction notice, Revolving Advance Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and repayment or prepayment notice received by it hereunder.

2.22     .   Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with Article XIV, or the Administrative Agent, may by written notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made available by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.
Lending Installations
2.23     .

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Compensation Rate and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the Base Rate. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Revolving Advance. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent
(b)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the
 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Compensation Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or such Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this  shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
clause (b)
2.24     .   (a)  Each Multi-Currency Revolving Lender agrees that it shall at all times have a participation in, and acknowledges that it is irrevocably and unconditionally obligated, upon receipt of notice that the Administrative Agent has received a Swing Funding Notice for any Euro Swing Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, to fund (or to cause an Affiliate to fund) its participation in, such outstanding Euro Swing Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan in an amount equal to its Multi-Currency Pro Rata Share (or such greater share as may be determined pursuant to Section 2.29(a)(iv)) of the amount of such Euro Swing Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan. Each Revolving Lender agrees that it shall at all times have a participation in, and acknowledges that it is irrevocably and unconditionally, upon receipt of notice that the Administrative Agent has received a Swing Funding Notice for any U.S. Swing Loan, required to fund (or to cause an Affiliate to fund) its participation in, such outstanding U.S. Swing Loan in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (or such greater share as may be determined pursuant to Section 2.29(a)(iv)) of the amount of such U.S. Swing Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate Total Outstandings held by any Lender (whether directly or by participation) shall not exceed such Lender's Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be.
Participations in Swing Loans
(b)     The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Revolving Lender of its receipt of a Swing Funding Notice. Promptly (and in any event within one Business Day in the case of U.S. Swing Loans and three Business Days in the case of Foreign Currency Swing Loans or Euro Swing Loans) after receipt of such Notice, each applicable Revolving Lender shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Swing Lender an amount in the applicable Agreed Currency and in Same Day Funds equal to its applicable share of all outstanding Swing Loans of such Swing Lender (it being understood that no Revolving Lender which is an Affiliate of a Swing Lender shall be obligated to make any amount available to such Swing Lender unless otherwise required by such Swing Lender). If any Revolving Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Lender the full amount of such Revolving Lender's participations in all Swing Loans of such Swing Lender by the date which is one Business Day (or, in the case of Foreign Currency Swing Loans or Euro Swing Loans, three Business Days) after its receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, then interest shall accrue on such Revolving Lender's obligations to fund such participations, from such date to the date such Revolving Lender pays such obligations in full, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to each relevant Loan as in effect from time to time during such period.
 
(c)     From and after the date on which the Administrative Agent has received a Swing Funding Notice for any Swing Loan, all funds received by a Swing Lender in payment of any Swing Loan made by such Swing Lender, interest accrued thereon after the first (or, in the case of a Foreign Currency Swing Loan or Euro Swing Loan, third) Business Day following delivery of such notice and other amounts payable in respect thereof shall be delivered by such Swing Lender to the Administrative Agent, in the same funds as those received by such Swing Lender, to be distributed to all applicable Revolving Lenders in accordance with their applicable shares (i.e., giving effect to the funding of participations pursuant to this Section 2.24), except that the applicable share of such funds of any applicable Revolving Lender that has not funded its participations as provided herein shall be retained by such Swing Lender.
(d)     If the Administrative Agent or any Swing Lender is required at any time to return to any Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator or custodian or any official in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, any portion of any payment made by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Swing Lender in respect of any Swing Loan or any interest thereon, each applicable Revolving Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Lender its applicable share of the amount so returned by the Administrative Agent or such Swing Lender plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the rate specified by such Swing Lender as its cost of funds for such period.
(e)     The Required Lenders, the Swing Lenders and the Administrative Agent may agree on any other reasonable method (such as making assignments of Swing Loans) for sharing the risks of Swing Loans ratably among all applicable Revolving Lenders as provided herein so long as such method does not materially disadvantage any Lender.
(f)     Each applicable Revolving Lender's obligation to purchase participation interests in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 2.24 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against any other Lender, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect, (c) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower or any other Lender, (d) any inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this Agreement on the date upon which any participation interest in any Swing Loan is to be purchased or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(g)     Notwithstanding the provisions of above, no Revolving Lender shall be required to purchase a participation interest in any Swing Loan if, prior to the making of such Swing Loan, the applicable Swing Lender received written notice from the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders specifying that one or more of the conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan were not satisfied and, in fact, such conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan were not satisfied at the time of the making of such Swing Loan; provided that the obligation of such Revolving Lender to purchase such participation interest shall be reinstated on the date on which all conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan have been satisfied (or waived by the Required Lenders or all Revolving Lenders, as applicable).

Intentionally Omitted
2.26     .   If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, nonappealable judgment is given. The obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, such Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 12.2, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.

Increase in Commitments
(a)     Provided there exists no Default or Event of Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify such of the Revolving Lenders as the Borrowers may specify), the Borrowers may, from time to time, elect to increase the Total Commitment to an amount (after giving effect to all such increases) that does not exceed U.S.$5,000,000,000; that (i) each increase shall be in a minimum amount of U.S.$25,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers may make a maximum of five such elections. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrowers (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each applicable Revolving Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the applicable Revolving Lenders).
provided
(b)     Each applicable Revolving Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, the amount of such increase and whether such increase is of its Dollar Revolving Commitment or Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment. Any Revolving Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment.
 
(c)     The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and each applicable Revolving Lender of the applicable Revolving Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Borrowers may also invite Eligible Assignees to become Lenders.
(d)     If the Total Commitment is increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving Lenders) of the final allocation of such increase and such Increase Effective Date. On or before such Increase Effective Date, each Eligible Assignee that becomes a new Revolving Lender shall execute a joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent is authorized and directed to amend and distribute to the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving Lenders) a revised Schedule 1 that gives effect to each increase in the Total Commitment and the allocation thereof among the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving Lenders).
(e)     If on the Increase Effective Date, there is an unpaid principal amount of Revolving Loans, the applicable Borrowers shall, on such date or on such date or dates thereafter as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify (in consultation with Visa Inc. and having regard to the avoidance of amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.5, in each case so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), borrow Revolving Loans from the Revolving Lenders and/or prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on each Increase Effective Date for the sole purpose of insuring that the Revolving Loans (including, without limitation, the Types thereof and Interest Periods with respect thereto) shall be held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata according to their revised applicable shares.

(c)     in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.4 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.1, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;

(a)      . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
Adjustments
  (i)     . Such Defaulting Lender's right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" and Section 8.3.
Waivers and Amendments
  (ii)     . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 12.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Swing Lenders hereunder; third, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan or participation therein in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender's potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans or participations therein under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Lender or any Swing Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Swing Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

sixth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and seventh, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders as provided herein prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Swing Loans are held by the Lenders as required herein without giving effect to Section 2.29(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
provided
  (iii)     .   No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee payable under Section 2.11 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
Commitment Fees
  (iv)     .   All or any part of such Defaulting Lender's unfunded participation obligations in Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the applicable Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied at the time the applicable Swing Loan was made (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions were satisfied at such time) and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Total Outstandings held by any Non-Defaulting Lender (whether directly or by participation) to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender's Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be. No reallocation hereunder shall be deemed to increase the Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be, of any Non-Defaulting Lender or decrease the Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be, of any Defaulting Lender or constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation.
Reallocation of Unfunded Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure
  (v)     .   If the reallocation described in above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall, within two Business Days following written notice and request by the Administrative Agent and without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, prepay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Lenders' Fronting Exposure.
Repayment of Swing Loans
clause (a)(iv)
 
(b) . If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Swing Lenders agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Swing Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the applicable Lenders (without giving effect to Section 2.29(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and , , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to applicable Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each applicable Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof after demand therefor in accordance with Section 3.7(a), for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) below.

Evidence of Payments
(e)     .

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A) set forth in Section 3.1(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below or (B) required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation
(ii)     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)     any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W 9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)     any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
 
reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(I)     in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
(II)       executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(III)     in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a "U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate") and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(IV)     to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2 or Exhibit I-3, IRS Form W-9 and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)     any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)     if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii)     Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.1 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f)     .   Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines in good faith that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.1, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 3.1 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
(g)     .   Each party's obligations under this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
Survival
 
3.2     .   If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Installation to make, maintain or fund Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to any Currency Reference Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or another Agreed Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any Currency Reference Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any other Agreed Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, the interest rate on the Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate), on the earlier of the last day of the Interest Period or the Maturity Date, as applicable, therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Illegality
3.3     .   If the Required Lenders or an applicable Swing Lender, as the case may be, determines (which determination shall be made in good faith) that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or an applicable Swing Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, as applicable, that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or another Agreed Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period or day, as applicable, of such Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining any applicable Currency Reference Rate for any requested Interest Period or day, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan, (whether denominated in Dollars or another Agreed Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (c) the applicable Currency Reference Rate for any requested Interest Period or day, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans or applicable Swing Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, the utilization of the Daily Floating One Month Rate in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders or an applicable Swing
Inability to Determine Rates
 
Lender) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans or applicable Swing Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.4     .
Increased Costs
(a)     . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
  (i)     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except (A) any reserve requirement reflected in a Currency Reference Rate and (B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost Rate, other than as set forth below); or
  (ii)     subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in  through  of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
clauses (b)
(d)
  (iii)     result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost Rate, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Loans; or
  (iv)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to any Currency Reference Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender and in accordance with Section 3.7, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)     . If any Lender determines in good faith that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Swing Loans held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of
Capital and Liquidity Requirements
 
such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time upon request by such Lender and in accordance with Section 3.7, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
3.5     .
Compensation for Losses
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time in accordance with Section 3.7(a), the applicable Borrower shall promptly (and in accordance with Section 3.7) compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any actual loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a)     any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan by such Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan or a Swing Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise);
(b)     any failure by such Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a Swing Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower;
(c)     any failure by such Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Agreed Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or
(d)     any assignment of a Eurocurrency Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.28;
excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any actual foreign exchange losses and any actual loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The applicable Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Loan was, when funded by such Lender, funded at such rate.
3.6     .
Mitigation of Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a)     . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.4, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.2, then at the request of the Borrowers such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
Designation of a Different Lending Installation
 
Lending Installation for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.4, as the case may be, in the future or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.2, as applicable and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)     . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.4, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Installation in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 2.28.
Replacement of Lenders
3.7     .
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
(a)     . If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any indemnified amounts, additional amounts, or compensation pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(i), 3.4 or 3.5, it shall promptly deliver a certificate (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to the Borrowers or applicable Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the indemnified amount or amounts, the additional amount or amounts, or the compensation to be paid to it hereunder and the basis and calculation thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Borrowers or applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof.

Each Plan is and has been in all material respects operated and administered in accordance with its provisions and applicable law.

Subject to Section 13.2.2, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.3 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.1(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.3; that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.6 and 2.28 as if it were an assignee under Section 13.3 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1 or 3.4 or 3.5, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation or unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Visa Inc.'s prior written consent. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers' request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.6 with respect to any Participant.

    13.2.2 .   A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.6 as though it were a Lender.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Upon request, the applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 13.3.1 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance
provided
 
with Section 13.2. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed to amend Schedule 1 from time to time to reflect any assignment or transfer pursuant to this Section 13.3.1 or Section 2.28, and the addition of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.27 and to deliver such amended Schedule 1 to the Borrowers and each Lender.

In the event of any such resignation as a Swing Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Swing Lender hereunder (subject to the
Resignation as Swing Lender after Total Assignment
 
consent of such proposed successor Swing Lender); , however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the retiring Swing Lender as a Swing Lender. If any Swing Lender resigns as a Swing Lender, it shall retain all the rights of a Swing Lender provided for hereunder with respect to its Swing Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.24. Upon the appointment of a successor Swing Lender, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Lender.
provided

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Visa Inc. Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2013 Net Income of $1.3 billion or $1.93 per diluted share and Authorizes New $1.75 Billion Share Repurchase Program
 
 
 
 
 
 Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal first quarter 2013 ended December 31, 2012. Net income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year, or $1.93 per share, an increase of 30% over the prior year. These results included a catch-up tax benefit effect resulting from new guidance on apportionment rules from the State of California, are consistent with our full-year tax and earnings per share guidance, and represent about 11 cents of earnings per share for the quarter. All references to earnings per share assume fully diluted class A share count unless otherwise noted.
Foster City, CA, February 6, 2013
Net operating revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $2.8 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year, driven by strong growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. There was no significant impact on current quarter results related to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year.
"Visa again delivered a strong quarter of revenue and earnings driven by success across our global franchise," said Charlie Scharf, Chief Executive Officer. "Our results include significant continued investments in our core business, accelerating international expansion and the deployment of next-generation payment solutions for the benefit of our financial institution and merchant partners." Added Scharf, "We have been committed to using our capital wisely and that includes returning capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. The board's decision to increase Visa's repurchase authorization continues that commitment, supported by confidence we have in our future."
Fiscal First Quarter 2013 Financial Highlights:
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2012, on which fiscal first quarter service revenue is recognized, was 6% over the prior year at $1.0 trillion.
 
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2012, was 9% over the prior year at $1.1 trillion.
Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was 11% for the three months ended December 31, 2012.
Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended December 31, 2012, were 14.2 billion, a 4% increase over the prior year.
Fiscal first quarter 2013 service revenues were $1.3 billion, an increase of 13% versus the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 17% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border activity, grew 8% over the prior year to $805 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $179 million, a 1% increase over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $553 million and represent 16% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses were $1.0 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year, primarily due to higher personnel and professional fees associated with investments in technology projects to support our growth initiatives.
The effective tax rate was 28.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. This rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit recognized during the quarter as a result of new guidance issued by the State of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012.
Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.1 billion at December 31, 2012.
The weighted-average number of diluted class A common stock outstanding was 669 million.
Notable Events:
Under the terms of the class settlement agreement in the Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL) 1720, in December 2012, the Company paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. Additionally, in October 2012, the Company made a payment of $350 million to the individual plaintiffs' settlement fund.
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 9 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $145.40 per share, using $1.3 billion of cash on hand.
The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new $1.75 billion class A share repurchase program. The authorization will be in place through January 2014, and is subject to further change at the discretion of the Board.
As announced on January 30, 2013 the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) payable on March 5, 2013, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C common stock as of February 15, 2013.
On January 30, 2013, the Company held its 2013 annual meeting of stockholders during which holders of the Company's class A common stock at the close of business on December 4, 2012 voted on the four proposals enumerated in the Company's proxy statement. All of management's proposals were approved, but the single stockholder proposal failed to pass.

Footnote
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

San Francisco, California 94128
Attention: Charlie Scharf, CEO
Dear Charlie:
As previously agreed and announced by Visa Inc. (the "Company') on December 12, 2012, my resignation from the position of President of the Company is effective as of March 31, 2013 (the "Resignation Date"). Rather than terminating my employment with the Company, however, this letter confirms that I will remain on as an employee of the Company on an "at will" basis following the Resignation Date to provide assistance on special projects, provided I receive, subject to applicable withholdings: (1) a reduced monthly salary of $50,000 after the Resignation Date, (2) a payment of $562,500 in November 2013 (representing a pro-rated target VIP bonus for employment as President through March 31, 2013), and (3) employee benefits as are generally available to the Company's U.S. employees. Services associated with my continued employment will be in an amount sufficient to ensure that I have not, and will not be deemed to have, incurred a "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at any time until my employment with the Company terminates in its entirety.
I understand that during the time of my employment I will continue to vest in any equity incentive awards previously granted to me, pursuant to the terms of such awards. I also understand and agree that following the Resignation Date, the Company will not grant to me, and I shall have no right or entitlement to receive, any new grant of equity incentive awards or cash incentive awards or bonuses (other than the $562,500 referenced above). In exchange for my continued employment with the Company, I agree that in the event that my employment with the Company terminates for any reason after November 30, 2013, I will execute (and will not revoke) a separation agreement containing a full release of claims, confidentiality, non-solicitation and other customary terms, in a form provided by the Company. In the meantime, by signing below, I release and waive all claims arising out of the terms of my employment after the Resignation Date, as described in this letter, including claims that such terms could give rise to a Covered Termination or a termination for Good Reason under the Visa Inc. Executive Severance Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement between me and the Company. I understand the arrangement described in this letter contains consideration by both me and the Company and is legally binding.

On a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter decreased 2% and diluted earnings per share increased 1% over the prior year. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count unless otherwise noted. The Company's adjusted quarterly net income per share of class A common stock is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 15% over the prior year, driven by strong growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. There was no significant impact on current quarter results related to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year.
"Visa's strong financial and operational performance reflects continued momentum across our core business during the fiscal second quarter," said Charlie Scharf, Chief Executive Officer. "To drive future transaction growth, we continue to invest in new technologies, channels and capabilities to make Visa transactions more valuable, accessible and secure. Looking ahead, we will continue to evolve our business practices to better support clients of all sizes."

International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border activity, grew 13% over the prior year to $831 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $175 million, a 2% decrease over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $567 million and represent 16% of gross revenues.
Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year, primarily due to personnel, marketing and network and processing fees associated with investments in technology projects to support our global growth initiatives.
The effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investment securities were $5.6 billion at March 31, 2013.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results
US$ in millions, except percentages and per share data
Our reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2012 benefited from a one-time non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities ("deferred tax adjustment"), which was recorded in our income tax provision during that period. We believe the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2012, excluding the $208 million benefit, provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in that period. The following table presents our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2013, as compared to our adjusted financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2012.
 
 
 
 
The tables below provide information regarding the available operational results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, as well as the prior four quarterly reporting periods and the 12 months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Also included is a table with information on the number of billable transactions processed on Visa Inc.'s CyberSource network.
1. Branded Volume and Transactions
The tables present total volume, payments volume, and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands.

The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for volume-based data.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's members on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information.
Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ("Nominal USD"). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information ("Constant USD"). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.
