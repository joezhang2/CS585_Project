TI SEES IMPROVEMENT IN FOURTH-QUARTER EXPECTATIONS DALLAS (Dec. 2, 2002) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) said today that the company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 2002 to be better than previously estimated. TI's Semiconductor revenue is now expected to decline about 2 percent sequentially, instead of the 5 percent originally noted in the company's earnings report on October 21. Total TI revenue is now expected to be down about 7 percent instead of 10 percent, mostly reflecting the seasonal drop in calculator shipments. Earnings per share also should be better than expected, at about $0.03 pro forma and $0.01 GAAP, plus or minus a few cents. "The improvement in fourth-quarter expectations comes primarily from stronger demand for our wireless and high-performance analog products,"said Chief Financial Officer Bill Aylesworth. Aylesworth will discuss TI's outlook and business strategies to address key markets for its Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Analog technologies at the Credit Suisse First Boston Annual Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Tuesday, December 3.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
.
Note:
All results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 
DALLAS (April 15, 2003)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today reported that first-quarter revenue increased 2 percent sequentially and 20 percent compared with the year-ago period due to growth in Semiconductor. Higher Semiconductor factory utilization and lower depreciation expense contributed to an increase in earnings.
 
Semiconductor revenue grew 2 percent sequentially due to higher shipments of digital signal processors (DSP) and Digital Light Processing
TM
(DLP
TM
) products Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor revenue increased 23 percent due to growth in DSP, Analog and DLP productsDSP revenue grew 6 percent sequentially and 31 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue declined 4 percent sequentially and grew 15 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Revenue from the wireless market was about even with the fourth quarter and increased 39 percent from the year-ago quarter.
.
.
 
Sensors & Controls revenue increased 5 percent sequentially and 11 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) revenue declined 2 percent sequentially and 10 percent compared with the year-ago period.
 
 
Gross profit of $862 million increased 12 percent sequentially and 41 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin expanded to 39.3 percent of revenue, an increase of 3.5 percentage points sequentially and 5.9 percentage points compared with the year-ago quarter. Higher Semiconductor factory utilization levels and lower depreciation expense were responsible for the higher gross profit and margin.
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $408 million was about even sequentially and increased 5 percent compared with the year-ago quarter due to increased product development activity in Semiconductor, especially for wireless products.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $301 million increased 4 percent sequentially and 13 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses.
 
Operating profit of $153 million, or 7.0 percent of revenue, increased $86 million sequentially and $197 million compared with the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to gains in Semiconductor.
 
Other income (expense) net (OI&E) of $14 million includes interest income, investment gains (losses) and other items. OI&E in the first quarter increased sequentially and compared with the year-ago quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $638 million non-cash write-down of its Micron Technology, Inc. common stock, which TI received in connection with the sale of its memory business unit to Micron in 1998. The write-down reduced fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) by $0.37. Interest expense of $13 million decreased on a sequential basis and compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net income in the quarter was $117 million, or $0.07 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24 percent. In line with the company's outlook issued in the fourth-quarter earnings announcement, the first quarter's results include $28 million of amortization of acquisition-
 
related costs and a $10 million charge associated with the redemption of $250 million in convertible notes. These notes were issued in February of 2000 by Burr-Brown Corporation, which was acquired by TI in August of 2000.
 
Orders of $2295 million in the first quarter increased 10 percent sequentially and 20 percent from the year-ago period. Semiconductor orders of $1914 million increased 9 percent sequentially and 24 percent from the year-ago period. Semiconductor book-to-bill rose to 1.03 compared with 0.96 in the previous quarter.
 
"TI's semiconductor position strengthened in the first quarter as we introduced the world's fastest DSP, the world's first fully functional wireless digital baseband made with 90-nanometer process technology and the world's first concept design for integrating three different wireless technologies - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 2.5G - in personal digital devices," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO. "TI's momentum was reflected in market share gains for 2002 in both DSP and Analog. We have noted before that revenue growth in our Semiconductor business would fall through to profit margins at a high rate, and we saw that in the first quarter. Semiconductor gross margin rose to 40 percent, and operating margin gained more than 300 basis points."
 
 
Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) of $4145 million was about even with the end of the prior quarter and increased by $696 million from the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations decreased to $196 million compared with $744 million in the prior quarter and $296 million in the year-ago quarter due to a tax refund in the year-ago quarter as well as an increase in the first quarter of 2003 in accounts receivable and inventory levels. Capital expenditures were $132 million in the first quarter, down from $236 million in the fourth quarter and up from $120 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts receivable of $1365 million increased sequentially by $148 million due to stronger end-of-quarter shipments in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable increased from $1159 million in the year-ago quarter due to the higher revenue level. Days sales outstanding were 56 days at the end of the first quarter compared with 51 days in the prior quarter and 57 days in the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory increased to $882 million, up $92 million sequentially and up $114 million compared with the year-ago quarter primarily because Semiconductor increased work-in-process inventory levels to support anticipated higher shipments in the second quarter. Days of inventory increased to 60 days at the end of the first quarter from 52 days at the end of the prior quarter and 57 days in the year-ago quarter
.
 
Regarding the current market environment, Engibous said: "Semiconductor markets have improved significantly from the lows of 2001, but with the uncertainties of world economies we remain prudent in our planning, continuing to preserve both the technological and financial competitiveness of our various businesses with sustained levels of R&D investments and tight controls on costs. Throughout all of our business and support functions, we are working to make sure our costs are better than or on par with industry benchmarks. This will sometimes require difficult decisions that affect jobs."
 
Outlook
 
For the second quarter of 2003, TI expects sequential revenue growth of about 7 percent. Inside that total, Semiconductor is expected to contribute about 4 percent sequential growth; Sensors & Controls is expected to be about even with first quarter; and E&PS is expected to seasonally increase about 100 percent.
 
 
TI expects operating profit margin in the second quarter to be about 7 percent and EPS to be about $0.08, plus or minus a few cents. This includes the restructuring charge and amortization expense described below.
 
TI will incur a restructuring charge of about $40 million in the second quarter that impacts EPS by about $0.02. This charge is primarily for the first phase of restructuring actions that ultimately will affect about 800 jobs through voluntary retirement and involuntary termination programs over the next two years primarily at the Attleboro, Mass., headquarters of the Sensors & Controls business. Sensors & Controls is moving certain production lines from Attleboro to other TI sites in order to be geographically closer to customers and their markets and to reduce manufacturing costs. This action is part of continuing work to preserve the strength and competitiveness of Sensors & Controls, which will maintain its worldwide headquarters in Attleboro and will, over time, add engineering and business development jobs at this site. To a lesser degree, the charge also includes the first phase of restructuring actions that ultimately will affect about 450 jobs in Semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S. and international locations, as those operations continue to become more productive with fewer people. The reduction of jobs in Sensors & Controls will occur through the end of 2004, and the reduction of jobs in Semiconductor will occur through the middle of 2004. Over this period of time, the company expects additional charges associated with these actions to total about $60 million and will distribute them over the quarters in which the jobs are eliminated. When complete, these restructuring actions are expected to result in about $80 million of annualized savings, of which $45 million will be in Semiconductor and $35 million will be in Sensors & Controls.
 
Amortization of acquisition-related costs is expected to be about $26 million in the second quarter.
 
 
For 2003, TI continues to expect: R&D to be about $1.7 billion capital expenditures to be about $800 million; and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to be about 24 percent, unchanged from the company's previous estimate.

* Net income for the first quarter of 2003 includes, in millions of dollars, a charge of $10 in other income (expense) net from the redemption of $250 million in convertible notes. Net income (loss) for the first quarter of 2002 includes, in millions of dollars, a charge of $17, of which $14 is for restructuring charges primarily related to the closing of the Semiconductor manufacturing facility in Merrimack, New Hampshire. Of the $14, $9 is for the acceleration of depreciation over the remaining service life of the facility, and $4 is for fixed asset write-downs for assets held for sale. Of the $17 charge, $16 is included in cost of revenue and $1 is in other income (expense) net. Net income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2002 includes, in millions of dollars, a write-down due to an other-than-temporary reduction in value of $638 below basis in the company's holdings in Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) common stock acquired in connection with the sale of its memory business unit to Micron in 1998, and a charge of $17 for severance costs, of which $13 is associated with the reduction of 434 jobs, primarily in the manufacturing area, to align resources with market demand. Of the $17 charge, $11 is included in cost of revenue, $4 is in selling, general and administrative expense and $2 is in research and development expense.
 
Net income (loss) includes, in millions of dollars, acquisition-related amortization of $28 for all quarters presented.
 
 
** Diluted earnings (loss) per common share are based on average common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding (1753.4 million shares, 1734.4 million shares and 1731.6 million shares for the first quarter of 2003 and first and fourth quarters of 2002). For the first and fourth quarters of 2002, dilutive potential common shares outstanding have been excluded due to the net loss for the period.

Exhibit 99 ---------- TI REVISES 2Q03 OUTLOOK - - TI'S SEQUENTIAL REVENUE GROWTH IS NOW EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 5% - - CHANGE IS DUE TO WIRELESS SEMICONDUCTOR SALES THAT ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED BECAUSE OF WEAKER DEMAND IN ASIAN MARKETS Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time Conference call number (973) 582-2741 (no passcode required) Live audiocast at http://www.ti.com/ir Dallas (June 10, 2003) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) today said that its sequential revenue growth in the second quarter will be at the lower end of its previous expectations due to reduced sales of semiconductors to wireless customers. Wireless customers are experiencing a slowdown in demand for handsets and excess inventory, particularly in Asia. Demand for TI's semiconductor products in other markets continues to be robust. As a result, TI now expects total sequential revenue growth of about 5 percent, instead of its original forecast of about 7 percent. Inside the total, TI's semiconductor segment now expects sequential growth of about 2 percent instead of about 4 percent. The company's other business segments, Sensors & Controls and Educational & Productivity Solutions, remain on track to meet original expectations. TI expects wireless semiconductor revenue to decline about 10 percent sequentially in the second quarter and other semiconductor revenue to increase by more than 5 percent. Compared with the second quarter of 2002, wireless revenue should increase by more than 10 percent and other semiconductor revenue should increase by more than 5 percent. Earnings per share are now expected to be about $0.06, plus or minus a few cents, instead of about $0.08, plus or minus a few cents. The expected reduction in earnings is due about equally to lower revenue and higher charges associated with restructuring in certain of the company's manufacturing facilities. The company recently expanded its previously-announced restructuring actions to include the reduction of about 250 jobs in Semiconductor manufacturing operations in Japan. Total restructuring charges for the quarter are now expected to be about $55 million instead of $40 million, primarily due to higher than expected severance costs in the current quarter and the addition of the action in Japan. "As we noted in our April conference call, some inventory of wireless semiconductors was built in Asian markets, particularly China, toward the end of the first quarter. That inventory, which would have been successfully worked through under normal conditions, instead stalled as demand has weakened in those markets. We believe the weakness in demand is largely due to the ongoing economic impact associated with SARS, and should abate as the health concerns are resolved," said Tom Engibous, TI Chairman, President and CEO. # # # ABOUT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS Texas Instruments Incorporated provides innovative DSP and analog technologies to meet our customers' real world signal processing requirements.

Note: All results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
DALLAS (July 21, 2003)Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today reported that second-quarter revenue of $2339 million increased 7 percent sequentially due to seasonal growth in Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) as well as growth in Semiconductor. Revenue grew 8 percent compared with the year-ago quarter due to growth in Semiconductor.
 
Semiconductor revenue increased 3 percent sequentially as growth from a broad range of semiconductor products offset a sequential decline in wireless. Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor revenue increased 9 percent due to growth in demand across most product lines.
 
Revenue from the wireless market was down 5 percent sequentially and was up 16 percent from the year-ago quarter. Despite the sequential decline, wireless revenue was higher than the company expected in its June 10 financial update due to strong customer demand during
 
the last few days of the quarter. Broadband revenue grew 44 percent on a sequential basis and 84 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue grew 5 percent sequentially and 4 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. DSP revenue was about even sequentially and grew 21 percent compared with the year-ago quarter.
 
Sensors & Controls revenue increased 3 percent sequentially and 4 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. In a seasonally strong quarter, E&PS revenue increased 104 percent sequentially and 4 percent compared with the year-ago period.
 
In the second quarter, the company incurred $49 million in restructuring charges. Of that total, $43 million is included in cost of revenue, and $6 million is in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. TI expects an additional $100 million in restructuring charges by the end of 2004. These charges are related to job reductions and will be distributed over the quarters in which jobs are eliminated. When completed, the restructuring actions are expected to result in about $105 million of annual savings, of which $65 million will be in Semiconductor and $40 million will be in Sensors & Controls.
 
Gross profit of $877 million increased 2 percent sequentially and 3 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin was 37.5 percent of revenue, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points sequentially and 2.1 percentage points compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to restructuring charges.
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $424 million was up 4 percent sequentially and 5 percent compared with the year-ago quarter due to increased product development activity within Semiconductor, especially for wireless products.
 
SG&A expense of $328 million increased 9 percent sequentially and 10 percent compared with the year-ago period primarily due to higher G&A expenses, including lease termination and restructuring expenses. Seasonally higher E&PS marketing expenses also contributed to the sequential growth in SG&A.
 
Operating profit of $125 million, or 5.3 percent of revenue, decreased $28 million sequentially and $30 million compared with the year-ago quarter due to restructuring charges.
 
Other income (expense) net (OI&E) of $36 million includes interest income, investment gains (losses) and other items. OI&E increased sequentially and compared with the year-ago quarter due to lower net investment losses as well as a $10 million charge in the first quarter associated with the redemption of convertible notes originally issued by Burr-Brown Corporation, which was acquired by TI. Interest expense of $10 million declined on a sequential basis and compared with the year-ago quarter due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net income in the quarter was $121 million, or $0.07 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20 percent, lower than previously expected due to a revision in the company's expected tax rate for the year and the resulting cumulative catch-up tax benefit of $3 million.
 
TI orders of $2311 million and Semiconductor orders of $1901 million in the second quarter were about even sequentially and compared with the year-ago period. The Semiconductor book-to-bill ratio was 0.99 for the second quarter, compared with 1.03 in the prior quarter.
 
"TI's revenue growth in the second quarter demonstrates the benefit of diversity in our products and markets as sequential growth across almost all of our major product lines more than offset a decline in wireless. We believe TI continues to gain share in critical markets, including broadband communications, digital signal processing and analog," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO.
 
"Important product milestones were reached during the quarter, including demonstration of the world's first 1-gigahertz DSP and the first product made using our new high-performance analog manufacturing process that provides best-in-class performance and integration benefits for precision data converters and amplifiers," Engibous said. "We also announced our entry into the CDMA wireless market with standard chipsets that we'll be sampling this quarter. Toward the end of the quarter, we announced selection of the site for our next 300-millimeter wafer fab, further establishing TI's position as one of the world's very few semiconductor companies with the manufacturing technology and financial strength to compete successfully over the long term."
 
Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) of $4183 million increased by $38 million compared with the end of the prior
 
quarter and increased by $709 million from the end of the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations increased to $378 million compared with $196 million in the prior quarter due to working capital, and decreased slightly compared with $387 million in the year-ago quarter. Capital expenditures were $162 million in the second quarter, up from $132 million in the first quarter and down from $177 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts receivable increased sequentially by $75 million due to seasonally higher sales of E&PS products. Accounts receivable were about even with the year-ago quarter. Days sales outstanding were 55 days at the end of the second quarter compared with 56 days in the prior quarter and 60 days in the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory increased by $118 million sequentially primarily to support reduced product lead times. In addition, delays by certain wireless customers of product shipments from second quarter into third quarter and a normal seasonal increase in E&PS contributed to higher inventory. Compared with the year-ago quarter, inventory increased $180 million primarily due to the higher revenue level and to support reduced product leadtimes. Days of inventory increased to 62 days at the end of the second quarter compared with 60 days at the end of the prior quarter and 56 days at the end of the year-ago quarter
.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on September 9 by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the third quarter of 2003, TI expects total revenue to be in the range of $2290 million to $2490 million. Inside that total, Semiconductor revenue is expected to be in the range of $1890 million to $2050 million; Sensors & Controls revenue is expected to be in the range of $230 million to $250 million; and E&PS revenue is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million.
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.23, including a $0.13 per share contribution from the company's previously announced sale of 24.7 million shares of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock. Restructuring charges in the third quarter are expected to be about $45 million.
 
For 2003, TI continues to expect: R&D to be about $1.7 billion capital expenditures to be about $800 million; and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 22 percent, exclusive of the tax impact of the Micron stock transaction, compared with the company's previous estimate of 24 percent.

News Release
C-03054
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: All results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
DALLAS (October 20, 2003)Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today reported financial results that reflect strengthened conditions across its semiconductor markets in the third quarter. TI's total revenue of $2533 million increased 8 percent sequentially and 13 percent from the year-ago quarter due to growth in Semiconductor. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.25 in the quarter, including a contribution from the sale of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock and the impact of charges for restructuring and an acquisition.
 
Semiconductor segment revenue increased 10 percent sequentially due to higher shipments of DSP products into the wireless and digital consumer electronics markets, as well as higher shipments of high-performance analog products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor revenue increased 16 percent due to higher shipments of DSP, high-performance analog and Digital Light Processing (DLP) products.
TI revenue from the Semiconductor wireless market increased 22 percent sequentially and 30 percent from the year-ago quarter due to growth in 2.5G wireless modems and OMAP applications processors. Broadband revenue increased 11 percent sequentially primarily due to strong demand for the company's latest multimode wireless local area networking (LAN) products that support the IEEE 802.11 a, b and g standards. Broadband revenue increased 74 percent from the year-ago quarter due to strength in wireless LAN and DSL. Revenue from Analog products increased 7 percent sequentially and 6 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to demand for high-performance analog products. DSP revenue increased 22 percent sequentially and 37 percent from the year-ago quarter.
 
In the Sensors & Controls segment, revenue decreased 7 percent sequentially and increased 2 percent from the year-ago quarter. In the Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) segment, revenue increased 13 percent sequentially and decreased 2 percent from the year-ago quarter.
 
In the third quarter, the company incurred $56 million in charges related to previously announced restructuring actions, of which $48 million is included in cost of revenue, $7 million in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense and $1 million in research and development (R&D) expense. The company also incurred a non-tax-deductible $23 million in-process R&D charge related to the company's acquisition of Radia Communications, Inc. in the quarter.
Gross profit of $1030 million increased 18 percent sequentially and 23 percent from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin was 40.7 percent of revenue, up 3.2 percentage points sequentially and 3.6 percentage points from the year-ago quarter as higher revenue fell through to gross profit at a high rate due to increased utilization of the company's largely fixed-cost manufacturing assets in its Semiconductor operations.
 
R&D expense of $468 million was up 10 percent sequentially and 13 percent from the year-ago quarter due to the inclusion of purchased in-process R&D from the Radia acquisition, as well as increased product development activity within Semiconductor, especially for wireless products.
 
SG&A expense of $313 million decreased 5 percent sequentially primarily due to a lease termination expense in the second quarter. SG&A expense was about even with the year-ago period.
 
Operating profit of $249 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue, increased $124 million sequentially and $140 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit.
Other income (expense) net (OI&E) of $143 million includes interest income, investment gains (losses) and other items. OI&E increased $107 million sequentially and $86 million from the year-ago quarter due to a pre-tax gain of $106 million from the company's previously announced sale of 24.7 million shares of Micron stock. Interest expense of $8 million declined $2 million sequentially and $6 million from the year-ago quarter due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net income in the quarter was $447 million, or $0.25 per share. The Micron transaction includes the recognition of a previously reserved tax benefit of $162 million associated with TI's impairment write-down of Micron stock in the fourth quarter of 2002. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26 percent exclusive of the tax impact resulting from the recognition of the previously reserved tax benefit associated with the Micron stock transaction. The effective tax rate was higher than previously expected due to a revision in the company's expected tax rate for the year and the resulting cumulative catch-up tax expense of $6 million. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be 24 percent.
 
TI orders of $2662 million increased 15 percent sequentially and 26 percent from the year-ago period. Semiconductor orders of $2295 million increased 21 percent sequentially and 29 percent from the year-ago period. The Semiconductor book-to-bill ratio was 1.08 for the third quarter, up from 0.99 in the prior quarter.
"TI's revenue and profit margins continue to rebound," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO. "As the semiconductor market has rebuilt momentum, TI has grown faster as a result of the manufacturing technology and product R&D investments we maintained through the industry's downturn.
 
"These investments have resulted in volume production of a wide range of 130-nanometer products with 90-nanometer products already sampling and scheduled to be in production soon. TI has shipped more than 100 million chips to our customers in 130-nanometer," Engibous said. "When these advanced technologies are combined with 300-millimeter wafers, it means TI can design and manufacture products that perform better, consume less power and cost less than products from competitors that have not made or been able to make these investments.
 
"One example of the success of this strategy is the development of OMAP applications processors for smartphones and PDAs. These processors generated about half of our wireless revenue growth in the third quarter compared with a year ago," Engibous said. "We see similar enthusiasm for TI's new products for the broadband and digital consumer electronics markets, as well as for our new high-performance analog products. We expect that the revenue growth from these and other new products, as well as the benefits of ongoing cost management and lower depreciation levels, will be drivers for further profit expansion."
Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) of $4538 million increased by $355 million from the end of the prior quarter and by $894 million from the end of the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations increased to $510 million from $378 million in the prior quarter due to higher net income, and decreased from $565 million in the year-ago quarter. Capital expenditures were $233 million in the third quarter, up from $162 million in the previous quarter and down from $269 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts receivable increased by $82 million sequentially and $94 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding declined to 54 days at the end of the third quarter from 55 days in the prior quarter and 57 days in the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory decreased by $5 million sequentially primarily due to higher seasonal shipments of E&PS products in the quarter. Compared with the year-ago quarter, inventory increased $172 million in anticipation of higher Semiconductor product shipments in the fourth quarter of 2003 and to support reduced product lead times. Days of inventory were 60 days at the end of the third quarter compared with 62 days at the end of the prior quarter and 52 days at the end of the year-ago quarter
.
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on December 8 by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2003, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.19. Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter are expected to be about $15 million.
 
For 2003, TI expects: R&D to be about $1.75 billion, higher than the previous estimate due to the Radia acquisition capital expenditures to be about $800 million, unchanged from the previous estimate; and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion, unchanged from the previous estimate. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 24 percent, exclusive of the tax impact resulting from the recognition of the previously reserved $162 million tax benefit associated with the Micron stock transaction during the third quarter.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (Jan. 26, 2004)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported that fourth quarter 2003 revenue of $2770 million increased 9 percent sequentially and 29 percent from the year-ago period due to robust growth across almost all of the company's Semiconductor product lines.
 
For the year, TI revenue was $9834 million, up 17 percent from 2002 due to growth in Semiconductor that was led by demand for Digital Signal Processors (DSP) across the wireless, digital consumer and broadband markets.
 
Earnings per share were $0.29 in the quarter, including a $0.07 contribution from the sale of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock and a $0.02 contribution from a reduction in TI's estimated taxes for 2003.
 
Semiconductor revenue in the fourth quarter increased 16 percent sequentially and 34 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to strong demand for a broad range of DSP and
Analog products. For the year, Semiconductor revenue increased 20 percent from 2002, primarily due to strong demand for DSP products. From an end-equipment perspective, higher shipments into the wireless market provided the most significant source of growth as wireless revenue increased 23 percent sequentially, 41 percent from the year-ago quarter and 32 percent for the year.
 
"The fourth quarter marked the second consecutive period of double-digit sequential revenue growth in Semiconductor. The new revenue record for our sales into the wireless market, and the excellent growth in both DSP and high-performance Analog are particularly noteworthy. When compared to competitors, I believe TI's performance for the quarter and for the year will show that this growth is due to both a broad recovery in the market and to gains in market share," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO.
 
"For the year, TI's operating activities generated more than $2 billion in cash flow. We started the year with a very healthy balance sheet, and it grew significantly stronger as TI and the market gained momentum through the course of the year. This strong financial position has allowed us to remain focused on our strategic objectives.
 
"Moving forward, I am pleased by the progress in our high-performance Analog competitiveness, where our position is strengthening both technologically and with customers. Additionally, the fundamentals of wireless continue to be attractive as expanding handset functionality based on TI technology increases our semiconductor content in each handset. Looking ahead, our R&D investments in OMAP
TM
application processors, in complete chipset solutions and in new standard products for the CDMA market should provide new opportunities for our wireless technologies," Engibous said.
 
"In wireless and other targeted markets such as broadband communications and digital consumer, we have combined our systems skills with our DSP and Analog technologies and leading manufacturing capabilities to deliver product solutions that generate unprecedented levels of TI content in our customers' equipment. We will continue to offer our customers more complete solutions, and as we do, I believe our financial results will reflect the increased value we bring to their systems.
 
"Because we have maintained high levels of R&D investment, we are well-positioned to advance in existing markets and enter new markets early. This is particularly important as the strength of the overall market for semiconductors improves. Manufacturing capacity and demand are more in balance today than at any time in the last three years, resulting in an encouraging outlook for revenue and profits in the year ahead," he said.
 
Details of Financial Results
 
Revenue
 
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue of $2770 million increased by $237 million sequentially and increased by $624 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
For the year, TI revenue of $9834 million increased $1451 million from 2002.
 
Charges
 
In the fourth quarter, the company incurred $13 million in charges related to previously announced restructuring actions, of which $11 million is included in cost of revenue and $2 million is included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.
 
For the year, the company incurred $118 million in restructuring charges, of which $102 million is included in cost of revenue, $14 million in SG&A expense and $2 million in research and development (R&D) expense. When completed at the end of 2004, the restructuring actions are expected to result in about $105 million of annual savings, of which $65 million will be in Semiconductor and $40 million will be in Sensors & Controls.
 
For the year, the company also incurred a non-tax-deductible $23 million in-process R&D charge in the third quarter related to the company's acquisition of Radia Communications, Inc., and a $10 million charge in other income (expense) net (OI&E) in the first quarter related to the redemption of $250 million in convertible notes issued by Burr-Brown Corporation, which TI acquired in 2000.
 
Gross Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, gross profit of $1194 million increased 16 percent sequentially and 55 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin was 43.1 percent of revenue, up 2.4 percentage points sequentially primarily due to lower restructuring charges, and up 7.3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter due to greater utilization of the company's fixed-cost manufacturing assets in its Semiconductor operations.
 
For the year, gross profit of $3962 million, or 40.3 percent of revenue, increased 29 percent from 2002 due to the impact of higher revenue, which was partially offset by increased restructuring charges of $77 million.
 
Expenses
 
R&D expense of $448 million decreased by $20 million, or 4 percent, sequentially due to the Radia in-process R&D charge incurred in the third quarter. Compared with the year-ago period, R&D expense increased 9 percent due to increased product development in Semiconductor, primarily for wireless. For the year, R&D expense of $1748 million increased 8 percent from 2002 due to increased product development in Semiconductor, primarily for wireless.
 
SG&A expense of $308 million declined 2 percent sequentially due to lower restructuring charges. Compared with the year-ago quarter, SG&A expense increased 6 percent primarily due to higher Semiconductor marketing expenses. For the year, SG&A expense increased 7 percent from 2002 primarily due to higher Semiconductor marketing expenses.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $438 million, or 15.8 percent of revenue, increased by $189 million, or 76 percent, sequentially and increased by $371 million, or 557 percent, from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit.
 
For the year, operating profit of $965 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue, increased 235 percent from 2002 due to higher gross profit.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net and Interest Expense
 
OI&E of $131 million decreased $12 million sequentially primarily due to lower gains on the company's fourth-quarter sales of Micron common stock, which TI received in connection with the sale of its memory business unit to Micron in 1998.
 
Compared with the year-ago period, OI&E increased by $751 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $638 million impairment write-down of its holdings of Micron common stock. As previously announced, TI sold a portion of its Micron stock in the third quarter of 2003 for a pre-tax gain of $106 million, and TI sold its remaining shares in the fourth quarter of 2003 for a pre-tax gain of $97 million.
 
For the year, OI&E of $324 million increased by $901 million from 2002.
 
Interest expense of $8 million was about even sequentially. Interest expense decreased by $6 million compared with the year-ago quarter and by $18 million from 2002 due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net Income
 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $512 million, or $0.29 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20 percent. This rate is exclusive of the tax impact resulting from the recognition of the previously reserved tax benefit of $62 million associated with TI's impairment write-down of Micron stock in the fourth quarter of 2002. During the quarter, the company realized a $37 million tax reduction due to changes in the company's estimate of its foreign tax liabilities, which resulted in an effective tax rate that was lower than the company's previous estimate of 26 percent.
 
For the year, net income of $1198 million, or $0.68 cents per share, increased by $1542 million from 2002. Within the increase, $993 million was due to the impact of the Micron stock-related actions, and $440 million was due to higher operating profit. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 22 percent.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3076 million increased 16 percent sequentially and 47 percent from the year-ago quarter due to strength in Semiconductor orders. Semiconductor orders of $2744 million increased 20 percent sequentially and 56 percent from the year-ago period due to broad-based demand for Analog and DSP products. The Semiconductor book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter rose to 1.12.
 
For the year, TI orders of $10344 million increased 23 percent from 2002, and Semiconductor orders of $8854 million increased 27 percent, reflecting broad-based demand for DSP and Analog products.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) of $5664 million was up $1126 million from the end of the third quarter and up $1522 million from the end of 2002.
 
Cash flow from operations increased to $1067 million, up $557 million sequentially and $323 million from the year-ago period. For the year, cash flow from operations increased to $2151 million, up $159 million from 2002.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $272 million increased by $39 million sequentially and $36 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, capital expenditures of $800 million decreased by $2 million from 2002. TI's capital expenditures in 2003 were primarily for the deployment of advanced Semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.
 
In the fourth quarter, depreciation of $370 million increased by $14 million sequentially and decreased $27 million from the year-ago period. For the year, depreciation was $1429 million, down $145 million from 2002.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable of $1451 million decreased $71 million sequentially due to seasonally lower Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) graphing calculator revenue, and increased by $234 million from the end of 2002 due to higher Semiconductor revenue. Days sales outstanding were 47 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 54 at the end of the prior quarter and 51 at the end of 2002.
 
Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter decreased $11 million sequentially, to $984 million, due to the seasonal decline in E&PS inventory. Inventory increased by $194 million compared with the end of 2002 to support higher Semiconductor shipment levels. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 56, down from 60 days at the end of the prior quarter and up from 52 days at the end of 2002.
 
Debt
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the debt-to-total capital ratio was 0.07, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter and down from 0.10 at the end of 2002 due to reductions in debt.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on March 8 by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the first quarter of 2004, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.22.
 
For 2004, TI expects: R&D to be about $2.0 billion, capital expenditures to be about $1.1 billion and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion.
 
The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 30 percent.
 
TI expects that 2004 earnings will reflect revenue growth and higher operating margins. This performance is expected to exceed the company's the minimum threshold for the TI employee profit-sharing program. As a result, the company expects to make an accrual for profit sharing in the first quarter of 2004 and in each subsequent quarter. Profit-sharing expenses are accrued quarterly based on the company's estimate of its full-year financial performance. No accrual for profit sharing was made under this program in any quarter during 2003 and 2002.

products, and higher royalties. Revenue from microcontrollers was about even sequentially and increased compared with the year-ago quarter. For the year, remaining Semiconductor revenue increased 14 percent from 2002 due to higher demand for DLP, RISC microprocessors and standard logic products, and higher royalties, which more than offset a decline in microcontrollers.

Exhibit 99
 
News Release
C-04018
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (April 14, 2004)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported first-quarter 2004 revenue of $2936 million, an increase of 6 percent sequentially and 34 percent from the year-ago quarter due to strength in TI's Semiconductor business. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.21.
 
Semiconductor revenue increased 5 percent sequentially due to strong demand across a broad range of products, especially Digital Light Processing (DLP
) and high-performance analog. Growth in these areas more than offset a decline in revenue from wireless applications. TI's wireless revenue was the second highest on record despite the combination of normal handset seasonality and lower demand from TI's largest customer.
 
Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor revenue increased 38 percent due to demand across a broad range of products, particularly digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog used in wireless, as well as high-performance analog used in a variety of applications. Wireless revenue increased 35 percent from the year-ago quarter driven by demand for TI's most advanced products. High-performance analog revenue increased 58 percent from the year-ago quarter.
 
"The growth in Semiconductor revenue demonstrates the diversity in our customer base and our product portfolio," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO. "Shipments increased across most product lines and end markets. Notably, high-performance analog and DLP are both becoming major contributors to TI's growth and bottom line. Revenue from DLP products reached a record level as TI's technology continued to penetrate the business projector and high-definition television markets with an increasing array of customer brands and retail presence. Growth in high-performance analog reflected the significant investments we've made to establish a world-class development team and the quality of products this team has delivered.
 
"TI's strong wireless growth from the year-ago period continued to outpace the industry's handset shipments, which we believe reflects the company's increasing content per phone. A big factor in this growth was TI's family of OMAP
application processors, used to enable real multimedia capabilities in smartphones and 3G handsets," Engibous said.
 
"In all, the strength in customer orders and the continuing momentum of TI products lead us to believe that 2004 will be another strong year for our Semiconductor business. For the first time since 2000, we accrued for TI employee profit sharing, reflecting the company's expectations for strong growth and improving profitability," he said. "We are increasing R&D and also are adding capacity for additional assembly and test capabilities and an additional 90-nanometer manufacturing line. These actions will help ensure we can provide customers what they need, when they need it."
 
Details of Financial Results
 
Revenue
 
In the first quarter, TI revenue of $2936 million increased by $166 million sequentially and by $744 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit of $1322 million increased 11 percent sequentially and 53 percent from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin was 45.0 percent of revenue, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and up 5.7 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit and gross profit margin benefited from higher revenue and the resulting increased utilization of TI's fixed-cost Semiconductor manufacturing assets. This more than offset the accrual for profit sharing and the annual compensation expense increases that were incurred in the first quarter.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and Development (R&D) expense of $494 million increased 10 percent sequentially primarily due to an accrual for profit sharing and annual compensation expense increases that were incurred in the first quarter. R&D expense increased 21 percent compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher Semiconductor product development, particularly for wireless, combined with the profit sharing accrual and the annual compensation expense increases.
 
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expense of $354 million increased 15 percent sequentially and 18 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the accrual for profit sharing and the annual compensation expense increases.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $474 million, or 16.2 percent of revenue, increased by $36 million sequentially and increased by $321 million compared with the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit, which more than offset increased R&D and SG&A expenses.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E) and Interest Expense
 
OI&E of $50 million decreased by $81 million from the prior quarter, which included $97 million of pre-tax gain associated with the company's sale of its remaining shares of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock. Compared with the year-ago quarter, OI&E increased $36 million reflecting TI's investment write-downs and the charges associated with the retirement of Burr-Brown debt, both of which occurred in the year-ago quarter.
 
Interest expense of $8 million was even sequentially and declined by $5 million from the year-ago quarter due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $367 million, or $0.21 per share, down $145 million sequentially due to the prior quarter's gain from the sale of Micron stock and the company's recognition of a previously reserved tax benefit associated with an impairment write-down of TI's Micron stock in the fourth quarter of 2002, and due to an increase in the company's effective tax rate. Compared with the year-ago quarter, net income increased $250 million due to higher operating profit. Net income in the first quarter reflects a higher effective tax rate of 29 percent compared with the earlier periods.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3231 million increased 5 percent sequentially due to growth in Semiconductor, Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) and Sensors & Controls. Compared with the year-ago quarter, orders increased 41 percent primarily due to strength in Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders were $2810 million, up 2 percent sequentially. Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor orders were up 47 percent due to broad-based demand for the company's products. The Semiconductor book-to-bill ratio in the first quarter was 1.09.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the first quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $5493 million.
 
Cash flow from operations was $393 million, down $674 million sequentially primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventory. Compared with the year-ago quarter, cash flow was up $197 million due to higher net income.
 
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $401 million increased by $129 million sequentially and $269 million from the year-ago quarter. TI's capital expenditures in the first quarter primarily were used to increase assembly and test capacity, as well as for Semiconductor equipment to establish an additional 90-nanometer production line.
 
Depreciation of $348 million decreased by $22 million sequentially and was about even with the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable of $1678 million increased $227 million sequentially due to a higher revenue level in the final month of the first quarter compared with the final month of the prior quarter. Accounts receivable increased by $313 million from the end of the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 51 at the end of the first quarter, compared with 47 at the end of the prior quarter and 56 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory of $1148 million at the end of the first quarter increased $164 million sequentially and $266 million from the year-ago quarter to support anticipated higher shipments. Days of inventory at the end of the first quarter were 64, up from 56 days at the end of the prior quarter and up from 60 days at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Debt
 
At the end of the first quarter, TI's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 0.06, down from 0.07 at the end of the prior quarter, and down from 0.09 at the end of the year-ago quarter primarily due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on June 7 by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the second quarter of 2004, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.26.
 
For 2004, TI expects: R&D to be about $2.1 billion, up from the prior estimate of $2.0 billion; capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion, up from the prior estimate of $1.1 billion; and depreciation to be about $1.5 billion, up from the prior estimate of $1.4 billion.
 
The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 29 percent, compared with the company's prior expectation of about 30 percent.
 
 
 
Income includes, in millions of dollars, acquisition-related amortization of $19, $20 and $28 for the first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2003.

Exhibit 99 ---------- DELAWARE COURT INDICATES TI DID NOT MATERIALLY BREACH CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT, QUALCOMM NOT ENTITLED TO TERMINATE TI'S RIGHTS TI RETAINS RIGHTS TO QUALCOMM PATENTS DALLAS (July 1, 2004) -- Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today said that the Delaware Court of Chancery has expressed its intent to grant TI's motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit between TI and Qualcomm Incorporated. The court indicated it agreed with TI's argument that its disclosure of information regarding terms of a patent cross-license agreement was not a material breach, and that Qualcomm is not entitled to terminate TI's rights to Qualcomm's CDMA patents under the agreement. "Qualcomm's efforts to strip us of our rights under this cross-license agreement have failed. This is a victory for TI," said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Joseph F. Hubach. "We are grateful for the expeditious manner in which the court has dealt with this case." The court is expected to consider Qualcomm's claims for damages based on a non-material breach at a trial scheduled to begin August 16. Qualcomm filed suit against TI July 25, 2003, alleging a material breach of the confidentiality of the agreement. TI filed suit September 23, 2003, alleging that Qualcomm violated the cross-license agreement by granting royalty discounts to handset makers that use Qualcomm's semiconductor products. The court indicated today that it intends to grant Qualcomm's motion that it did not breach the agreement on this issue. The court is expected to issue a written opinion confirming these indications. ### "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Exhibit 99
 
News Release
C-04037
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (July 20, 2004)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported second-quarter 2004 revenue of $3241 million, an increase of 10 percent sequentially and 39 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to strength in TI's Semiconductor business. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.25.
 
Semiconductor revenue increased 8 percent sequentially and 44 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to strong demand for digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog products used in a broad range of electronic equipment. Record revenue was achieved in several Semiconductor operations, including wireless, which grew 15 percent sequentially; high-performance analog, which grew 13 percent sequentially; and Digital Light Processing
TM
(DLP), which grew 10 percent sequentially.
 
"Revenue growth was excellent," said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. "We believe our Semiconductor business has gained market share in both the first and second quarters of 2004, building on TI's annual market share gains achieved in 2002 and 2003.
This reflects the strength we've built in our advanced technology and the relationships we're developing with customers.
 
"In particular, this was an important quarter for our wireless operations, with growth across a broad base of customers and a broad mix of our products," Templeton said. "Digital baseband modems for W-CDMA 3G cell phones have emerged as a significant growth contributor, accounting for about one-fourth of sequential wireless revenue growth in the second quarter. In addition, the latest research from market analyst IDC shows that our OMAP
TM
processors garnered two-thirds of the rapidly growing market for wireless application processors in 2003. The company's strength in modems and application processors has given us the early lead in the W-CDMA cell phone market. Underscoring the importance of this technology combination, TI and 3G service leader NTT DoCoMo announced plans to integrate next-generation OMAP 2 application processors with digital baseband modems to support the UMTS standard, which is based on W-CDMA and is expected to be the prevalent worldwide standard for 3G wireless phones," Templeton said.
 
"2004 is on course to be a very strong year. TI's Semiconductor revenue in the second quarter was higher than it has ever been, and the company's operating profit is approaching an all-time record. With stable depreciation and a lower expected profit-sharing accrual next year, TI is well positioned to continue to deliver higher levels of profitability as revenue expands," Templeton said.
 
Details of Financial Results
 
Revenue
 
In the second quarter, TI revenue of $3241 million increased $305 million sequentially and $902 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit of $1481 million increased 12 percent sequentially and 69 percent from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin was 45.7 percent of revenue, up 0.7 percentage points sequentially and 8.2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit and gross profit margin benefited primarily from higher revenue.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense was $514 million, or 15.8 percent of revenue, compared with $494 million, or 16.8 percent of revenue in the prior quarter. R&D expense was $424 million, or 18.1 percent of revenue, in the year-ago quarter. The higher R&D expense is a result of increased product development activity in Semiconductor, especially for wireless products, as well as a higher profit-sharing accrual.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $375 million, or 11.6 percent of revenue, compared with $354 million, or 12.0 percent of revenue, in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a higher profit-sharing accrual as well as seasonally higher marketing expense in the company's Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) business. In the year-ago quarter, SG&A expense was $328 million, or 14.0 percent of revenue, with the increase primarily due to the profit-sharing accrual.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $592 million, or 18.3 percent of revenue, increased $118 million sequentially and $467 million compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher gross profit that more than offset higher operating expenses.
 
Second-quarter results include a higher profit-sharing accrual, which contains a cumulative catch-up, compared with the first quarter, reflecting an upward adjustment in the company's expectations for its 2004 performance. There was no profit-sharing accrual in the year-ago quarter. Profit sharing is allocated across cost of revenue, SG&A and R&D. Profit sharing is expected to decline in 2005 compared with 2004 and will reflect a new TI employee profit-sharing plan.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E) and Interest Expense
 
OI&E of $38 million decreased $12 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
 
Interest expense of $8 million was even sequentially and declined $2 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $441 million, or $0.25 per share, an increase of $74 million sequentially and $320 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher operating profit.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3253 million increased 1 percent sequentially. Compared with the year-ago quarter, orders increased 41 percent due to strength in Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders were $2762 million, down 2 percent sequentially. Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor orders increased 45 percent due to broad-based demand for the company's products.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the second quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $5534 million.
 
Cash flow from operations was $506 million, up $113 million sequentially and $128 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
 
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $356 million decreased $45 million sequentially and increased $194 million from the year-ago quarter. TI's capital expenditures in the second quarter were used primarily to increase capacity for assembly and test operations, and for 90-nanometer wafer fabrication.
 
Depreciation of $363 million increased $15 million sequentially and $7 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable of $1930 million increased $252 million sequentially due to higher revenue and seasonally higher E&PS receivables. Accounts receivable increased $490 million from the end of the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 54 at the end of the second quarter, compared with 51 at the end of the prior quarter and 55 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory of $1285 million at the end of the second quarter increased $137 million sequentially and $285 million from the year-ago quarter as the company continued to build inventory to targeted levels, especially in standard products, to support customer plans for the
 
second half of the year and to ensure the company's ability to respond to upside potential. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter were 66, compared with 64 days at the end of the prior quarter and 62 days at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Debt
 
At the end of the second quarter, TI's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 0.06, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter. In the third quarter, TI's $400 million 7 percent notes will mature and will be paid using available cash.

Exhibit 99 ---------- NEWS RELEASE C-04041 TI UPDATES THIRD-QUARTER 2004 BUSINESS OUTLOOK - - Revenue Expected between $3100 Million and $3240 Million - - EPS Expected between $0.27 and $0.29 CONFERENCE CALL ON TI WEB SITE AT 3:30 P.M. CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME TODAY WWW.TI.COM ---------- DALLAS (Sept. 8, 2004) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the third quarter of 2004, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) today revised its expected revenue and earnings ranges. This update reflects what TI believes are adjustments by customers as they move quickly to reduce inventory levels to more closely match their own end-equipment growth rates. These adjustments are more aggressive in standard products sold through the distribution channel than in other areas. The company's expectations for revenue are: - - Total revenue between $3100 million and $3240 million, compared with the prior range of $3200 million to $3440 million; - - Semiconductor revenue between $2665 million and $2785 million, compared with the prior range of $2780 million to $2980 million; - - Sensors & Controls revenue between $260 million and $270 million, compared with the prior range of $255 million to $275 million; and - - Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $175 million and $185 million, compared with the prior range of $170 million to $190 million. TI expects earnings per share (EPS) between $0.27 and $0.29, compared with the previous range of $0.26 to $0.29. The company's revised earnings estimate reflects reduced factory loadings and a lower expected accrual for profit sharing. Additionally, the effective annual tax rate has been reduced from 29 percent to 26 percent, primarily due to an increase in the estimated tax benefit for export sales. Including catch-up adjustments, the third-quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be about 21 percent. The company will hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. CDT today to discuss this update. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI's original third-quarter outlook was published in the company's second-quarter 2004 earnings release on July 20, available at www.ti.com. TI's third quarter ends on September 30. # # # "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This success enables us to increase the return we deliver our shareholders with a large stock buyback and a higher dividend," said Rich Templeton, TI's president and chief executive officer. TI plans to repurchase shares at times and prices considered appropriate by the company. The share repurchase program announced today is in addition to the company's existing plan to repurchase 21 million shares authorized in February 2004. TI expects the first quarterly distribution of the new dividend will be payable November 22, 2004, to stockholders of record on November 1, 2004, contingent upon formal declaration by the Board of Directors at its regular meeting in October.

Exhibit 99
News Release
C-04047
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (Oct. 18, 2004)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported third-quarter 2004 revenue of $3250 million, about even with the second quarter and up 28 percent from the year-ago quarter. Revenue from the company's wireless and Digital Light Processing
TM
(DLP
TM
) semiconductor products reached record levels for the second consecutive quarter. Strong sequential growth in these areas offset declines in other areas, primarily in standard products, which were affected by ongoing inventory adjustments, especially in distribution channels.
 
Compared with the third quarter of last year, the increase in TI's revenue reflected double-digit growth across all the company's major Semiconductor operations, with particularly strong contributions from wireless, DLP and high-performance analog products.
 
In the segments of TI's business, Semiconductor revenue was even sequentially and up 31 percent from a year ago. Sensors & Controls revenue seasonally declined 5 percent from the prior quarter, and increased 14 percent from the year-ago period due to broad-based demand. Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) revenue increased 13 percent sequentially primarily due to seasonal back-to-school demand, and 8 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to strong retail demand for new graphing calculators.
Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.32 include benefits from taxes, which the company discussed in its mid-quarter update on Sept. 8, 2004. Earnings were better than anticipated in the mid-quarter update primarily because the company had higher non-operating income, operating expenses were further reduced, and revenue strengthened late in the quarter.
 
"TI's operating profit in the third quarter more than doubled from a year ago to reach an all-time high," said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. "The value of TI's diverse product portfolio was evident as weaker revenue from standard products was offset by record revenue from both wireless and DLP products. In wireless, TI has achieved early leadership in the UMTS market, which is widely expected to be the prevalent global standard for 3G. A strong majority of these 3G cell phones are based on TI digital signal processors. Likewise, in the nascent market for digital televisions, our DLP technology is now outselling plasma in the North American market for big-screen TVs.
 
"Nonetheless, the environment is not without challenges. In the third quarter, distributors and customers adjusted semiconductor inventories, and these adjustments have continued into the fourth quarter. In response, we have taken quick actions to sharply reduce production loadings, which should enable us to exit the year with lower inventory levels. We also tightened expense controls across the board," he said.
"In this more uncertain environment, it is important to note that TI's operational flexibility has resulted in a more stable financial model for the company. Our manufacturing strategy combines internal and foundry capacity so that TI's most capital-intensive, advanced-logic factories remain highly utilized as the market expands and contracts. This strategy proved successful in the third quarter as utilization in TI's advanced-logic factories remained high. In addition, this strategy has allowed us to reduce capital spending. TI's capital expenditures in each year since 2001 have been lower as a percent of revenue than any in the past decade," he said.
 
"I am very confident in TI's position and future. Cash flow is high, our long-term prospects are excellent, and our balance sheet is strong. To increase the return we deliver shareholders, in the quarter we announced plans for a $1 billion share repurchase and a 17 percent higher dividend," Templeton said.
 
Details of Financial Results
 
Revenue
 
In the third quarter, TI revenue of $3250 million increased $9 million sequentially and $717 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit of $1489 million, or 45.8 percent of revenue, was about even sequentially. A reduction in the profit-sharing accrual was offset by the higher expense that resulted from lower utilization of Semiconductor's manufacturing assets, particularly for production of analog products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, gross profit increased by $459 million, or 45 percent, as a result of higher revenue.
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $483 million, or 14.9 percent of revenue, declined $31 million compared with the prior quarter primarily due to the lower profit-sharing accrual, as well as additional expense reductions. R&D expense increased from $468 million in the year-ago quarter due to higher product development expenses in Semiconductor, especially for wireless products.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $349 million, or 10.7 percent of revenue, down $26 million compared with the prior quarter due to the lower profit-sharing accrual. SG&A expense increased from $313 million in the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher marketing expenses, particularly in Semiconductor.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $657 million, or 20.2 percent of revenue, increased $65 million sequentially due to lower operating expenses. Compared with the year-ago quarter, operating profit increased $408 million due to higher gross profit.
 
As discussed in the Sept. 8, 2004, update to the company's outlook, third-quarter results include a lower profit-sharing accrual compared with the second quarter, reflecting a downward adjustment in the company's expectations for its 2004 performance. The adjustment resulted in a cumulative reduction in the profit-sharing accrual in the third quarter. There was no profit-sharing accrual in the year-ago quarter. Profit sharing is allocated across cost of revenue, SG&A and R&D.
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E) and Interest Expense
 
OI&E of $62 million increased $24 million from the prior quarter due to the partial settlement of matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding TI's former memory business operations. Compared with the year-ago quarter, OI&E decreased $81 million due to a pre-tax gain of $106 million recorded in the third-quarter of 2003 related to the company's sale of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock.
 
Interest expense of $4 million declined $4 million from the second and year-ago quarters due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $563 million, or $0.32 per share, an increase of $122 million sequentially due to higher operating profit, as well as lower taxes. Compared with the year-ago quarter, net income increased $116 million primarily due to higher operating profit, which more than offset lower OI&E and higher taxes. The year-ago quarter included the recognition of a previously reserved tax benefit of $162 million associated with TI's impairment write-down of Micron stock in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
As discussed in the Sept. 8, 2004, update to the company's outlook, the expected annual tax rate was revised to 26 percent as of the end of the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in the estimated U.S. tax benefit for export sales. Net income in the quarter reflects an effective quarterly tax rate of 21 percent due to the cumulative reduction in tax expense.
Orders
 
TI orders of $3019 million decreased 7 percent sequentially primarily due to lower demand for Semiconductor products, as well as a seasonal decline in E&PS demand. Compared with the year-ago quarter, TI orders increased 13 percent due to higher demand for Semiconductor products. Semiconductor orders were $2623 million, down 5 percent sequentially primarily due to lower demand for standard products sold through distribution channels, which more than offset higher demand for wireless and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, Semiconductor orders increased 14 percent due to higher demand across a broad range of products.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the third quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $5617 million. In the third quarter, as previously announced, TI redeemed $400 million of 7 percent notes that matured during the quarter.
 
Cash flow from operations was $942 million, up $436 million sequentially and $432 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $330 million decreased $26 million sequentially and increased $97 million from the year-ago quarter. TI's capital expenditures in the third quarter were used primarily to increase capacity for assembly and test operations, and for 90-nanometer wafer fabrication.
 
Depreciation of $378 million increased $15 million sequentially and $22 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable of $1965 million increased $35 million sequentially due to higher shipments in the last month of the third quarter compared with the last month of the second quarter. Accounts receivable increased $443 million from the end of the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 54 at the end of the third quarter, the same as the end of the prior and year-ago quarters.
 
Inventory of $1356 million at the end of the third quarter increased $71 million sequentially primarily due to wireless products being manufactured to support expected seasonally higher shipments early in the fourth quarter. In addition, inventory growth reflects factory loadings that were made in anticipation of higher third-quarter demand that failed in part to materialize, partially offset by sharp reductions in loadings that were made later in the quarter. Compared with the year-ago quarter, inventory increased $361 million as the company built inventory to support higher shipments, as well as to support the company's targets for lead times and on-time deliveries. Days of inventory at the end of the third quarter were 69, compared with 66 days at the end of the prior quarter and 60 days at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Debt
 
At the end of the third quarter, TI's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 0.03, down from 0.06 at the end of the prior quarter.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on Dec. 7, 2004, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2004, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.28.
 
For 2004, TI expects: R&D to be about $2.0 billion compared with the prior estimate of $2.1 billion; capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion, unchanged from the previous estimate; and depreciation to be about $1.5 billion, unchanged from the previous estimate.
 
For 2004, the effective tax rate is expected to be about 25 percent, which reflects the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit that was signed into law on Oct. 4, 2004. The effect of the reinstated credit is not included in the company's third-quarter results because GAAP requires that companies use the law in effect at the end of the quarter when determining tax rates. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, TI expects an effective quarterly tax rate of about 21 percent, which represents the cumulative reduction in tax expense resulting from the change in the company's effective annual tax rate.
 
 
Income includes, in millions of dollars, acquisition-related amortization of $16, $19 and $26 for the third quarter and second quarter of 2004 and the third quarter of 2003.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (Jan. 25, 2005)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported that revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $3153 million. Revenue decreased 3 percent sequentially due to the seasonal decline in graphing calculators sold into the educational market, and increased 14 percent from the year-ago period due to growth in Semiconductor, the company's largest segment. For the year, TI revenue was $12,580 million, up 28 percent due to 31 percent growth in Semiconductor.
 
Revenue in the company's Semiconductor segment was about even sequentially as strong growth in products for the wireless market and higher royalty revenue were offset by declines in other areas, primarily standard products reflecting continued inventory adjustments by distributors. Semiconductor revenue increased 14 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to strong growth in products sold into the wireless market and increased sales of the company's proprietary Digital Light Processing (DLP) products, which are used in projectors and high-definition televisions.
Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.28 in the fourth quarter and included benefits associated with a tax rate change and sequentially higher non-operating income. For the year, EPS was $1.05.
 
Separately, the company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase, which is in addition to previously announced stock repurchase authorizations.
 
"TI delivered excellent growth and improved profitability in 2004 despite a second half that was dampened by inventory adjustments," said Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer. "Most notable was our performance in wireless, DLP and high-performance analog products.
 
"Revenue from the company's wireless products grew more than $1 billion to a record $3.8 billion for the year. Almost $500 million of our wireless revenue growth came from the emerging market for 3G cell phones, and we expect another strong year in 2005.
 
"DLP and high-performance analog products solidified their roles as exceptionally strong top- and bottom-line performers with revenue growth of 79 percent and 40 percent, respectively. They also delivered profitability that was above the company average."
 
Regarding the state of the market and TI's expectations, Templeton said: "We believe distributors made good progress in reducing their inventories in the second half of 2004. Likewise, TI moved aggressively in the fourth quarter to decrease factory loadings, which
reduced our inventory by $100 million. Although this put pressure on fourth-quarter margins, we are entering 2005 with desired levels of inventory inside TI, and as a result, we anticipate factory loadings will be higher in the current quarter than they were in the fourth although normal seasonality and lower backlog lead us to expect a decline in first-quarter revenue, we are encouraged by the momentum our products have with customers and the overall health of our markets, and we intend to be well-positioned for a resumption in growth."
 
About 2005, Templeton said: "We intend to make this TI's fourth consecutive year of market share gains built on our core digital signal processing and analog product lines. The strength of our products is evident in the 5 million units of 90-nanometer devices that we have now shipped and in our single-chip wireless cell phone that began sampling in December."
 
Gross Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, gross profit of $1334 million, or 42.3 percent of revenue, decreased 10 percent sequentially due to seasonal declines in Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) and underutilization of the company's Semiconductor manufacturing assets as the company reduced inventory. Compared with the year-ago quarter, gross profit increased 12 percent due to higher revenue.
 
For the year, gross profit of $5626 million, or 44.7 percent of revenue, increased 42 percent primarily due to higher revenue.
Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense in the fourth quarter of $487 million was about even sequentially as expense reductions largely offset higher profit-sharing accruals. Compared with the year-ago quarter, R&D expense increased 9 percent primarily due to increased product development in Semiconductor, especially for wireless, as well as higher profit-sharing accruals. For the year, R&D expense of $1978 million, or 15.7 percent of revenue, increased 13 percent primarily due to increased product development in Semiconductor, especially for wireless.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the fourth quarter of $363 million increased 4 percent sequentially and 18 percent compared with the year-ago quarter due to higher profit-sharing accruals and increased levels of marketing, especially for Semiconductor products. For the year, SG&A expense of $1441 million, or 11.5 percent of revenue, increased 15 percent for the same reasons.
 
Operating Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, operating profit of $484 million, or 15.4 percent of revenue, decreased 26 percent sequentially primarily due to lower gross profit. Compared with the year-ago quarter, operating profit increased 10 percent due to higher gross profit. For the year, operating profit of $2207 million, or 17.5 percent of revenue, increased 129 percent due to higher gross profit.
In 2004, $243 million was accrued for TI's employee profit-sharing plan, including $90 million in cost of revenue, $81 million in SG&A and $72 million in R&D. No profit sharing was accrued in 2003.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net and Interest Expense (OI&E)
 
In the fourth quarter, OI&E of $86 million increased $24 million sequentially primarily due to the resolution of an open sales-tax item associated with the company's previously divested defense electronics business and, to a lesser extent, higher interest income generated from higher cash balances and higher interest rates. Compared with the year-ago period, OI&E decreased by $45 million due to lower investment gains that were offset in part by the partial settlement of matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding TI's former memory business operations, higher interest income and the resolution of an open sales-tax item for the divested defense electronics business. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company sold its remaining shares of Micron Technologies, Inc. (Micron) common stock for a pre-tax investment gain of $97 million.
 
For the year, OI&E of $235 million decreased by $89 million for the same reason cited in the year-ago quarterly comparison. In 2003, OI&E included pre-tax investment gains of $203 million from the sale of Micron stock.
 
In the fourth quarter, interest expense of $2 million decreased $2 million sequentially and $6 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, interest expense of $21 million decreased $18 million due to the company's lower debt level, which primarily resulted from TI's redemption of $400 million of notes that matured in the third quarter of 2004.
Net Income
 
In the fourth quarter, net income was $490 million, or $0.28 per share. For the year, net income was $1861 million, or $1.05 per share.
 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14 percent, lower than the previously anticipated tax rate of 21 percent due to a cumulative reduction in tax expense that primarily resulted from the resolution of several foreign tax items.
 
The effective annual tax rate for 2004 was 23 percent, lower than the previously anticipated annual tax rate of 25 percent. As expected, the revised rate reflects the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit that was signed into law on October 4, 2004.
 
Orders
 
In the fourth quarter, TI orders of $2944 million decreased 2 percent sequentially primarily due to seasonally lower demand for E&PS graphing calculators. Compared with the year-ago quarter, TI orders decreased 4 percent due to lower demand for Semiconductor products. Semiconductor orders of $2592 million were about even sequentially. Semiconductor orders declined 6 percent from the year-ago quarter primarily due to weak demand for standard products.
For the year, TI orders of $12,447 million increased 20 percent due to Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders of $10,788 million increased 22 percent, reflecting broad-based demand.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $6358 million, an increase of $741 million from the end of the third quarter and $694 million from the end of 2003. During 2004, the company used $907 million in cash to repurchase $753 million of TI common stock and to pay $154 million in dividends. In 2003, the company repurchased $284 million of TI common stock and paid $147 million in dividends.
 
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of $1297 million increased 38 percent sequentially and 22 percent from the year-ago period. For the year, cash flow from operations increased to $3138 million, up 46 percent.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $211 million declined by $119 million sequentially and $61 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, capital expenditures of $1298 million increased by $498 million. TI's capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily for equipment used in assembly and test operations, and for 90-nanometer (nm) wafer fabrication.
Depreciation in the fourth quarter of $390 million increased by $12 million sequentially and $20 million from the year-ago period. For the year, depreciation was $1479 million, an increase of $50 million.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter of $1696 million declined $269 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to lower shipments in Semiconductor in the last month of the fourth quarter compared with the last month of the third quarter, as well as seasonally lower E&PS shipments. Accounts receivable increased $245 million from the end of 2003 due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 48 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 54 at the end of the prior quarter and 47 at the end of 2003.
 
Inventory of $1256 million at the end of the fourth quarter decreased $100 million sequentially due to lower factory loadings. For the year, inventory increased by $272 million compared with the end of 2003 as the company built inventory to support higher shipment levels and to increase the company's performance in customer service metrics. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 62, down from 69 days at the end of the prior quarter and up from 56 days at the end of 2003.
 
Debt
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, TI's debt-to-total capital ratio was 0.03, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter and down from 0.07 at the end of 2003 due to retirement of debt.
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on March 7, 2005, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the first quarter of 2005, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26.
 
For 2005, TI expects: R&D to be about $2.1 billion, capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 24 percent. This outlook does not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 123(R), which is effective for quarters beginning after June 15, 2005. In addition, this outlook does not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act.
 
The restructuring charges were for actions initiated in the second quarter of 2003 and were primarily for severance and benefit costs. The charge for purchased in-process R&D costs was a result of the Radia Communications, Inc. acquisition. Investment gains were the result of the sale of shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) common stock. The loss on redemption for the first quarter of 2003 resulted from the redemption of $250 million in convertible notes.
 
 
 
 
 
Certain purchases of short-term investments and purchases of long-term cash investments amounts in the prior period statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2004, presentation.

Exhibit 99 ---------- News Release C-05011 TI Updates First-Quarter 2005 Business Outlook - - Revenue Expected between $2910 Million and $3030 Million - - EPS Expected between $0.22 and $0.24 Conference Call on TI Web Site at 4 p.m. Central Standard Time Today www.ti.com ---------- DALLAS (March 7, 2005) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the first quarter of 2005, Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN) today narrowed its expected ranges for revenue and earnings per share (EPS). The updated estimates reflect lower-than-expected demand for DLP(TM) products used in televisions and projectors. Even though TI believes DLP-based televisions and projectors gained share in 2004, customers had built for more robust end-of-year sales. Customers are taking aggressive actions to reduce these inventories as quickly as possible. Additionally, the updated estimates include the expected impact of the company's sale of its commodity liquid crystal display driver operations. This transaction should close in the month of March. As expected and previously stated, the ongoing inventory adjustments of semiconductor products in distribution channels have continued in the first quarter. These adjustments are generally on track to be completed by the end of March. The company's expectations for revenue are: - - Total revenue between $2910 million and $3030 million, compared with the prior range of $2900 million to $3140 million; - - Semiconductor revenue between $2550 million and $2650 million, compared with the prior range of $2550 million to $2750 million; - - Sensors & Controls revenue between $285 million and $295 million, compared with the prior range of $280 million to $300 million; and - - Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $75 million and $85 million, compared with the prior range of $70 million to $90 million. TI expects EPS between $0.22 and $0.24, compared with the previous range of $0.22 to $0.26. The company will hold a conference call at 4 p.m. CST today to discuss this update. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI's original first-quarter outlook was published in the company's fourth-quarter and year-end 2004 earnings release on Jan. 25, available at www.ti.com. TI's first quarter ends on March 31. # # # "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (April 18, 2005)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported revenue for the first quarter of 2005 of $2972 million, about even with the year-ago period. Sequentially, revenue decreased 6 percent as gains in the company's Sensors & Controls and Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) businesses were more than offset by an expected decline in Semiconductor.
 
Sequentially, TI's gross and operating profit margins increased despite the decline in revenue. TI's gross profit margin expanded 2.6 percentage points to 44.9 percent of revenue, and TI's operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 16.7 percent of revenue.
 
TI inventories declined slightly from the fourth quarter, a period in which they were significantly reduced by $100 million. Having adjusted inventories to desired levels during the fourth quarter, TI increased production in its Semiconductor factories in the first quarter to realign factory output with its shipments.
 
Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.24 in the first quarter.
 
"TI started 2005 with stronger profit performance despite a slower semiconductor market environment. Higher utilization of the company's owned factories as well as lower manufacturing and operating expenses were largely responsible for improved profitability in a quarter where revenue declined sequentially," said Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer.
 
"The market environment is improving. We believe the inventory correction in TI's standard semiconductor products at distributors that began in the third quarter of 2004 is complete, as demonstrated by sequential growth in revenue and orders for these products. We expect that the inventory correction associated with our DLP
TM
products used in high-definition televisions and projectors will continue into the second quarter, although the rate of reductions should subside," he said.
 
"While the overall environment for cell phones will likely support a lower growth rate than last year, we continue to have high expectations for our wireless operations in 2005. In the first quarter, TI's wireless revenue grew 15 percent from a year ago and declined 14 percent sequentially following a strong fourth quarter. Recent market reports have confirmed that TI is the world's top provider of semiconductors used in the wireless market, and we expect to gain additional share this year in the fast-growing market for 3G UMTS modems based on the strength of our digital signal processors," he said.
 
"TI aggressively repurchased its common stock during the quarter, and we are now more than halfway through the $3 billion of repurchase plans announced in September and January. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders," he said.
 
Gross Profit
 
In the first quarter, TI's gross profit of $1336 million, or 44.9 percent of revenue, was about even sequentially. Compared with a year ago, gross profit increased $14 million primarily due to higher gross profit in E&PS and a gain on the sale of assets associated with the company's commodity liquid crystal display (LCD) driver product line.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $495 million, or 16.6 percent of revenue, increased $8 million sequentially due to higher Semiconductor product development expenses and was about even with a year ago.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $344 million, or 11.6 percent of revenue, decreased $19 million sequentially and $10 million from a year ago due to the combination of a gain recognized on the disposition of a sales facility and lower expenses.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $497 million, or 16.7 percent of revenue, increased $13 million sequentially and $23 million from a year ago due to the combination of lower SG&A expenses and higher gross profit.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E of $48 million decreased $38 million sequentially primarily due to the impact in the previous quarter of a partial settlement of matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding TI's former memory business operations and the resolution of an open sales-tax item associated with the company's previously divested defense electronics business. OI&E decreased $2 million from a year ago.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $411 million, or $0.24 per share.
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24 percent, as expected, compared with the previous quarter's 14 percent tax rate that included a cumulative catch-up reduction in tax expense. The effective tax rate in the year-ago quarter was 29 percent.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3028 million increased $84 million sequentially primarily due to seasonally higher demand for E&PS graphing calculators as well as higher demand for Sensors & Controls products. Compared with a year ago, TI orders decreased $203 million due to lower demand for Semiconductor products.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the first quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $5140 million, a decrease of $1218 million from the end of the previous quarter and a decrease of $353 million from the end of the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company used $1493 million in cash to repurchase 58 million shares of TI common stock.
 
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of $523 million decreased $782 million sequentially primarily due to a significant reduction in accounts receivable in the
 
fourth quarter that was not repeated in the first quarter and payment of employee profit sharing in the first quarter for 2004 performance.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter of $277 million increased by $66 million sequentially and decreased by $124 million from a year ago. TI's capital expenditures in the first quarter were primarily for equipment used for 65- and 90-nanometer wafer fabrication, and assembly and test operations.
 
Depreciation in the first quarter of $347 million decreased $43 million sequentially and $1 million from a year ago.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of $1696 million were the same as at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable increased $18 million from the end of the year-ago quarter due to higher sales. Days sales outstanding were 51 at the end of the first quarter compared with 48 at the end of the previous quarter and 51 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventories of $1245 million at the end of the first quarter declined $11 million from the end of the previous quarter. Compared with the end of the year-ago quarter, inventories increased $97 million due to inventories the company built in the first three
 
quarters of 2004 to increase its ability to quickly deliver products to customers. Days of inventory at the end of the first quarter were 69, up from 62 days at the end of the previous quarter and 64 days at the end of the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on June 7, 2005, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the second quarter of 2005, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects EPS to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.
 
This outlook comprehends the sale of the company's commodity LCD driver product line, which was completed effective March 18, 2005. Revenue from this product line was about $200 million in 2004 and was $39 million for the abbreviated period during the first quarter of 2005 in which it was owned by TI.
 
For 2005, TI continues to expect: R&D to be about $2.1 billion, capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 24 percent, unchanged from the prior estimate. This tax rate does not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 123(R), which the company expects to implement beginning in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, this outlook does not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act.

Exhibit 99 ---------- NEWS RELEASE C-05032 DELAWARE SUPREME COURT RULES IN TI'S FAVOR, AFFIRMS LOWER COURT RULING TI Retains Rights to Qualcomm Patents DALLAS (June 9, 2005) -- The Delaware Supreme Court has affirmed the ruling of the Delaware Court of Chancery, by a 5-0 vote, rejecting a claim by Qualcomm Incorporated that Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN) materially breached the parties' cross-license agreement. Qualcomm had appealed a ruling by Chancellor William B. Chandler, III of the Delaware Court of Chancery, issued in June last year. In that ruling, the court rejected an assertion by Qualcomm that TI materially breached the cross-license agreement that has existed between the companies since December 2000. The Delaware Supreme Court heard the appeal April 20 and in its finding, dated June 8, affirmed the Court of Chancery ruling that no such material breach of the agreement occurred. With Qualcomm having abandoned in August 2004 a previous claim for damages, the latest ruling disposes of all outstanding claims in the existing litigation between the parties. The license rights of each party under the cross-license agreement remain in effect. "We are pleased that the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the Court of Chancery's ruling in TI's favor on these issues. We believe that this was the correct outcome," said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Joseph F. Hubach. # # # ABOUT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS Texas Instruments Incorporated provides innovative DSP and Analog technologies to meet our customers' real world signal processing requirements.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (July 25, 2005)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported revenue for the second quarter of $3239 million, up 9 percent sequentially and about even with the year-ago quarter. The sequential growth primarily was due to increased demand for the company's analog and DSP semiconductor products. Also contributing to growth was the seasonal increase in demand for calculators from TI's Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) business.
 
Operating profit of $669 million, an all-time high, reflected stronger gross profit as well as tight control of operating expenses. TI's gross profit margin expanded 2.1 percentage points sequentially to 47.0 percent of revenue, and TI's operating margin increased 3.9 percentage points to 20.6 percent of revenue.
 
Earnings per share (EPS) in the second quarter were $0.38, which includes a net benefit of $0.06 from tax-related items.
 
Separately, the company announced plans to increase its dividend by 20 percent to an annual dividend payment of $0.12 per share effective with the October 2005 dividend declaration. Also, the Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase, which is in addition to previously announced stock repurchase authorizations.
 
"Our strong growth underscores the importance of DSP and analog to a wide range of electronics equipment," said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. "We believe that revenue from our broad portfolio of advanced DSP and analog products outpaced the results of our competitors.
 
"Good products, good execution and good cost control led to record operating profit," he said. "Our operations continued to produce significant cash, and we were well-positioned to repurchase the company's stock in the second quarter. We repurchased an additional 52 million shares in the quarter, or a total of 110 million shares since the beginning of the year.
 
"We're also encouraged that the inventory correction that affected our DLP product revenue in the first half of the year is now complete. DLP revenue grew 10 percent sequentially, and we expect it will contribute to growth again in the third quarter," he said. "High-performance analog turned in another strong quarter with 13 percent sequential growth. DSP revenue grew 8 percent sequentially driven by strong growth in wireless applications. Total revenue from the wireless market increased 8 percent as a result of our leading position in the fast-growing 3G market. With Semiconductor orders up 15 percent sequentially in the second quarter and the book-to-bill ratio at 1.07, we believe the company will deliver solid growth again in the third quarter."
 
Gross Profit
 
In the second quarter, TI's gross profit of $1521 million, or 47.0 percent of revenue, increased $185 million sequentially due to higher gross profit from Semiconductor and E&PS. Compared with a year ago, gross profit increased $40 million for the same reason.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $493 million, or 15.2 percent of revenue, decreased $2 million sequentially. R&D expense declined $21 million from a year ago due to a lower accrual for profit sharing.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $359 million, or 11.1 percent of revenue, increased $15 million sequentially primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a sales facility in the first quarter as well as seasonally higher marketing expenses in E&PS. SG&A decreased $16 million from a year ago primarily due to a lower profit-sharing accrual.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $669 million, or 20.6 percent of revenue, increased $172 million sequentially due to higher gross profit, and increased $77 million from a year ago due to higher gross profit as well as lower operating expenses.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E of $56 million increased $8 million sequentially primarily due to adjustments to previously accrued interest expense related to favorable developments on several outstanding tax matters, partially offset by reduced interest income on lower cash balances. OI&E increased $18 million from a year ago primarily due to these adjustments.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $628 million, or $0.38 per share.
 
The net tax benefit recognized during the second quarter includes the previously mentioned favorable developments on outstanding tax matters, partially offset by the tax expense associated with the planned repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. The company intends to invest these repatriated earnings in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Including these items, the overall tax rate for the second quarter was about 13 percent. The ongoing effective annual tax rate, excluding these items, was about 24 percent.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3389 million increased $361 million sequentially and $136 million from a year ago due to higher demand for Semiconductor products.
 
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations of $827 million increased $304 million sequentially primarily due to payment of employee profit sharing in the first quarter for 2004 performance and higher net income, partially offset by a seasonal increase in accounts receivable. Cash flow from operations increased $321 million from a year ago due to higher net income and lower inventories.
 
At the end of the second quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $4478 million, down $662 million from the end of the previous quarter and $1056 million from the end of the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company used $1292 million in cash to repurchase 52 million shares of TI common stock.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $257 million decreased $20 million sequentially and $99 million from a year ago. TI's capital expenditures in the second quarter were primarily for construction of TI's new 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in Texas, as well as semiconductor assembly-and-test equipment and advanced wafer-fabrication equipment.
 
Depreciation of $345 million decreased $2 million sequentially and $18 million from a year ago.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable of $1902 million at the end of the second quarter increased $206 million sequentially due to seasonally higher E&PS receivables and higher revenue. Accounts receivable decreased $28 million from the end of the year-ago quarter. Days sales outstanding were 53 at the end of the second quarter compared with 51 at the end of the previous quarter and 54 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventories of $1202 million at the end of the second quarter decreased $43 million from the end of the previous quarter due to strong shipments, and decreased $83 million from the end of the year-ago quarter due to lower factory loadings. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter were 63 compared with 69 at the end of the previous quarter and 66 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on Sept. 8, 2005, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the third quarter of 2005, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35. This estimate includes the expensing of employee stock options, which TI will initiate in the third quarter as previously announced. This expense is expected to be about $80 million in the third quarter, or $0.03 per share.
 
For 2005, TI continues to expect: R&D to be about $2.1 billion, capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion. The ongoing effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be about 24 percent.

TI plans to repurchase shares at times and prices considered appropriate by the company. TI has nearly completed its previously authorized buyback programs, totaling $3 billion.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (October 24, 2005)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported record quarterly revenue of $3.59 billion, an increase of 11 percent sequentially and 10 percent over the third quarter of last year. Growth was driven by the company's Semiconductor segment, which was up 13 percent sequentially and 13 percent from a year ago with particularly strong demand for digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog chips that are used in a variety of communications and entertainment electronics.
 
Earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter were $0.38. As previously announced, the company began expensing stock options in the third quarter, and as a result, EPS included $0.03 of additional expense for stock-based compensation. For comparison purposes, it is important to note that equivalent stock-based compensation expense was not reflected in any prior quarterly period. EPS also included $0.01 for higher-than-anticipated taxes in the quarter.
 
In addition to record revenue, TI reached new highs for gross margin at 49.3 percent, for operating margin at 22.7 percent, and for operating cash flow at $1.51 billion. "This
 
performance is especially significant as semiconductor inventories declined at TI and distributors," said Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Additionally, TI continued to gain share in areas with sustainable long-term growth," he said. "Wireless revenue grew 16 percent sequentially and 20 percent from a year ago; high-performance analog revenue grew 10 percent sequentially and 16 percent from a year ago; and DLP
product revenue grew 41 percent sequentially and was even with a year ago.
 
"TI continues to hold leadership positions in semiconductors for both the high and low ends of the cell phone market. For solutions used in feature-rich 3G UMTS cell phones, revenue remains on track to exceed $1 billion in 2005. In low-priced cell phones, TI's solutions are penetrating markets such as China, India, Brazil and Africa, changing the way people communicate.
 
"In high-performance analog, our leadership products in data converters, power management and amplifiers continue to attract new customers and yield solid results. And in DLP products, we recovered from an inventory correction in the first half of the year and moved into a strong third quarter," Templeton said.
 
"In summary, this was an excellent quarter. We are fortunate to have a unique position with leadership in multiple markets and a business model that allows us to invest in critical R&D yet generate high levels of operating cash flow. We remain focused on making our customers successful and on returning value to our shareholders," Templeton concluded.
 
Gross Profit
 
In the third quarter, TI's gross profit was a record $1.77 billion, or 49.3 percent of revenue. This included the impact of $16 million, or 0.5 percent of revenue, of stock-based
 
compensation expense. Gross profit increased $250 million sequentially and $282 million from a year ago due to higher gross profit in the company's Semiconductor segment.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $527 million, or 14.7 percent of revenue, increased $34 million sequentially and $44 million from a year ago primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, which was $26 million in the quarter. The change from a year ago also included higher product development expenses, primarily for analog and DSP semiconductors that go into cell phones.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $429 million, or 12.0 percent of revenue, increased $70 million sequentially and $80 million from a year ago primarily due to compensation expense as well as higher marketing expense. Stock-based compensation expense in SG&A was $40 million in the third quarter.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $815 million and operating margin of 22.7 percent of revenue were all-time highs for the company. Operating profit increased $146 million sequentially and $158 million from a year ago due to higher gross profit. Operating profit reflected the impact of $82 million, or 2.3 percent of revenue, of stock-based compensation expense, which was included in corporate activities.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E of $49 million decreased $7 million sequentially and $13 million from a year ago primarily due to favorable items included in the previous periods. OI&E in the second quarter included a tax interest benefit, and the year-ago quarter included a significant favorable settlement with the Italian government regarding TI's former memory-chip operations.
 
Net Income
 
Net income was $631 million. EPS of $0.38, which includes $0.03 of stock-based compensation expense and $0.01 of higher-than-anticipated taxes, was even with the second quarter. EPS in the second quarter included $0.06 of nonrecurring tax-related benefits.
 
Compared with a year ago, EPS increased $0.06 due to higher operating profit.
 
The 27 percent effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than the previously expected 24 percent rate due to a revision in the estimated annual effective tax rate and the associated cumulative adjustment.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3.74 billion increased $351 million sequentially and $721 million from a year ago due to higher demand for Semiconductor products.
 
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations of $1.51 billion increased $687 million sequentially and $572 million from a year ago.
 
At the end of the third quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) was $5.25 billion, up $773 million from the end of
 
the previous quarter and down $366 million from the end of the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company used $496 million in cash to repurchase 15 million shares of TI common stock. Over the past 12 months, TI has repurchased 140 million shares of common stock and paid $169 million in dividends.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $450 million increased $193 million sequentially and $120 million from a year ago. TI's capital expenditures in the third quarter were primarily for assembly and test equipment, advanced wafer fabrication equipment and building the company's new 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas.
 
Depreciation of $339 million decreased $6 million sequentially and $39 million from a year ago.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable of $1.92 billion at the end of the third quarter increased $13 million sequentially due to higher revenue, partially offset by seasonally lower receivables in the company's E&PS business. Accounts receivable decreased $50 million from the end of the year-ago quarter. Days sales outstanding were 48 at the end of the third quarter compared with 53 at the end of the previous quarter and 54 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventories of $1.16 billion at the end of the third quarter decreased $44 million sequentially due to stronger-than-expected shipments, which reduced inventory to less-than-desired levels. Inventory decreased $198 million from a year ago when inventories were higher than
 
desired. Days of inventory at the end of the third quarter were 57 compared with 63 at the end of the previous quarter and 69 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on December 7, 2005, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2005, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. This estimate includes about $0.03 for stock-based compensation expense.

Seller will promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies received by Seller under any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an Excluded Asset.

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Items or amounts in order to determine Closing Working Capital. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter jointly retain the Accounting Referee and cause the Accounting Referee promptly to review this Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only the Disputed Items, and the determination of the Accounting Referee with respect to each Disputed Item shall be an amount within the range established with respect to such Disputed Item by Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(a), on the one hand, and Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(b), on the other hand. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller (absent manifest error). The cost of such review and report shall be borne (i) by Seller if the difference between Final Working Capital and Closing Working Capital as set forth in Seller's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(a) is greater than the difference between Final Working Capital and Closing Working Capital as set forth in Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(b), (ii) by Buyer if the first such difference is less than the second such difference and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

interest as provided in Section 2.11(b), the amount of such excess. "
Final Working Capital
" means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(a) if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(c);
provided
that in no event shall Final Working Capital be more than Seller's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or less than Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.10(b).
     
(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after Final Working Capital has been determined by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of such other party as may be designated by such other party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal
in effect as of the Closing Date. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Subject to the satisfaction by Seller of its obligations pursuant to Section 5.02, the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 and 10.02 (other than Section 10.02(e)) and the conditions to funding set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than conditions the nonsatisfaction of which is solely the result of the failure of the Equity Financing to be consummated), Buyer will draw down on the Bridge Loans, the Senior Bridge Loans and the Senior Subordinated Bridge Loans (in each case, as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) if adequate funding has not been obtained through the issuance of the Subordinated Notes and the Notes (in each case, as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and the senior secured portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, as necessary to enable the Debt Financing to be funded on or prior to the later of (A) May 31, 2006 and (B) the earlier of (1) June 30, 2006 and (2) the 30

Buyer will give Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. To the extent reasonably requested by Seller, Buyer will keep Seller informed on a current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. Buyer will not agree to any material amendment or modification to, or grant or seek any waiver under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting with Seller and, if such amendment, modification or waiver would or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or delay in any material respect

increases a tax asset relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax Liability or, when realized, the amount of any benefit resulting from such increase in tax assets, as the case may be. Any amount required to be paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section 8.02(f) shall be reduced by the amount of any increase in Taxes of a Purchased Subsidiary as a result of the receipt of such refund, reduction in Tax Liability or increase in tax assets.

provided
that such individual so returns within six months following the Closing Date (in this regard, Buyer or such Subsidiary shall make any reasonable accommodation required under Applicable Law to accommodate the disability that resulted in such individual being on such short-term disability). Unless a written acceptance of an offer of employment is required by Applicable Law, a Business Employee who continues employment or who has received an offer shall be deemed to have accepted such continuance or offer, unless such Business Employee specifically declines such continuance or offer. Business Employees described in clause (i) who continue such employment and Business Employees described in clause (ii) (including in each case any Business Employees returning from short-term disability) who accept such offer
of employment shall collectively be the "
Transferred Employees

less
(z) the Initial Pension Amount;
the "

Buyer and Seller shall each use reasonable efforts to effect the asset and liability transfers contemplated in this Section 9.02(c) as soon as reasonably practicable;
provided

(v) Buyer shall cause the Buyer DB Plan to credit each DB Participant with full past service credit for eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and all other purposes from his or her date of employment (adjusted to reflect breaks in service in accordance with the provisions of the Seller DB Plan) with Seller and its Affiliates to the extent such service was credited on behalf of such DB Participant under the Seller DB Plan; and
     
(vi) Seller shall provide Buyer with all information requested by Buyer with respect to DB Participants and up to 10 other participants in the Seller DB Plan that is reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of the liabilities for such DB Participants used to determine the amount of assets transferred from the Seller DB Plan to the Buyer DB Plan as contemplated in Section 9.02(c)(iii).
     
(d) (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover (or will cause to be covered), effective as of the Closing Date and for the Relevant Period, each Transferred Employee (U.S.) under one or more other defined contribution plans and trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively, the "
Buyer DC Plan
") on the same basis as similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (
provided
that to the extent that Buyer and its Subsidiaries do not have similarly situated employees, the basis on which Transferred Employees (U.S.) shall participate in the Buyer DC Plan as of the Closing Date shall be substantially comparable to the basis on which they participated in any defined contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that is sponsored by Seller or any of its Affiliates as in effect immediately prior to the Closing (the "
Seller DC Plan
")) and on terms that reflect the service credit provisions of Section 9.02(f) . Effective as of the Closing Date or any subsequent date reasonably requested by Buyer (no later than the 60
th

provided
that any such direct rollover shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Buyer DC Plan applicable to rollover contributions. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall amend and take any other action, or cause to be amended or have any other action taken, including requesting the approval of the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, if necessary, to vest any account balances in respect of Transferred Employees (U.S.) in the Seller DC Plan that are unvested as of the Closing Date and make to the Seller DC Plan the
pro rata
portion of employer contributions, if any, in respect of Transferred Employees (U.S.) through the date immediately prior to the Closing; and
     
(ii) all Liabilities associated with any participants of the Seller DC Plan (other than Liabilities associated with Transferred Employees (U.S.) who elect a direct rollover of account balances as contemplated in this Section 9.02(d) and for whom such direct rollover is effected) shall remain the responsibility of Seller.

(i) effective on the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee (Non-U.S.) who is an active participant in a Seller International Retirement Plan shall be vested in his or her accrued benefit earned through the Closing Date;
     
(ii) effective on the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee (Non-U.S.) who is an active participant in a Seller International Retirement Plan shall cease to be an active participant under such International Retirement Plan and shall become a participant in one or more retirement plans established or designated by Buyer (collectively, the "
Buyer International Retirement Plan
");
     
(iii) as soon as practicable after the Closing, Seller shall cause the transfer from each Seller International Retirement Plan to the Buyer International Retirement Plan of assets and liabilities which are attributable to the Transferred Employees (Non-U.S.) who are participants as of the Closing Date in a Seller International Retirement Plan, where permissible by Applicable Law. Subject to Section 9.02(e)(iv), the amount of assets to be transferred (the "
International Transfer Amount
") shall be the amount determined as of the Closing Date, using service and compensation as of the Closing Date, and on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Seller International Retirement Plan. Such determination of the amount to be transferred shall be made by Seller's actuary and verified by Buyer's actuary (such verification not be unreasonably withheld). Buyer's actuary may comment with respect to the determination of the amount to be so transferred, and any such comments shall, in good faith, be taken into account by Seller's actuary. Within a reasonable period of time before the transfer, Seller's actuary shall provide such other information as may be reasonably necessary to
permit Buyer's actuary to comment with respect to the determination of such amount. In the event that the trustee of the Seller International Retirement Plan is precluded from Applicable Law from transferring an amount equal to the International Transfer Amount, the transfer from the Seller International Retirement Plan to the Buyer International Retirement Plan shall be limited as required by Applicable Law, and Seller shall separately pay to Buyer any difference between the Transfer Amount and the maximum asset transfer as subsequently determined under Applicable Law;

(vi) if a transfer in accordance with Section 9.02(e)(iii) is not permissible, and a Transferred Employee (Non-U.S.) transfers his or her pension rights to a Buyer International Retirement Plan following the Closing Date, the amount of assets to be transferred (or any additional amount required to be transferred by Seller as a result of a shortfall) with respect to him or her shall be determined by this Section 9.02(e);
provided
that the amount so transferred shall not be less than the amount required to be transferred under Applicable Law.
     
(f) Buyer shall grant (or will cause to be granted) each Transferred Employee credit for years of prior service with the Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective predecessors for all purposes (other than for any purpose under any equity-based plan or arrangement) to the extent and for the purposes credited under an analogous Employee Plan or International Plan prior to the Closing Date;
provided
that no service credit shall be granted to the extent any duplication of benefits results.
     
(g) Effective as of the Closing Date (or such later date as may be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement;
provided

benefit plan is maintained solely for the employees of a Purchased Subsidiary or one of its Subsidiaries) (each, a "
Seller Welfare Plan
") and commence participation in the health and welfare benefit plans maintained, administered or contributed to by Buyer and its Subsidiaries (each, a "
Buyer Welfare Plan
"). Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) shall be responsible for claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date. All claims incurred under a Buyer Welfare Plan for Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Section 9.02(g), the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death or accident giving rise to such benefits; (ii) health or medical, dental, vision care and/or prescription drug benefits, upon provision of such services, materials or supplies; and (iii) short- and long-term disability benefits, upon the event that gives rise to the disability. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the provisions of Section 9.01 pertaining to U.S. Business Employees on short-term disability, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that (A) any Business Employee who as of the Closing Date is receiving short-term or long-term disability benefits (or who has satisfied the requirements for receiving such benefits), shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as applicable, to receive such benefits under Seller's short-term or long-term disability plan, as applicable, unless and until such individual is no longer disabled, and (B) Seller shall be solely liable for any other liabilities, obligations or commitments arising in connection with any Business Employee who is receiving long-term disability benefits (or who has satisfied the requirements for receiving such benefits) as of the Closing Date.

(i) where reasonably possible during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees (U.S.) under any health and welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees (U.S.) are eligible to participate after the Closing Date to the extent that such limitations were waived under the applicable Employee Plan; and
     
(ii) where reasonably possible, provide each Transferred Employee (U.S.) with credit during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any health and welfare plans that such Transferred Employees (U.S.) are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.
     
(i) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer from medical and dependent care account plans of Seller and any of its Affiliates (other than a Purchased Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries) (each, a "

Buyer FSA Plan
") the account balances in respect of 2006 (
provided
that the Closing Date occurs in 2006) of Transferred Employees (U.S.), and Buyer shall be responsible for the obligations of the Seller FSA Plans to provide benefits to Transferred Employees (U.S.) with respect to such transferred account balances on or after the Closing Date. Each Transferred Employee (U.S.) shall be permitted to continue to have payroll deductions made as most recently elected by him or her under the applicable Seller FSA Plan. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for benefits paid by the Seller FSA Plans in respect of claims incurred in 2006 (
provided

provided
that in order to receive an enhanced severance benefit such Transferred Employee (U.S.) executes, delivers and does not revoke a general release in favor of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates.
     
(k) Any Transferred Employee (U.S.) shall carry over to Buyer or one of its Affiliates any "banked" time that he or she has accrued as of immediately prior to the Closing under the policy of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to paid time-off. With respect to any such Transferred Employee (U.S.) whose accrued "banked" time at the end of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs is in excess of the amount of "banked" time that such Transferred Employee (U.S.) would have been entitled to accrue during an 18-month period under the
policy of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to paid time-off (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing), Buyer may, at its election, pay (or may cause to be paid) cash to such Transferred Employee (U.S.) in lieu of such excess accrued "banked" time in accordance with the policy of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the cash-out of excess "banked" time (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing), and any such excess accrued "banked" time that is not so cashed out shall continue to be carried over. With respect to any such Transferred Employee (U.S.) whose employment terminates for any reason, Buyer shall pay cash to such Transferred Employee (U.S.) in lieu of any accrued "banked" time that he or she has accrued as of the effective date of such termination in accordance with the policy of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the cash-out of accrued time "banked" by terminated employees (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing). The treatment of any accrued but unused vacation, sick or personal leave or time-off in respect of any Transferred Employee (Non-U.S.) shall be in accordance with Applicable Law.

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or designate, effective as of the Closing Date, a retiree medical plan and a VEBA or VEBAs which shall be qualified under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (collectively, the "") on behalf of Transferred Employees (U.S.), and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to effect such establishment or designation as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date;

The amount of assets accumulated to provide retiree medical
benefits in the Seller's account VEBA(s) that will be transferred shall be the aggregate amount of assets in the Seller's VEBA(s),
multiplied b
y a fraction, the numerator of which is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) in the Seller Retiree Medical Plan for the Transferred Employees (U.S.) (and their spouses and other dependents, if any) immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the APBO for all participants and their spouses and other dependents (if any) in the Seller Retiree Medical Plan, including Transferred Employees (U.S.) (and their spouses and other dependents, if any) at such date. The plan provisions, census data, valuation methods and actuarial assumptions used to determine the APBO shall be the same as those used by Seller to determine the SFAS 106 curtailment charge for the transactions contemplated hereby. The assets to be transferred shall be credited with earnings on the balance outstanding from time to time at the rate of earnings of the entire trust on assets of the Seller's VEBA(s) during the period from the Closing Date to the last day of the month ending prior to the actual date(s) of transfer,
minus
a portion of expenses paid from the trust proportional to the amount of assets to be transferred in relation to the total amount of assets of the Seller's VEBA(s) prior to the transfer, and further reduced by any benefit payments made in respect of Transferred Employees (U.S.) (and their spouses and other dependents, if any) prior to the actual date(s) of transfer. Buyer and Seller shall each use reasonable efforts to effect the asset and liability transfers contemplated in this Section 9.02(l) as soon as reasonably practicable;
     
(iv) all Liabilities associated with any participants of the Seller Retiree Medical Plan (other than Liabilities associated with Transferred Employees (U.S.) and their spouses and other dependants, if any, upon the asset and liability transfers contemplated in this Section 9.02(l)) shall remain the responsibility of Seller;

(vi) Seller shall provide Buyer with all information requested by Buyer with respect to Transferred Employees (U.S.) and up to 10 other participants in the Seller Retiree Medical Plan that is reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of the liabilities for such Transferred Employees used to determine the amount of assets transferred from the Seller Retiree
Medical Plan to the Buyer Retiree Medical Plan as contemplated by Section 9.02(l)(iii);
     
(vii) the assets transferred pursuant to Section 9.02(l)(iii) plus all future investment earnings thereon shall be exclusively used to pay for retiree medical benefits and related administration costs for Transferred Employees (U.S.) (and their spouses or other dependents, if any) and, for so long as the provisions of the Buyer Retiree Medical Plan are substantially the same as those of the Seller Retiree Medical Plan (as of the Closing Date) for other employees (including spouses and other dependents thereof) of the Business to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; and
     
(viii) for the avoidance of doubt, effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees (U.S.) shall be eligible to receive benefits under the Buyer Retiree Medical Plan and shall not be eligible to receive benefits under the Seller Retiree Medical Plan.

Baskets
") and (ii) the Seller Cap and Buyer Cap (collectively, the "
Caps
")) and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

(b) Seller shall control and appoint lead counsel for the defense of any claim asserted by any third party (a "
Third Party Claim
") that is an Excluded Liability. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control and
appoint lead counsel for the defense of any Third Party Claim or any Environmental Matter if (i) it is reasonably expected that indemnification payments to be made by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter in accordance with Section 11.02 (taking into account the Baskets and the Caps) will be greater than the harm suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of such Third Party Claim, including any injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief sought by such third party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Damages relating to such Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter (subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Article 11, including the Baskets and the Caps) and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party that it has elected to assume such defense promptly but in any event within 30 days after receipt of the notice with respect to such Third Party Claim referred to in Section 11.02(a) or, with respect to Environmental Matters, in a timely manner given the facts and circumstances and changes thereto or development thereof over time (it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to take such actions as may be required to defend such Third Party Claim, including if necessary seeking extensions of time to respond to pleadings and the like, prior to the receipt of such acknowledgement within the 30-day period referred to above). The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or fails to, elect to assume the defense of such claim pursuant to the foregoing sentence, or thereafter if the Indemnifying Party fails or ceases to prosecute such claim with reasonable diligence.
     
(c) The party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03 (the "
Controlling Party
") (i) shall pay all the costs of such defense (including attorneys' fees),

Non-Controlling Party
") before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld (A) if the settlement does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Non-Controlling Party or (B) with respect to Environmental Matters, if the settlement is consistent with the terms of Section 11.03(g) . The Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Non-Controlling Party, unless in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Non-Controlling Party there is a conflict of interest between the Controlling Party and the Non-Controlling Party, in which case such fees and expenses shall be paid by the Controlling Party (
provided
that if the Indemnified Party is the Controlling
Party, then such fees and expenses shall be considered Damages arising out of such Third Party Claim for purposes of Section 11.02) . In any Third Party Claim where an Indemnified Party is the Non-Controlling Party and which involves any material customer or supplier of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, such participation shall in any event include the right of the Non-Controlling Party to engage in direct discussions with the other parties to such Third Party Claim, including discussions concerning the claim and the potential resolution thereof;
provided
that (1) such participation right shall not alter the rights of the Controlling Party to control and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, including the right to reject or accept any resolution proposed by the Non-Controlling Party in such Controlling Party's sole discretion, and (2) the Non-Controlling Party shall disclose to such other parties that in conducting any such discussions, the Non-Controlling Party is acting on its own behalf and not as a Representative of the Controlling Party and the Non-Controlling Party is not authorized to agree to any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim. With respect to any Third Party Claim relating to the Specified Matters, the Controlling Party shall retain the legal counsel identified in Section 11.03(c) of the Disclosure Schedule with respect thereto and shall not replace or discharge such counsel absent good cause.
     
(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

A Controlling Party shall, to the extent requested by the Non-Controlling Party, (i) keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed relating to the progress of any significant matter (including providing the Non-Controlling Party with periodic summaries of the status of such Third Party Claim and the amounts spent with respect thereto and copies of all material plans, reports and external correspondence and notifying the Non-Controlling Party of, and giving the Non-Controlling Party the opportunity to attend, scheduled voice or in-person conferences with regulators or other third parties) and (ii) provide the Non-Controlling Party with a reasonable period of time, given the specific circumstances, to permit such party to comment on any material proposed actions, and to consider in good faith any such comments.

Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received.
     
(f) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

(iii) Each party agrees to cooperate, and to cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Environmental Matter and shall provide to the other party with copies of
any and all material environmental audits, studies, action plans, tests and communications with any Governmental Agency or third party relating to investigatory, remedial or other activities with respect to any property which may be subject to a claim for indemnification for any Environmental Matters;
     
(iv) Seller's obligation to indemnify Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be limited to those Damages which must be incurred, based upon (1) the use of a reasonable and cost-effective method available under the circumstances and (2) the industrial or commercial use of the property as of the Closing Date, to meet, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the requirements of any applicable Environmental Law or to meet the demands of any applicable Governmental Authority or as required by any judicial or administrative resolution, order or settlement agreement of a Third Party Claim otherwise complying with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in this Section, Buyer and its Affiliates agree that engineering or institutional controls and a deed or other restriction are each a reasonable cost-effective method, so long as such control or restriction does not materially limit the industrial or commercial activities being performed on the applicable property as of the Closing Date
.

(B) Buyer or any of its Affiliates reasonably believes that it (or any Third Party Buyer) must investigate, take action, initiate or encourage any such action to meet the demands of a reasonable third party buyer or its financing parties (collectively, "
Third Party Buyers

In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to fully utilize, at the highest applicable marginal tax rate then in effect, all Tax items arising from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Damages, with such Tax items to be the last items taken into account. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.
     
(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i) Damages to the extent that the Liability relating thereto has been taken into account as a liability in calculating Final Working Capital pursuant to the

"This agreement is about unlocking value," said TI President and Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton. "TI will intensify its focus on our high-growth core digital signal processing and analog semiconductor opportunities, while Sensors & Controls will have greater access to the investment and strategic resources it needs to fuel its future growth."
"Sensors & Controls is a market leader that enjoys long-standing customer relationships and is geographically diversified with greater than 50 percent of its sales generated outside North America," said Steve Zide, a Managing Director at Bain Capital. "We're enthusiastic about Sensors & Controls' future, and look forward to supporting the management team's plan to continue the company's growth and realize its long-term potential." Bain Capital has a strong track record of purchasing non-core divisions of large, multinational companies and partnering with the management team and employees to build significant value.
Thomas Wroe, Jr., the president of Sensors & Controls, and the current
management team will continue to lead the organization. "We are eager to start this new chapter in our history," said Wroe. "We have made tremendous strides improving profitability while growing the business. This transaction will allow us to accelerate our growth and serve our customers more effectively."
TI's Board of Directors has approved the sale, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006. Completion of the sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals.
Bain Capital was advised on the transaction by JPMorgan Chase and the financing will be provided by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs. TI was advised by Morgan Stanley and a fairness opinion was provided to the company by Lazard.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DALLAS (Jan. 23, 2006)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 of $3.59 billion, up 14 percent from the year-ago quarter as growth in the Semiconductor segment accelerated. Fourth-quarter revenue was even with the third quarter of 2005 as growth in semiconductors was offset by the expected seasonal decline of graphing calculator sales in the Educational & Productivity Solutions segment. For the year, TI revenue reached a record $13.39 billion, an increase of 6 percent. TI also set a new high for operating margin of 20.8 percent.
 
The company's Semiconductor segment reported growth of 3 percent sequentially for revenue of $3.23 billion, a new quarterly record, and expanded its operating margin to a second consecutive quarterly high. Semiconductor revenue grew 15 percent from the year-ago quarter due to demand for TI's digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog chips used in high-growth communications and entertainment electronics.
 
Earnings per share were $0.40 in the fourth quarter and were $1.39 for the year. Earnings per share include stock-based compensation expense of $0.03 in the fourth quarter and $0.07 for the year. The company began expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005 and, therefore, equivalent stock-based compensation expense was not reflected in prior periods.
 
Separately, the company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $5 billion stock repurchase. This authorization is in addition to previously announced stock repurchase authorizations.
 
"2005 was TI's 75
th
year in operation, and as we crossed that milestone we delivered record annual results for revenue, operating profit, operating margin and operating cash flow," said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. "We also gained market share in our core semiconductor technologies of DSP and analog for the fourth consecutive year.
 
"Highlights for 2005 include a reinforced leadership position in semiconductors for wireless cell phones. We solidly achieved our goal to exceed $1 billion of semiconductor revenue in the newest cell-phone generation, known as 3G, by doubling our shipments of OMAP
TM
application processors and almost tripling our shipments of baseband modems. Other highlights include initial shipments of a new family of DSPs for digital video known as DaVinci
TM
, our agreement to acquire radio frequency expert Chipcon for high-performance analog, customer sampling of our multi-mode UMTS chipset for wireless cell phones, and strong consumer acceptance of our DLP
technology in 1080p high-definition televisions.
 
"TI enters 2006 in excellent health. Customer and channel inventories appear lean, and demand is solid. Overall, the combination of our customers, products and manufacturing abilities will enable us to keep evolving TI into a company that produces superior revenue and earnings growth on a sustained basis."
 
Gross Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, TI's gross profit was $1.73 billion, or 48.3 percent of revenue. Gross profit declined $37 million from the third quarter due to a seasonal decline in the Educational & Productivity Solutions segment, which more than offset gross profit increases in the Semiconductor and Sensors & Controls segments. Gross profit increased $400 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher gross margin in Semiconductor.
 
For the year, gross profit of $6.36 billion, or 47.5 percent of revenue, increased 13 percent, primarily due to higher gross margin in the company's Semiconductor segment.
 
Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $17 million in the fourth quarter and $33 million for the year 2005.
 
Operating Expenses
 
In the fourth quarter, research and development (R&D) expense of $500 million, or 13.9 percent of revenue, decreased $27 million sequentially, primarily due to seasonally lower pay and benefits as employees observed holidays and took vacation time. R&D increased $13 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, R&D expense of $2.02 billion, or 15.0 percent of revenue, increased $37 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D was $27 million in the fourth quarter and $53 million in 2005.
 
In the fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $424 million, or 11.8 percent of revenue, decreased $5 million sequentially as seasonally lower pay and benefits offset higher semiconductor marketing expenses. SG&A increased $61 million from a year ago. For the year, SG&A expense of $1.56 billion, or 11.6 percent of
 
revenue, increased 8 percent. Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A was $42 million in the fourth quarter and $92 million in 2005.
 
Operating Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, operating profit of $810 million, or 22.6 percent of revenue, was about even sequentially as the seasonal decline in the Educational & Productivity Solutions segment offset strong contribution from the Semiconductor segment. Operating profit increased $326 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher operating margin in Semiconductor. Semiconductor operating margin was 28.1 percent of revenue, an increase of 11.0 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
 
For the year, operating profit of $2.79 billion, or 20.8 percent of revenue, increased 26 percent due to higher operating margin in Semiconductor. Semiconductor operating margin of 23.9 percent of revenue increased 5.2 percentage points from the prior year.
 
Total stock-based compensation expense of $86 million in the fourth quarter and $178 million in 2005 was included in corporate activities.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E of $51 million increased $2 million sequentially, and decreased $35 million from a year ago primarily due to favorable resolution of an open sales-tax item in the year-ago quarter.
 
For the year, OI&E of $206 million decreased by $29 million primarily due to lower income from settlements with the Italian government related to the company's former memory-chip operations.
 
Net Income
 
In the fourth quarter, net income was $655 million or $0.40 per share, including $0.03 of stock-based compensation expense. For the year, net income was $2.32 billion, or $1.39 per share, including $0.07 of stock-based compensation expense. The overall tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 24 percent for the fourth quarter and 22 percent for the year.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3.77 billion increased $27 million sequentially and $823 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand for Semiconductor products. For the year, TI orders of $13.92 billion increased 12 percent as demand grew for the company's Semiconductor products.
 
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations of $908 million decreased $606 million sequentially and $389 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, cash flow from operations increased 20 percent to $3.77 billion.
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $5.34 billion, up $84 million from the end of the previous quarter and down $1.02 billion from the end of the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company repurchased $870 million of TI common stock and paid $48 million in dividends. During 2005, the company repurchased $4.15 billion of TI common stock, reducing average diluted shares outstanding by almost 100 million shares, and paid $173 million
 
in dividends. In 2004, the company repurchased $753 million of TI common stock, and paid $154 million in dividends.
 
In 2005, to avail the company of tax savings provided for under the American Jobs Creation Act, TI repatriated $1.3 billion of previously undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter, TI's Japan subsidiary borrowed $275 million in order to facilitate this process.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $346 million decreased $104 million sequentially and increased $135 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, capital expenditures of $1.33 billion increased by $32 million. TI's capital expenditures in the fourth quarter and the year were primarily for assembly and test equipment, advanced wafer fabrication equipment and construction of the company's new 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas.
 
Depreciation of $344 million increased $5 million sequentially and decreased $46 million from a year ago. For the year, depreciation was $1.38 billion, a decrease of $104 million.
 
Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, TI will change its method of depreciation from an accelerated to a straight-line method on its existing and future property, plant and equipment assets. This change is the result of a study that was conducted regarding the usage pattern of TI's long-lived depreciable assets. The study indicated a trend toward more consistent utilization of assets as TI has focused its product portfolio on differentiated products and supplemented its internal semiconductor manufacturing with supply from foundries.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable of $1.81 billion at the end of the fourth quarter decreased $103 million sequentially due to seasonally lower receivables in the company's Educational & Productivity Solutions segment. Accounts receivable increased $116 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 45 at the end of the fourth quarter compared with 48 at the end of the previous quarter and 48 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory of $1.27 billion at the end of the fourth quarter increased $115 million sequentially as the company built inventory from the lower-than-desired levels of the third quarter. For the year, inventory increased by $17 million compared with the end of 2004. The increases for both the quarter and the year were primarily in work-in-process, with fourth-quarter finished goods still remaining below desired levels. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 62 compared with 57 at the end of the previous quarter and 62 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on March 6, 2006, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
The previously announced divestiture of the Sensors & Controls operations is expected to close in the first half of 2006. The financial results of this business will be accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the first quarter of 2006.
 
For the first quarter of 2006, TI expects revenue from continuing operations to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.33. This estimate includes about $0.04, or about $90 million, for stock-based compensation expense. Earnings per share in the first quarter will be negatively impacted by about $0.03 due to a higher expected tax rate when compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings per share from discontinued operations are expected to be about $0.03.
 
In 2006 for continuing operations, the estimated annual effective tax rate is about 30 percent, which is based on current tax law and does not assume reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which expired at the end of 2005.
 
Also in 2006 for continuing operations, TI expects R&D expense of about $2.2 billion and capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion. Depreciation is expected to be about $1.03 billion and reflects the company's change to a straight-line calculation. Depreciation under the company's prior accelerated method would have been about $1.21 billion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Profit from operations includes, in millions of dollars, stock-based compensation expense of $86, $82 and $4 for the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2004, and $178 and $18 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
 
Semiconductor
 
 
 
 
 
demand for high-performance analog products, which more than offset the loss of revenue from the company's commodity liquid crystal display (LCD) driver product line that was divested in the first quarter of 2005. In 2005, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from analog.

Exhibit 99
 
 
  
Revenue Grows 23% from Year Ago
  
Gross Profit Margin Increases to 50.1 Percent of Revenue
  
Company Earns $0.33 Per Share from Continuing Operations, Up 57% from Year Ago
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. TIs Sensors & Controls business is reported as a discontinued operation. The previously announced divestiture of this business is expected to close in the second quarter of 2006.
 
DALLAS (April 18, 2006) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported first-quarter 2006 revenue of $3.33 billion, up 23 percent from the same quarter in 2005 as growth in the companys Semiconductor segment accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue in the first quarter, usually the companys seasonally weakest quarter, was about even with the fourth quarter of 2005.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.33, up 57 percent from a year ago, and included stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. The company began expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005 and, therefore, equivalent stock-based compensation expense was not reflected in the year-ago period when the company earned $0.21 per share from continuing operations.
This is a good start to the year. Demand was strong, and we expect it to continue, said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. Especially encouraging was our growth in digital signal processors and analog semiconductors, increasing 32 percent and 24 percent respectively from a year ago. These are the core semiconductors of todays electronics, including 3G cell phones where our revenue doubled from a year ago; low-end cell phones that are beginning to gain traction in large, emerging markets; and wireless basestations where our revenue grew by more than half. We also built momentum in consumer awareness for high-definition televisions that use TIs DLP
picture technology.
 
Gross Profit
TIs gross profit was $1.67 billion, or 50.1 percent of revenue, an increase of $15 million from the fourth quarter. Gross profit increased $428 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Stock-based compensation expense of $18 million was included in cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense of $533 million, or 16.0 percent of revenue, increased $40 million sequentially due to a combination of increased semiconductor product development, especially for wireless and high-performance analog products, and seasonally higher pay and benefits. R&D expense increased $46 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to stock-based compensation expense of $28 million, which was included in the first quarter of 2006, as well as higher semiconductor product development. R&D in the first quarter included expenses associated with TIs acquisition of Chipcon Group ASA, a leader in the design of short-range, low-power wireless RF (radio frequency) transceiver semiconductors. The acquisition will help expand TIs high-performance analog product portfolio.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $421 million, or 12.6 percent of revenue, increased $17 million sequentially primarily due to seasonally higher pay and benefits. SG&A increased $100 million from a year ago primarily due to the combination of stock-based compensation expense of $45 million included in the first quarter of 2006 and higher Semiconductor marketing expense, which included consumer advertising for DLP products.
Operating Profit
Operating profit of $718 million, or 21.5 percent of revenue, declined $42 million sequentially primarily due to higher operating expenses in the Semiconductor segment. Operating profit increased $282 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit in the Semiconductor segment. Total stock-based compensation expense of $91 million, or 2.7 percent of revenue, was included in corporate activities in the first quarter.
Net Income
 
Income from continuing operations was $542 million or $0.33 per share, which includes $0.04 of stock-based compensation expense. Income from discontinued operations was $43 million. Net income was $585 million or $0.36 per share.
Orders
TI orders of $3.60 billion increased $116 million sequentially due to seasonally higher orders in the Educational & Productivity Solutions business in preparation for the back-to-school retail season. TI orders increased $859 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand for Semiconductor products.
Cash
Cash flow from operations of $522 million decreased $358 million sequentially and increased $24 million from the year-ago quarter.
At the end of the first quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $3.66 billion, down $1.67 billion from the end of the previous quarter and $1.47 billion from the end of the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company repurchased 47 million shares of TI common stock for $1.44 billion, paid $48 million in dividends and retired $311 million of long-term debt. The company also acquired Chipcon in the first quarter for $177 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
Capital expenditures of $408 million increased $74 million sequentially and increased $141 million from the year-ago
quarter.
 
TIs capital expenditures in the first quarter were primarily for assembly, test and advanced 65- and 45-nanometer wafer fabrication equipment used to manufacture semiconductors.
Depreciation of $270 million decreased $66 million sequentially and $71 million from a year ago. The companys change from an accelerated to a straight-line method of depreciation beginning in the first quarter of 2006 lowered first-quarter depreciation by $29 million.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
Accounts receivable of $1.80 billion increased $150 million sequentially due to higher Semiconductor shipments in the last month of the quarter versus the comparable period in the prior quarter. Accounts receivable increased $274 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 49 at the end of the first quarter compared with 45 at the end of the previous quarter and 51 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Inventory of $1.25 billion at the end of the first quarter increased $61 million sequentially as the company built inventory from the lower-than-desired levels of the fourth quarter in order to better support customer demand. Inventory increased $90 million compared with the year-ago level. Days of inventory at the end of the first quarter were 67 compared with 64 at the end of the previous quarter and 71 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Outlook
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on
June 8, 2006, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the companys web site.
For the second quarter of 2006, TI expects revenue from continuing operations to be in the following ranges:
 
TI expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.43. This estimate includes about $0.04, or about $90 million, for stock-based compensation expense.
In 2006 for continuing operations, the estimated annual effective tax rate remains about 30 percent.  This rate is based on current tax law and does not assume reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which expired at the end of 2005.
Also in 2006 for continuing operations, TI still expects R&D expense of about $2.2 billion and capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion. Depreciation is still expected to be about $1.03 billion.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
 
DALLAS (July 24, 2006) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported revenue of $3.70 billion for the second quarter of 2006. Revenue was 11 percent higher sequentially and 24 percent higher than the same quarter a year ago as demand for the companys semiconductors continued to strengthen. Sequential growth also benefited from seasonal demand for graphing calculators as retailers began to stock for the upcoming back-to-school season. As previously announced, the company received a $70 million royalty settlement in the quarter that was included in revenue.
 
 
  
   
Earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.47, up 42 percent sequentially and 34 percent from a year ago. EPS included an expense of $0.03 from stock-based compensation, a benefit of $0.03 from a sales tax refund and a benefit of $0.02 from the royalty settlement. The company began expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005 and, therefore, equivalent stock-based compensation expense was not reflected in the year-ago quarter, when the company earned $0.35 per share from continuing operations.
 
This was another excellent quarter for Texas Instruments, said Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer. All regions of the world showed strong revenue growth from a year ago. Revenue from our wireless semiconductors grew 27 percent, including more than 70 percent growth in 3G; revenue from high-performance analog semiconductors grew 32 percent; and revenue from our DLP
picture technology grew 34 percent.
 
Strategically, our focus on open wireless standards was reinforced by the actions of operators around the world, who are accelerating their infrastructure transitions to GSM because of its cost effectiveness and the wide range of choices it offers, Templeton said.
 
Going into the third quarter, our backlog of orders is up, and our outlook is for seasonal growth. As always, we will pay close attention to the worlds economies and to our inventory in the various market channels.
Gross Profit
 
TIs gross profit was $1.91 billion, or 51.6 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $235 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $481 million from the year-ago quarter. The increases over both periods reflect higher revenue in the companys two segments, Semiconductor and Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS).
Operating Expenses
 
 
Research and development (R&D) expense was $536 million, or 14.5 percent of revenue. R&D increased $3 million from the prior quarter and $51 million from the year-ago quarter. The increases were due to higher spending for development of new semiconductor devices, particularly associated with wireless applications.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $418 million, or 11.3 percent of revenue. This expense decreased $3 million from the prior quarter and was up $79 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase from a year ago was primarily due to the combination of stock-based compensation expense and higher spending for consumer advertising of the companys DLP semiconductors used in high-definition televisions.
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit was $953 million, or 25.8 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $235 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher gross profit in both of the companys segments. It was also an increase of $351 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit in the Semiconductor segment. Total stock-based compensation expense of $84 million, or 2.3 percent of revenue, was included in Corporate in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
 
   
OI&E of $88 million increased $36 million from the prior quarter and $32 million from the year-ago quarter due to a sales tax refund and higher interest income.
 
Net Income
 
Income from continuing operations was $739 million, or $0.47 per share. 
 
Net income, which includes income from continuing and discontinued operations, was $2.39 billion, or $1.50 per share. This included $1.65 billion from discontinued operations, almost all of which was a gain on the sale of the companys former Sensors & Controls business.
Orders
 
TI orders were $3.91 billion. This was an increase of $302 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $767 million from the year-ago quarter. Both increases were primarily due to higher demand for the companys semiconductor products.
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations was $667 million. This was an increase of $145 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $97 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
At the end of the second quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $5.67 billion, up $2.01 billion from the end of the prior quarter and up $1.20 billion from the end of the year-ago quarter. These increases were primarily due to the $2.98 billion of cash from the sale of the companys Sensors & Controls business as well as income from continuing operations, partially offset by the cash used for stock repurchases. During the second quarter of 2006, the company repurchased 33 million shares of TI common stock for $1.04 billion and paid $47 million in dividends. Also in the quarter, $275 million of variable-rate bank notes were prepaid.
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures were $374 million. This was a decrease of $34 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $127 million from the year-ago
quarter.
 
TIs capital expenditures in the second quarter were primarily for equipment used in the assembly and test of semiconductors.
 
Depreciation was $267 million, a decrease of $3 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $70 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable were $1.93 billion. This was an increase of $131 million from the prior quarter due to seasonally higher receivables for calculators in the E&PS segment, and an
increase of $191 million from the year-ago quarter reflecting higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 47 at the end of the second quarter compared with 49 at the end of the prior quarter and 53 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory was $1.34 billion at the end of the second quarter. This was an increase of $89 million from the prior quarter as the company built inventory to support expected product shipments in the second half of the year. Compared with the year-ago quarter, inventory increased $219 million. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter were 67 compared with 67 at the end of the prior quarter and 65 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on
September 11, 2006, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the companys web site.
 
For the third quarter of 2006, TI expects revenue from continuing operations to be in the following ranges:
TI expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.48.
 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations in 2006 is expected to be about 30 percent, unchanged from the prior estimate.  This tax rate is based on current tax law and does not assume reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which expired at the end of 2005.
Additionally in 2006 for continuing operations, TI still expects expense for R&D to be about $2.2 billion and capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion. Depreciation is expected to be about $1.05 billion, up slightly from the prior estimate.
 
Certain amounts in the prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
 
* Semiconductor profit from operations includes a benefit of $57 for a state sales tax refund and $60 from the royalty settlement in the second quarter of 2006.
** Corporate includes stock-based compensation expense of $84, $91 and $5 respectively.
 
The royalty settlement and sales tax refund benefit included in TI's second quarter 2006 results are detailed as follows. All items are in the Semiconductor segment results except the $20 million in Other income (expense) net, which is in Corporate.

Exhibit 99
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
DALLAS (October 23, 2006) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported third-quarter 2006 revenue of $3.76 billion. Revenue grew 2 percent compared with the second quarter, which included a $70 million royalty settlement, and increased 13 percent from the same quarter a year ago. The increases were primarily due to continued strong demand for the companys high-performance analog and DSP products.
Earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.45. Second-quarter EPS of $0.47 included a benefit of $0.03 from a sales tax refund and a benefit of $0.02 from a royalty settlement. EPS grew 25 percent from $0.36 in the year-ago quarter. EPS in each of these periods included an expense of $0.03 for stock-based compensation.
The third quarter was one of the best in TIs history, said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer. Our revenue once again set an all-time record as our share continued to climb in our core markets. Our strong gross and operating margins reflected the value of our product portfolio, rich in analog and DSP products.
At the same time, orders declined, leading us to expect that fourth-quarter Semiconductor growth will be below the seasonal average. A couple of factors are influencing this. First, we believe customers have broadly replenished their own inventory and are confident in operating with lower backlog now that chip supply has improved. The second factor is wireless, where we expect that unit mix will be more weighted toward low-priced cell phones and inventory correction will continue in Japan. Even with a less-than-seasonal fourth quarter, we expect the growth rate of our Semiconductor business to be in the upper teens for the year, Templeton said.
In the near term, we are managing inventory and tightening expenses. We have a responsive manufacturing model and we believe distributor inventory levels remain lean, both of which should serve us well. We are competing from a position of strength with leading products and with customers who are gaining share.
Gross Profit
 
TIs gross profit was $1.93 billion, or 51.4 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $25 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $242 million from the year-ago quarter. The increases were due to higher revenue in the companys Semiconductor segment.
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense was $570 million, or 15.2 percent of revenue. R&D expense was $34 million higher than the prior quarter primarily because the second quarter included a sales tax refund. R&D expense increased $49 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher investment in new semiconductor technology, particularly for wireless applications.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $432 million, or 11.5 percent of revenue. SG&A expense increased $14 million from the prior quarter. This expense was $24 million higher than a year ago primarily because of increased consumer advertising of DLP
technology for high-definition televisions.
Operating Profit
Operating profit was $930 million, or 24.7 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $23 million from the prior quarter, which included a $117 million operating profit benefit associated with a royalty settlement and a sales tax refund. Operating profit increased $169 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit in the Semiconductor segment.
Total stock-based compensation expense of $79 million, or 2.1 percent of revenue, was included in Corporate in the third quarter. This was about the same as in the comparison periods.
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
OI&E of $55 million decreased $33 million from the prior quarter, which included a $20 million benefit from a sales tax refund. OI&E increased $6 million from the year-ago quarter.
Net Income
Income from continuing operations was $686 million, or $0.45 per share.
Net income of $702 million includes income from continuing and discontinued operations. In the prior quarter, net income included $1.65 billion from discontinued operations, almost all of which was a gain on the sale of the companys former Sensors & Controls business.
 
Orders
TI orders were $3.43 billion. This was a decrease of $478 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $41 million from the year-ago quarter. The decreases were due to lower orders in the companys Semiconductor segment.
Cash
Cash flow from operations was $419 million. This was a decline of $248 million from the prior quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $4.18 billion, down $1.49 billion from the end of the prior quarter. During the third quarter, the company used $1.69 billion to repurchase 56 million shares and paid $46 million in dividends. During the past four quarters, the company used $5.04 billion to repurchase 163 million shares, reducing shares outstanding by more than 8 percent.
Capital Spending and Depreciation
Capital expenditures were $276 million. This was a decrease of $98 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $164 million from the year-ago
quarter.
 
TIs capital expenditures in the third quarter were primarily for equipment used in the assembly and test of semiconductors.
Depreciation was $266 million, about the same as the prior quarter. Depreciation decreased $66 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
Accounts receivable were $2.09 billion. This was an increase of $160 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher revenue in the month of September versus the month of June. Accounts receivable increased $333 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher revenue.
Days sales outstanding were 50 at the end of the third quarter compared with 47 at the end of the prior and the year-ago quarters.
Inventory of $1.49 billion at the end of the third quarter was above desired levels. This was an increase of $156 million from the prior quarter as the company built inventory to support expected product shipments, especially for cell phones. To a lesser degree, the company also began to rebuild needed work-in-process inventory that previously had been depleted for catalog product lines such as high-performance analog. Compared with the year-ago quarter, when inventory was below desired levels, inventory increased $417 million. Days of inventory at the end of the third quarter were 73 compared with 67 at the end of the prior quarter and 59 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Outlook
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on
December 11, 2006, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the companys web site.
For the fourth quarter of 2006, TI expects revenue from continuing operations to be in the following ranges:
TI expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.46.
In 2006 for continuing operations, TI expects: the annual effective tax rate to be about 29 percent compared with its prior expectation of about 30 percent;
expense for R&D to be about $2.2 billion; capital expenditures to be about $1.3 billion; and depreciation to be about $1.05 billion.
 
 
* Semiconductor includes a benefit of $57 for a state sales tax refund and $60 from the royalty settlement in the second quarter of 2006.
The royalty settlement and sales tax refund benefit included in TI's second-quarter 2006 results are detailed as follows. All items are in the Semiconductor segment results except the $20 million in Other income (expense) net, which is in Corporate.

Notes to Financial Statements
1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Practices
: Texas Instruments (TI) makes, markets and sells high-technology components; more than 50,000 customers all over the world buy TI products. We have two reportable operating business segments: Semiconductor and Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS). Semiconductor accounted for 96 percent of revenue in 2005 and over time averages a higher growth rate than E&PS, although the semiconductor market is characterized by wide swings in growth rates from year to year. The former Sensors & Controls business has been reflected as discontinued operations (see Note 2). Additionally, the radio frequency identification (RFID) systems operations that had been part of the Sensors & Controls business segment are included in the Semiconductor business segment.
Business
In December 2005, we announced an agreement to acquire Chipcon Group ASA (Chipcon), a leading company in the design of short-range, low-power wireless radio frequency (RF) transceiver devices, based in Oslo, Norway. The acquisition will enhance TI's ability to offer customers complete short-range wireless solutions for consumer, home and building automation applications. We agreed to pay approximately $200 million in cash for Chipcon. The transaction closed in January 2006. Accordingly, Chipcon's results of operations are not recorded in the financial statements as of December 31, 2005.
In July 2003, we acquired 100 percent of the equity of Radia Communications, Inc. (Radia) for a purchase price of approximately $133 million. The acquisition was made to further TI's development and product offerings in RF semiconductor, subsystem, signal processing and networking technologies for 802.11 wireless local area networking multi-band/multi-mode radios and was integrated into the Semiconductor business segment.
These acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations, and the results of operations of these businesses are included in the consolidated statements of income from their dates of acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented as it would not be materially different from amounts reported.
: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and, except for the presentation of the former Sensors & Controls business as discontinued operations, the restatement of the Semiconductor business segment to include the RFID systems operations and the early adoption of a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation (as discussed below in , on the same basis as the audited financial statements included in the 2004 annual report. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in the notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. All amounts in the notes reference continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
Basis of Presentation
Effects of Stock-based Compensation)
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.
: For financial reporting purposes, the functional currency for non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than U.S. dollars are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at year end. Inventories and property, plant and equipment and depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Net currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are charged or credited on a current basis to other income (expense) net.
Foreign Currency
: We use derivative financial instruments to minimize exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. We enter into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not meet hedge accounting criteria. These instruments are primarily forward currency exchange contracts that are intended as economic hedges to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from forward currency exchange contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures from remeasurement are credited or charged on a current basis to other income (expense) net.
Derivatives
Gains and losses from other forward currency exchange contracts intended to hedge specific transactions and from terminated forward currency exchange contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the related transactions.
With respect to long-term debt and its associated interest expense, we seek to maintain a mix of both fixed and variable interest rates that, over time, is expected to moderate financing costs. In order to achieve this goal, we utilize interest rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges to change the characteristics of the interest rate stream on the debt from fixed rates to short-term variable rates. Gains and losses from interest rate swaps are included on the accrual basis in interest expense. There is no hedge ineffectiveness related to these swaps. Gains and losses from terminated interest rate swaps are deferred and recognized consistent with the terms of the underlying transaction.
We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
: Revenue from sales of our products, including shipping fees, is recognized when title to the products is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Estimates of returns for product quality reasons and of price allowances (calculated based upon historical experience, analysis of product shipments and contractual arrangements with customers), are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances include discounts for prompt payment, as well as volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. In addition, allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from sales to distributors of our products is recognized, net of allowances, based upon delivery of product to the distributors. At the time of delivery, title transfers to the distributors and payment from the distributors is due on our standard commercial terms; payment terms are not contingent upon resale of the product. Credit allowances for the distributors are calculated based on historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. For instance, we sell our products to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant price adjustment credits to distributors in response to individual competitive opportunities they may have. To estimate allowances for this type of credit, we use statistical percentages of revenue, determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends. We also provide distributors an allowance, to scrap certain slow-moving or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of purchases from each distributor. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still in distributor on-hand inventory, we may credit the distributors for the difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to estimated distributor on-hand inventory of that product. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for these credits in a timely manner.
Royalty revenue is recognized upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as estimated by us, and when realization is considered probable by management.
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue.
: Advertising and other promotional costs are expensed as incurred. This expense was $126 million in 2005, $92 million in 2004 and $79 million in 2003.
Advertising Costs
: Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of fixed assets, intangible assets or capitalized software licenses are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.
Impairments of Long-lived Assets
: We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. When it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
Income Taxes
: Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share from continuing operations, on a basic and diluted basis, are as follows (shares in millions):
Earnings per Share (EPS)
 
The EPS computations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 exclude 82 million, 113 million and 116 million shares, respectively, for stock options because their effect would have been antidilutive.
: We have several stock-based employee compensation plans that are more fully described in Note 14. Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for awards granted under those plans following the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and related interpretations. No compensation cost was reflected in net income for stock options, as all options granted under the plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant (except options granted under employee stock purchase plans and acquisition-related stock option awards). Compensation cost has previously been recognized for restricted stock units (RSUs).
Effects of Stock-based Compensation
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), , using the modified prospective application method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes the applicable amounts of: (a) compensation cost of all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, July 1, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and previously presented in pro forma footnote disclosures), and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)). Results for prior periods have not been restated.
"Share-Based Payments
"
Effect of Adopting SFAS No. 123(R):
The amounts below include the impact of recognizing compensation expense related to nonqualified stock options and stock options offered under employee stock purchase plans. Compensation expense related to RSUs was already being recognized before implementation of SFAS No. 123(R), so that component of total stock-based compensation expense is not included in the table below. Compensation expense for RSUs totaled $18 million for the year 2005, $18 million for 2004 and $15 million for 2003, and is included in SG&A. Total stock-based compensation expense, which includes both expense from stock options and RSUs, totaled $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
The following is the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) as of July 1, 2005:
 
Stock-based compensation expense has not been allocated to our segments, but is reflected in corporate.
Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123(R), we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options as operating cash flows (reflected in income taxes payable). SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax deductions realized in excess of the compensation costs recognized for the options exercised) to be classified as cash flows provided by financing activities. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), excess tax benefits of $59 million from July 1, 2005, have been classified as cash flows provided by financing activities.
Prior Period Pro Forma Presentations:
Under the modified prospective application method, results for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the effects of implementing SFAS No. 123(R). The following pro forma information, as required by SFAS No. 148, is presented for comparative purposes and illustrates the pro forma effect on income from continuing operations and earnings per common
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,"
share from continuing operations for each period presented as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation prior to July 1, 2005:
 
In the first quarter of 2005, we reduced the attribution period used for certain grants of nonqualified stock options to recognize fair value-based compensation expense for pro forma disclosure purposes for those stock option recipients who are retirement eligible or become retirement eligible prior to vesting of the awards. Our nonqualified stock options have 10-year terms and generally vest over a four-year service period from the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2005, stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees is now recognized over a six-month required service period, and for non-retirement-eligible employees, over the shorter of the period from the grant date to the date they become retirement eligible (but not less than the six-month required service period) or the normal four-year vesting period. As a result, we included in our first-quarter 2005 pro forma footnote disclosures a $93 million ($0.05 per share) inception-to-date adjustment of fair value-based compensation expense for both retirement-eligible employees and employees who become retirement eligible prior to vesting of the awards, to reflect the reduced attribution period.
Assumptions:
The fair values for these awards were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the weighted-average assumptions listed below. Because options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected, the effects of these hypothetical calculations on the financial statements are not likely to be representative of similar future calculations.
 
Effective July 1, 2005, we changed our assumption of determining expected volatility on all new options granted after that date to rely solely on available implied volatility rates rather than an analysis of historical volatility. After giving consideration to recently available regulatory guidance, we believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. The effect of this change on income before taxes, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005, was not material.
Expected lives of options are determined based on the historical share option exercise experience of our optionees, using a rolling 10-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available.
Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options.
Expected dividend yields are based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and the current market price of TI common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change has been included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term.
: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis. Prior to January 1, 2006, standard costs were based on the optimal utilization of installed factory capacity. With the adoption of SFAS No. 151, effective January 1, 2006, standard costs will be based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity, which is not materially different from the optimal rates previously used (see below). Costs associated with underutilization of capacity are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
"Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,"
Change in Accounting Standards
We conduct quarterly inventory reviews for salability and obsolescence. A specific allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. Remaining inventory has a salability and obsolescence allowance based upon the historical disposal percentage. Inventory is written off in the period in which disposal occurs.
: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and prior to January 1, 2006, were depreciated primarily on the 150 percent declining-balance method over their estimated useful lives. Fully depreciated assets are written off against accumulated depreciation. Acquisition-related costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Capitalized Costs
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
: Effective January 1, 2006, as a result of a study made of the pattern of usage of our long-lived depreciable assets, we will adopt the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment. Under the new provisions of SFAS No. 154, "," which become effective as of January 1, 2006, a change in depreciation method is treated as a change in estimate. The effect of the change in depreciation method will be reflected on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006, and prior period results will not be restated. As the results of our study indicated that the current estimated useful lives of our assets were appropriate, the depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment assets will not be changed. We believe that the change from the 150 percent declining-balance depreciation method to the straight-line method will better reflect the pattern of consumption of the future benefits to be derived from those assets being depreciated and will provide a better matching of costs and revenues over the assets' estimated useful lives.
Change in Depreciation Method
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3
: All investments in equity and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale except for investments in certain mutual funds (described below) that are held to offset deferred compensation liabilities. Equity investments held at December 31, 2005 and 2004, include publicly traded marketable securities and private investments, which are generally non-marketable. Investments in marketable equity and debt securities are stated at fair value, which is based on market quotes where available or estimates by investment advisors or management, as appropriate. Adjustments to fair value of these investments are recorded as an increase or decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income section of stockholders' equity except where losses are considered to be other than temporary, in which case the losses are recorded as expenses in other income (expense) net. Marketable securities are considered other-than-temporarily impaired if they have traded below cost basis for more than six months.
Investments
Investments in non-marketable equity securities, primarily comprised of investments in early stage development companies and various venture capital funds, are stated at historical cost and are subject to a periodic impairment review. Any impairment considered other than temporary is recorded in other income (expense) net. Cost or amortized cost, as appropriate, is determined on a specific identification basis.
Investments in certain mutual funds are classified as trading and are stated at fair value. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments and are intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements, thus are classified as a long-term investment. Adjustments to fair value of both the mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in SG&A expense (see Note 15 for a discussion of ).
Deferred Compensation Arrangements
: Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain indicators arise. We complete our annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1 of each year for all our business segments, which have been designated as reporting units based on an analysis of economic characteristics and how we operate the business. This annual test is performed by comparing the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. For each of the periods presented, the fair value exceeded the carrying value including goodwill, therefore no impairment was indicated.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives. Fully amortized intangible assets are written off against accumulated amortization.
: In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, which will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in inventory. In addition, this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We have completed the evaluation of the impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations, and have concluded that the impact of the change will not be material, as the normal capacity rate to be used is not materially different from the optimal capacity rate that we previously used.
Changes in Accounting Standards
"Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,"
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "." This standard provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections and will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. This standard applies to voluntary changes in existing accounting principles and to new accounting standards that do not specify the transition requirements upon adoption of those standards. Except for changes in depreciation methods, this standard will require retrospective application of the new accounting principle to previous periods reported rather than presenting the cumulative effect of the change as of the beginning of the period of the change. Changes in depreciation methods will be applied on a prospective basis, meaning the effects of the change will be reflected only in current and future periods. Corrections of errors will be reported by restating previously issued financial statements. As mentioned above, we will change our method of depreciation on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2006.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "," which is effective for us as of December 31, 2005. This interpretation provides additional guidance as to when companies should record the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when there is uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of the obligation. We have completed the evaluation of the impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations, and have determined that the impact of the change was not material.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, " (FSP 115-1 and 124-1), which address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 also include accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and require certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. These FSPs will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential impact these standards may have on our financial position and results of operations, but do not believe the impact will be material.
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,"
2. Discontinued Operations
On January 9, 2006, we announced a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the Sensors & Controls segment, excluding the RFID systems operations, to an affiliate of Bain Capital, LLC, for $3 billion in cash. The sale was completed on April 27, 2006. The former Sensors & Controls business acquired by Bain Capital, LLC was renamed Sensata Technologies (Sensata).
The results of operations of the former Sensors & Controls business are being presented as discontinued operations. The following summarizes results from the discontinued operations of the former Sensors & Controls business for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, included in the consolidated statements of income:
 
Earnings per share amounts from continuing and discontinued operations may not add to net income per share due to rounding.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, assets and liabilities of the Sensors & Controls business to be sold were summarized as follows:
 
In 2004, we completed a sale-leaseback of our facilities in Attleboro, Massachusetts, headquarters of the former Sensors & Controls business. The terms included a 20-year lease agreement for a new facility at the site to be used to consolidate the operations remaining there. In the fourth quarter of 2005, upon the completion of the new facility, we began to account for this as a capital lease, recording both the capital asset and lease obligation at a fair value of $31 million.
In 2003, we announced a plan to move certain production lines from Attleboro to other TI sites in order to be geographically closer to customers and their markets and to reduce manufacturing costs. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 911 employees have been terminated. Charges related to this action were $17 million, $13 million and $40 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
: Upon closing of the sales transaction, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with Sensata to provide various temporary support services that are reasonably necessary to facilitate the continuation of the normal conduct of business of the former Sensors & Controls business such as finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, warehousing and logistics, and records retention and storage. Such services are expected to be provided for approximately six to twelve months, although certain information technology-related services may be provided for up to two years. The fees for these services will be generally equivalent to our cost. In addition, we entered into certain cross-license agreements to allow each party to continue to use the associated technology and intellectual property in the conduct of their respective business. However, these cross-license agreements generally do not involve the receipt or payment of any royalties and therefore are not considered to be a component of continuing involvement.
Continuing Involvement
Although the services provided under the TSA generate continuing cash flows between us and Sensata, the amounts are not considered to be significant to the ongoing operations of either entity. In addition, we have no contractual ability through the TSA or any other agreement to significantly influence the operating or financial policies of Sensata. Under the provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-13, "," we therefore have no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the former Sensors & Controls business and have classified the historical results of that business as discontinued operations.
Applying the Conditions of Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations
3. Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
We generally invest cash in highly liquid debt securities that are classified as available for sale and are reflected in the balance sheet based on their maturity dates. Investments with serial maturities are allocated to their asset classification based on their individual expected average lives. Investments in debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in debt securities with remaining maturities or average lives beyond three months as being available for use in current operations as needed and, as a result, include those investments in short-term investments. All of these investments in debt securities are stated at fair value. We also invest in auction rate securities. These securities have long-term underlying maturities; however, the market is highly liquid and the securities are re-auctioned periodically, generally every seven, 28 or 35 days. Our intent is not to hold these securities to maturity, but rather to use the frequent auction feature to sell securities to provide liquidity as needed. Our practice is to invest in these securities for higher yields compared to those available on cash equivalents.
 
The following table presents the aggregate maturities or average lives of cash equivalents and short-term investments at year-end 2005:
 
Unrealized holding gains for these securities were zero at the end of 2005, and $1 million and $9 million at the end of 2004 and 2003. Unrealized holding losses for these securities were $25 million, $27 million and $18 million at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Proceeds from sales of these securities before their maturity were $4.18 billion, $1.95 billion and $3.03 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from the sales of these securities were immaterial for all periods presented.
4. Inventories
 
5. Property, Plant and Equipment at Cost
 
Authorizations for property, plant and equipment expenditures in future years were $611 million at December 31, 2005.
6. Equity and Debt Investments
Following is information on the investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004:
 
The investment in a convertible debt instrument was sold in 2005.
Proceeds from sales of equity and debt investments were $53 million in 2005, $32 million in 2004 and $778 million in 2003. There were $13 million, $12 million and $213 million of gross realized gains and $3 million, zero and zero of gross realized losses from sales of these investments in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of available-for-sale investments recognized in the income statement were $8 million, $13 million and $42 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
7. Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related Intangibles
 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain indicators arise. No impairment indicators arose during 2005, 2004 or 2003. The goodwill balances shown are net of total accumulated amortization of $221 million at year-end 2005 and 2004. No goodwill was acquired during the year. All of our goodwill is attributable to our Semiconductor segment.
The following table reflects the components of acquisition-related intangible assets, excluding goodwill, that are subject to amortization:
 
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and deferred compensation (including unearned compensation, a contra-stockholders' equity account) was $55 million, $69 million and $98 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily related to developed technology. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization.
The following table sets forth the estimated amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and deferred compensation (including unearned compensation, a contra-stockholders' equity account) for the years ended December 31:
 
8. Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities
 
9. Debt and Lines of Credit
 
In 1996, the coupon rates for the notes due 2006 were swapped for LIBOR-based variable rates through 2006, for an effective interest rate of approximately 3.61% and 1.52% as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. In 2001, the coupon rates for the notes due 2007 were swapped for LIBOR-based variable rates through 2007, for an effective interest rate of approximately 8.27% and 6.30% as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The effect of these interest rate swaps was to reduce interest expense by $11 million, $19 million and $20 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
In November 2005, in connection with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings under provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), our Japan subsidiary entered into a syndicated credit agreement with a consortium of banks to borrow $275 million at a LIBOR-based variable rate. A portion of this debt is due in 2008 and the remainder in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the borrowing, the Japan subsidiary entered into a revolving credit facility for $175 million that would also carry a variable rate of interest, if drawn. At December 31, 2005, the applicable interest rate on the $275 million term note was 4.64% and the revolving credit facility remained undrawn.
Interest incurred on loans in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $14 million, $24 million and $41 million. Of these amounts, $5 million in 2005, $3 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003 were capitalized as a component of capital asset construction costs.
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt due during the years subsequent to December 31, 2005, are as follows:
 
We also maintain lines of credit to support commercial paper borrowings and to provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. These lines of credit totaled $500 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, but were not utilized in either year.
10. Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration
: The carrying amounts and related estimated fair values of our significant financial instruments at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were:
Financial Instruments
 
We have other derivative financial instruments such as investment warrants and forward currency exchange contracts, the carrying value and fair values of which were not significant as of December 31, 2005 or 2004. We had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, with a face value of $191 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $67 million to sell euros, $41 million to sell Japanese yen and $17 million to buy Korean won). At December 31, 2004, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a face value of $270 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $139 million to buy euros, $28 million to buy Taiwan dollars and $28 million to sell Japanese yen).
Short-term investments are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.
: Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments, accounts receivable and equity investments. We place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
Risk Concentration
In order to minimize our exposure to credit risk, we limit counterparties on the forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to investment-grade-rated financial institutions.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain an allowance for losses based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable in the balance sheets. Details of these allowances are as follows:
 
11. Stockholders' Equity
We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. No preferred stock is currently outstanding.
Each outstanding share of TI common stock carries one-fourth of a stock purchase right. Under certain circumstances, each right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of TI participating cumulative preferred stock for $200. Under certain circumstances following the acquisition of 20 percent or more of outstanding TI common stock by an acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement), each right (other than rights held by an acquiring person) may be exercised to purchase the common stock of TI or a successor company with a market value of twice the $200 exercise price. The rights, which are redeemable by us at one cent per right, expire in June 2008.
Previously in 2004, 2003 and 2002, the TI board of directors approved the repurchases of up to 21 million, 18 million and 14 million shares of TI common stock under our stock repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2004, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of TI common stock in addition to the previous authorizations. During 2005, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of $4 billion of TI common stock in addition to the previous authorizations.
On January 23, 2006, the board of directors authorized repurchases of up to $5 billion of TI common stock. This authorization is in addition to previously announced stock repurchase authorizations.
No expiration date has been specified for these authorizations. Each authorization is to use existing cash.
Treasury shares acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 154,143,706 shares; 30,102,546 shares; and 13,877,932 shares.
In the third quarter of 2005, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend (to $0.03 per share from $0.025 per share) and declared a dividend at the new quarterly rate on October 20, 2005.
12. Research and Development
R&D expense totaled $1.99 billion in 2005, $1.95 billion in 2004 and $1.72 billion in 2003. Acquisition-related in-process R&D charges were zero in 2005 and 2004, but were $23 million in 2003. The 2003 charges were for R&D from the acquisition of Radia and were recorded in R&D expense. Values for acquisition-related in-process R&D were determined at the acquisition date based upon the appraised value of the related developmental projects.
13. Other Income (Expense) Net
 
Equity investment gains (losses), net in 2003 included investment gains of $203 million from the sale of Micron common stock.
Other includes lease income of approximately $20 million per year, primarily from the purchaser of our former defense electronics business divested in 1997. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate amount of non-cancelable future lease payments to be received from these leases is $54 million. These leases contain renewal options.
Other also includes miscellaneous non-operational items such as gains and losses related to previously divested businesses, interest income and expense related to non-investment items such as taxes, and gains and losses from currency exchange rate changes. The 2004 amount includes income recognized from the partial settlement of matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding TI's former memory business operations, as well as a gain from a settlement with the State of Texas over claims for refund of state sales taxes relating to our previously divested defense electronics business.
14. Stock-based Compensation
Information in this note is inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, except as noted.
Long-term Incentive and Director Compensation Plans
We have stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas Instruments 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Texas Instruments 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Options are also outstanding under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Texas Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan, but no further options may be granted under these plans. We also assumed stock options granted under the Burr-Brown 1993 Stock Incentive Plan and the Radia Communications, Inc. 2000 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. Unless the options are acquisition-related replacement options, the option price per share
may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant. Substantially all the options have a 10-year term. Except for options granted as part of a special retention grant in February 2003 (which vest beginning in the second year after grant at a rate of 50%/25%/25% per year), options granted subsequent to 1996 generally vest ratably over four years. Options generally provide for the continuation of vesting after the option recipient retires.
We have RSUs outstanding under the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. Upon vesting, the shares are subject to issuance without payment by the grantee.
Under the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, we may grant stock options, including incentive stock options, restricted stock and RSUs, performance units and other stock-based awards. The plan provides for the issuance of 120,000,000 shares of TI common stock. In addition, if any stock-based award under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan or the Texas Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan terminates, then any unissued shares subject to the terminated award become available for granting awards under the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. No more than 13,400,000 shares of common stock may be awarded as restricted stock, RSUs or other stock-based awards under the plan.
Under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, we may grant stock options (other than incentive stock options), restricted stock and RSUs, performance units and other stock-based awards to non-management employees. The plan provides for the issuance of 240,000,000 shares of TI common stock. Executive officers and approximately 250 managers are ineligible to receive awards under this plan.
Under the Texas Instruments Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors adopted in April 1998, we granted stock options to each non-employee director once per year, in the period beginning January 1999 and extending through January 2003. Each grant under the plan was an option to purchase 5,000 shares (10,000 shares beginning January 2001) with an option price equal to fair market value on the date of grant. In April 2003, the plan, together with the Texas Instruments Restricted Stock Unit Plan for Directors and the Texas Instruments Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, was replaced by the Texas Instruments 2003 Director Compensation Plan. Under this plan approved by stockholders in April 2003, we may grant stock options, RSUs and other stock-based awards to non-employee directors, as well as issue TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred-compensation accounts established for such directors. The plan provides for the grant of a stock option to each non-employee director once per year in the period from January 2004 through 2010. Each grant is an option to purchase 15,000 shares with an option price equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Under the plan, we also make a one-time grant of 2,000 RSUs to each new non-employee director of TI. The plan provides for the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of TI common stock.
Stock option and RSU transactions under the above mentioned long-term incentive and director compensation plans during 2005 were as follows:
 
As of July 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and began recording compensation expense related to stock options measured at their fair value as of the grant date (see Note 1 for a discussion of ). Prior to that date, we recorded no compensation expense for non-acquisition-related stock option awards but did recognize compensation expense related to awards of RSUs. The fair values of RSUs are determined based on the average trading price of TI common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with RSUs, which was all in continuing operations, totaled $18 million, $18 million and $15 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Effects of Stock-based Compensation
The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $10.07, $15.61 and $8.13 per share, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $24.42, $31.20 and $17.33 per share, respectively.
Summarized information about stock options outstanding under the various long-term plans mentioned above at December 31, 2005, is as follows:
 
As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate intrinsic value (i.e., the difference in market price of $32.15 and the exercise price to be paid by the optionee) of stock options outstanding, excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, was $1.94 billion. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable stock options at that date was $1.28 billion.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e., the difference in the market price at the exercise date and the price paid by the employee to exercise the option) under these plans was $394 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the total fair value of shares vested from RSU grants was $24 million.
Summarized information about outstanding stock options that are already fully vested and those that are expected to vest in the future, as well as stock options that are fully vested and currently exercisable, are as follows:
 
As of December 31, 2005, the total future compensation cost for continuing operations related to non-vested stock options and RSUs not yet recognized in the statement of income was $435 million and $41 million, with weighted-average periods over which these awards are expected to be recognized of 1.1 years and 1.4 years, respectively. Of that total, $246 million, $163 million, $61 million and $6 million will be recognized in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plans
We had no stock options outstanding under the TI Employees 2002 Stock Purchase Plan (the 2002 Plan) at the end of 2005. Under this plan, options were offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee's compensation. The option price per share was 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant or on the exercise date, whichever was lower.
In April 2005, stockholders approved the TI Employees 2005 Stock Purchase Plan (the 2005 Plan), which replaced the 2002 Plan. Under the 2005 Plan, options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee's compensation. Under the 2005 Plan, the option price per share is 85 percent of the fair market value on the exercise date. Additionally, terms of the options under the 2005 Plan are three months, rather than six months under the predecessor plan.
The stock options outstanding under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2005, had an exercise price of $27.82 per share (85 percent of the fair market value of TI common stock on January 3, 2006, the date of automatic exercise). Of the total outstanding options, none were exercisable at year-end 2005.
Employee stock purchase plan transactions during 2005 were as follows:
 
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was $59 million.
Effect on Shares Outstanding and Treasury Shares
Stock option plan exercises include previously unissued shares of 53,855; 416,961 and 113,939 for 2005, 2004 and 2003. They also include treasury shares of 31,997,416; 15,488,357 and 18,258,205 for 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Previously unissued common shares issued for RSUs in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 570,042 shares, 402,009 shares and 108,619 shares. No treasury shares were issued upon vesting of RSUs in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Shares available for future grant and reserved for issuance are summarized below:
 
Effect on Cash Flows
The total amount of cash received from exercise of options was $461 million (which includes $119 million from TI Employees 2002 and 2005 Stock Purchase Plans) and the related net tax benefit realized from the exercise of those stock options was $132 million (which includes $59 million of excess tax benefits realized since July 1, 2005).
Related Policies
We issue awards of stock options generally with graded vesting provisions (e.g., 25 percent per year for four years). In such cases, we recognize the related compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the award.
For awards to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period required to be performed by the employee in order to earn the award.
It has been our practice to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options generally from treasury shares and from previously unissued shares on a limited basis.
15. Post-employment Benefit Plans
We provide various retirement plans for employees including defined benefit, defined contribution and retiree health care benefit plans, as well as deferred compensation arrangements for qualifying employees.
U.S. Retirement Plans
The principal retirement plans in the U.S include a qualified defined benefit pension plan (which is closed to new participants hired after November 1997), a defined contribution plan and an enhanced defined contribution plan. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pre-tax contributions to various investment choices, including a TI common stock fund. Employees who remain in the qualified defined benefit pension plan may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to remain in the defined benefit pension plan, and new employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 4 percent of the employee's annual eligible earnings.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, in accordance with the election of employees, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 53 million shares and 61 million shares valued at $1.70 billion and $1.51 billion. Dividends paid on these shares for 2005 and 2004 totaled $6 million in each year.
Our aggregate expense for U.S. employees under the defined contribution plans was $53 million in 2005 and 2004 and $48 million in 2003.
The benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of federal laws and regulations plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. During 2005, no contributions were made to the qualified defined benefit plan. We also sponsor a number of small defined benefit plans including a nonqualified plan. These plans are closed to new participants and are unfunded.
U.S. Retiree Health Care Benefit Plan
We offer access to group medical coverage during retirement to most of our U.S. employees. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon varying factors, the most important of which are an employee's date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the participants in the plan. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement.
Non-U.S. Retirement Plans
Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee's years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and subject to local country practices and market circumstances. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we contributed approximately $210 million into a qualified contractual trust arrangement in Germany. The contribution was enough to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation of the primary Germany defined benefit plan at September 30, 2005. There are significantly smaller defined benefit plans in Germany, which remain unfunded.
A substantial majority of the non-U.S. pension obligations and assets are associated with the defined benefit plan in Japan. During the latter part of 2004, a retirement plan change was approved by the employees in Japan and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. This change, implemented in 2005, resulted in a $64 million reduction in the projected benefit obligation.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, in accordance with the election of employees, TI's non-U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 0.7 million shares and 0.9 million shares valued at $22 million and $21 million. Dividends paid on these shares for 2005 and 2004 totaled $70 thousand and $105 thousand.
Effect on the Statements of Income and Balance Sheets
Net periodic benefit cost of the defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans was as follows:
 
For the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit expense is based upon the market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets utilizes a smoothing technique whereby investment gains and losses that differ from plan assumptions are phased into the value over a period of three years.
The measurement date for the U.S. plans is December 31. The measurement date for the non-U.S. plans is September 30. Obligation and asset data for the defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans were as follows:
 
The 2005 adjustments from the September 30 measurement date to the December 31 reporting date include the approximate $210 million contribution to the Germany defined benefit pension plan, which was previously unfunded.
Also during 2005, the retirement plan in Japan experienced significantly better-than-expected investment returns. These returns, plus additional company contributions to other plans, helped to improve the funded status of the non-U.S. plans, shown in the preceding table. Overall, better-than-expected investment returns generally offset actuarial losses generated by reductions in the discount rate assumption.
The preceding table presents aggregate information for all plans reported. The following table presents the obligation and asset information for only those plans that have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets or plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
 
Assumptions and Investment Policies
In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations and fiscal year-end disclosure, an analysis is performed in which the duration of projected cash flows from significant defined benefit and retiree health care plans are matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available in each country. Additionally, in the U.S. we also consider a bond matching analysis on the projected payment streams of the defined benefit and retiree health care plans. We use the results of the yield curve and bond matching analysis to select the discount rate that matches the duration and payment stream of the benefits in each plan. Each rate is rounded to the nearest quarter of a percent.
The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The assumptions for the non-U.S plans were determined at September 30 and the assumptions for the U.S. plans were determined at December 31.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are based upon actual historical returns, future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. The results are adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. The historical long-term return on the plans' assets has exceeded the selected rates and we believe these assumptions are appropriate based upon the mix of the investments and the long-term nature of the plans' investments.
For 2005, we reduced the rate of return assumption for both the U.S. defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans to 7.0 percent, based upon revised expectations for returns for each asset class and reflecting a decision to move gradually over several years to an asset allocation policy for the U.S. defined benefit plan with less emphasis on equity investments. This allocation move is designed to better match the plan's assets with the liability structure as the plan matures.
The table below shows target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets. The asset allocations for the retiree health care benefit plan are intended to represent the long-term targeted mix rather than a current mix.
 
For the defined benefit plans, it is intended that the investments will be rebalanced when the allocation is not within the target range. Additional contributions are invested consistent with the target ranges and may be used to rebalance the portfolio. The investment allocations and individual investments are chosen with regard to the duration of the obligations of the plan. A small portion of the retiree health care benefit plan assets are invested in an account within the pension trust and are invested in a like manner as the other pension assets. The majority of the assets in the retiree health care benefit plan are invested in a series of Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trusts. For tax efficiency, the investments in the VEBA trusts are not rebalanced but additional contributions to the trusts may be used to reallocate the portfolio.
Weighted average asset allocations for U.S. plans at December 31 and non-U.S. plans at September 30 are as follows:
 
There are no significant restrictions on the amount or nature of the investments that may be acquired or held by the plans. In addition, none of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock.
We did not make any contributions to the trusts for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or the retiree health care benefit plan in 2005. We contributed $127 million and $95 million to the pension and retiree health care trusts in 2004. Our objective is to, at a minimum, fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan subject to tax deductibility limits. Contributions meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute approximately $50 million to U.S. retirement plans and approximately $90 million to non-U.S. retirement plans in 2006.
The following table projects the benefits expected to be paid to participants from the plans in each of the following years. The majority of the payments will be paid from plan assets and not company assets.
 
Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care plan at December 31:
 
Increasing or decreasing health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would have increased (decreased) the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2005, by $13 million/$(12) million and the service cost and interest cost components of 2005 plan expense by $1 million/$(1) million.
Deferred Compensation Arrangements
We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which allows certain highly compensated employees the option to defer the receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus and profit sharing. Employees who participate in the deferred compensation plan can select one of eight distribution options offered by the plan. Payments are made after the employee terminates, based on their distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation that is based on hypothetical investments in the same mutual funds and TI common stock offered in our defined contribution plans. Changes in the market value of these participant investments are reflected as an adjustment to the liability for deferred compensation with an offset to compensation expense.
As of December 31, 2005, the liability to the participants of the deferred compensation plan was $179 million and is recorded in noncurrent liabilities. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. We
make no contributions to the deferred compensation plan and so remain contingently liable to the participants. However, to serve as an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in market values of these hypothetical investments, we invest in similar mutual funds and have entered into a forward purchase contract (explained below). Changes in the fair value of these mutual fund investments are recognized as an offset to compensation expense (see Note 6 for a discussion of investments).
As no shares of TI common stock are actually held for the account of participants, as of December 31, 2005, we have a forward purchase contract with a commercial bank to acquire 1,000,000 shares of TI common stock at a fixed price of $31.38 per share at the end of the contract term or, at our option, to settle in cash with the bank. We are also able, at our discretion, to unwind all or part of this contract prior to the end of the contract term. The contract is intended to be an economic hedge to minimize the earnings impact from the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on the portion of the deferred compensation plan obligations that are denominated in TI stock. The forward contract is marked-to-market with any changes reflected in compensation expense. As of December 31, 2005, participants are prohibited from directing any further transfers to the TI common stock portion of the hypothetical investments, so this hedge will remain at or below 1,000,000 shares of TI common stock in the future.
In December 2004, as a result of certain provisions within the AJCA, the existing deferred compensation plan was closed to deferral elections for compensation earned after 2004. For compensation earned after 2004, we have allowed deferral elections in accordance with the provisions of the AJCA.
16. Profit Sharing Plans
We also sponsor various profit sharing plans, the largest of which is the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan. Profit sharing benefits are generally formulaic and determined by one or more business or company-wide financial metrics. Beginning in 2005, profit sharing expense is determined based on a different formula than was used in 2004. The current plan provides for profit sharing to be paid based solely upon TI's operating margin for the full calendar year. Under this plan, a minimum threshold of 10 percent operating margin must be achieved before any profit sharing is paid. Profit sharing at 10 percent operating margin will be 2 percent of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is 20 percent of eligible payroll, and would only be paid when TI's operating margin meets or exceeds 35 percent for a full calendar year.
We recognized $115 million and $243 million of profit sharing expense under the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan in 2005 and 2004 but no expenses under this plan were recognized in 2003.
Certain profit sharing plans worldwide provide that, depending upon the individual plan, a portion of the profit sharing earned by employees may be contributed to a deferred plan. Several investment options are made available to employees for deferred amounts, including TI common stock. The TI board of directors has authorized the issuance of 36.9 million shares of previously unissued TI common shares for deferred profit sharing and savings plans worldwide. None has been issued in the three years ended December 31, 2005. Instead, the trustees of these plans worldwide have purchased outstanding TI common shares from the open market to fund the requirements of these plans: 2.1 million shares in 2005, 3.0 million shares in 2004 and 12.3 million shares in 2003.
17. Restructuring Actions
2003 Semiconductor Restructuring Action
In 2003, we announced a restructuring action that affected 897 jobs in Semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S. and international locations, as those operations became more productive with fewer people. The total cost of this restructuring action was $84 million. As of December 31, 2005, all employees affected had been terminated, and a balance of $4 million of severance and benefit costs remains to be paid through 2006.
Prior Actions
Prior to 2003, we conducted various restructuring actions, primarily in Semiconductor operations. All charges were complete prior to 2003. As of December 31, 2005, all employees affected had been terminated, and a balance of $10 million of severance and benefit costs remains to be paid through 2008.
The following is a reconciliation of the above-mentioned restructuring accruals:
 
Note: All charges/dispositions are cash items unless otherwise noted.
18. Business Segment and Geographic Area Data
As a result of the sale of the Sensors & Controls business, excluding the RFID operations, we now have two reportable operating business segments: Semiconductor and Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS). The former Sensors & Controls business has been reflected as discontinued operations (see Note 1 and Note 2). Segment results for prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the addition of the RFID operations to the Semiconductor business segment. Our Semiconductor segment designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits. Our core products include analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors, which are used in a broad range of electronic systems. These systems include cellular telephones, personal computers, servers, communications infrastructure equipment, motor controls, automotive equipment and digital imaging systems such as front projectors and high-definition digital televisions. Semiconductor products are sold to original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original-design manufacturers (ODMs), contract manufacturers and distributors. An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has contracted to other manufacturers. An ODM designs and manufactures products for other companies to sell under their brands. Distributors sell TI products directly to a wide range of customers. The semiconductor market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid technological change, pricing pressures, and the requirement of high rates of investment for R&D and for the manufacturing factories and equipment needed to produce advanced semiconductors. We face significant competition in this segment. This business segment represented 96 percent of revenue in 2005.
Our Educational & Productivity Solutions segment is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators. This business segment also provides customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science. E&PS relies on third-party manufacturers to build its products. Our principal competitors in this business are U.S.- and Japan-based companies. The principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market, technology expertise and price. E&PS sells products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers. This business segment represented 4 percent of our 2005 revenue.
Operating profits of these businesses exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, special charges and gains, and acquisition-related amortization, which are included in corporate activities. The results for Semiconductor include the effects of all royalty revenue from semiconductor-related license agreements. Business assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
Also included in corporate activities are general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions (which are generally intended to approximate market prices) and royalty revenue from computer-related license agreements. Assets of corporate activities include unallocated cash, short-term investments, noncurrent investments and deferred income taxes.
Business Segment Information
 
There was no significant intersegment revenue.
The following geographic area data includes trade revenue, based on product shipment destination and royalty payor location, and property, plant and equipment based on physical location:
Geographic Area Information
 
Major Customer
Direct sales to the Nokia group of companies were 11 percent of our revenue in both 2004 and 2005, although if indirect sales such as to contract manufacturers are included, Nokia accounted for more than 11 percent of our 2004 and 2005 revenue. Overall, our sales to Nokia as a percent of revenue were slightly higher in 2005 than in 2004. In 2003, Nokia accounted for 16 percent of revenue.
19. Income Taxes
During 2005, we repatriated approximately $1.29 billion of non-U.S. subsidiary earnings that qualified under the AJCA and recognized a related tax expense of $55 million.
Provision has previously been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional tax liability. The remaining undistributed earnings (approximately $1.01 billion at December 31, 2005) have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not feasible.
Income from continuing operations before Income Taxes
 
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
 
Principal reconciling items from income tax computed at the statutory federal rate follow:
 
The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows:
 
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net deferred income tax assets of $989 million and $963 million were presented in the balance sheet, based on tax jurisdiction, as deferred income tax assets of $1.01 billion and $1.00 billion and deferred income tax liabilities of $23 million and $40 million. We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. While these assets are not assured of realization, our assessment is that a valuation allowance is not required for the remaining balance of the deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria including the existence of (i) deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, (ii) taxable income in prior carryback years, and (iii) future taxable income.
We have aggregate U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately $96 million of which $90 million expire through the year 2023.
20. Commitments and Contingencies
: Italian government auditors have substantially completed a review, conducted in the ordinary course, of approximately $250 million of grants from the Italian government to TI's former memory operations in Italy for 13 separate projects. The auditors have raised a number of issues relating to compliance with grant requirements and the eligibility of specific expenses for the grants. As of December 31, 2005, the auditors have issued audit reports on 12 of the 13 projects. The Ministry of Industry is responsible for reviewing the auditors' findings. Depending on the Ministry's decision, the review may result in a demand from the Italian government that we repay a portion of the grants. We believe that the grants were obtained and used in compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2005, the Ministry has published final decrees on 12 of the projects representing approximately $175 million of grants. We do not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Italian Grants
: We have investments in certain venture capital funds and have committed to provide additional capital to those funds. As appropriate investments are entered into, the venture capital general partners may draw upon those committed additional funds. As of December 31, 2005, we may be required to provide an additional $44 million when the committed funds are called by the venture capital funds' general partners.
Venture Capital Commitments
: We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal provisions and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Rental and lease expense incurred was $126 million in 2005, $124 million in 2004 and $132 million in 2003.
Leases
In mid-2004, we entered into a long-term supply agreement to purchase industrial gases. This agreement is accounted for as an operating lease.
: We have licenses for certain electronic design automation (EDA) software that are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1. The related liabilities are apportioned between current liabilities (accounts payable) and long-term liabilities (other liabilities) on the balance sheet.
Software Licenses
: We have certain purchase commitments that are for normal usage, some of which contain provisions for minimum payments.
Purchase Commitments
: At December 31, 2005, we were committed to make the following minimum payments under operating leases, capitalized software licenses and purchase commitments:
Summary
 
: At December 31, 2005, we had $86 million of unused documentary letters of credit to enable manufacturers of certain products for the E&PS segment to receive payment upon shipment to us.
Letters of Credit
: We routinely sell products with a limited intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal and infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, any future liabilities brought about by the intellectual property indemnities cannot reasonably be estimated or accrued.
Indemnification Guarantees
: We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability, and historically we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Consistent with general industry practice, we enter formal contracts with certain customers in which the parties define warranty remedies. Typically, our warranty for semiconductor products covers three years, an obligation to repair, replace or refund, and a maximum payment obligation tied to the price paid for our products. In some cases, product claims may be disproportionate to the price of our products.
Warranty Costs/Product Liabilities
: We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
General
: In connection with the sale of the former Sensors & Controls business, we have agreed to indemnify Sensata for certain specified litigation matters, as well as other liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Our indemnification obligations with respect to breaches of representations and warranties and the specified litigation matters are, generally, subject to a total deductible of $30 million and our maximum potential exposure is limited to $300 million. There were no significant liabilities recorded under these indemnification obligations.
Discontinued Operations Indemnity
21. Supplemental Cash Flow Information
 
22. Subsequent Events
: On February 6, 2006, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey determined that GlobespanVirata (Globespan), a subsidiary of Conexant Systems, Inc. (Conexant), had infringed two TI patents and one Stanford University (Stanford) patent relating to digital subscriber line (DSL) technology. The jury awarded $112 million in damages to TI. In June 2003, before Globespan's merger with Conexant, Globespan had sued TI and Stanford claiming that the TI and Stanford patents were invalid and not being infringed by Globespan, and alleging violations of the antitrust law. In response, TI and Stanford brought counterclaims of patent infringement against Globespan. On May 5, 2006, the companies announced a settlement resolving this litigation. Under the settlement, Conexant paid TI $70 million and TI granted Conexant a license to essential patents relating to DSL technology. Under an agreement with Stanford, TI will be required to make a payment of $10 million to Stanford related to the royalty amount received by TI from Conexant.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Texas Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation effective July 1, 2005.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2006 (not provided herein), expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. All dollar amounts in the tables in this discussion are stated in millions of U.S. dollars, except per-share amounts, unless otherwise indicated. The former Sensors & Controls business has been reflected as discontinued operations (see Note 2). Additionally, the radio frequency identification (RFID) systems operations that had been part of the Sensors & Controls business segment are included in the Semiconductor business segment. All amounts in this discussion reference continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
Overview
Texas Instruments makes, markets and sells high-technology components; more than 50,000 customers all over the world buy our products. We have two separate business segments: Semiconductor and Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS). Semiconductor is by far the largest of these business segments. It accounted for 96 percent of our revenue in 2005, and historically it averages a higher growth rate than E&PS, although the semiconductor market is characterized by wide swings in growth rates from year to year. We were the world's third-largest semiconductor company in 2005 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from iSuppli Corporation, an industry analyst.
In our Semiconductor segment, we focus primarily on technologies that make it possible for a variety of consumer and industrial electronic equipment to process both analog and digital signals in real time. These technologies are known as analog semiconductors and digital signal processors, or DSPs, and together they account for about three-fourths of our Semiconductor revenue. Almost all of today's digital electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing.
Analog semiconductors process "real world" inputs, such as sound, temperature, pressure and visual images, conditioning them, amplifying them and converting them into digital signals. They also assist in the management of power distribution and consumption, aspects critical to today's portable electronic devices. Generally, analog products require less capital-intensive factories to manufacture than digital products.
Our analog semiconductors consist of custom products and standard products. Custom products are designed for specific applications for specific customers. Standard products include application-specific standard products (designed for a specific application and usable by multiple customers) and high-performance standard catalog products (usable in multiple applications by multiple customers). These standard products are characterized by differentiated features and specifications, as well as relatively high margins. Standard analog products tend to have long life spans. Many custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate. Analog products also include commodity products, which are sold in high volume and into a broad range of applications, and generally are differentiated by price and availability. We are the world's largest supplier of analog semiconductors.
DSPs use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream. These products are ideal for applications that require precise, real-time processing of real-world signals that have been converted into digital form. Their power efficiency is important for battery-powered devices.
Our DSP portfolio includes custom, application-specific and standard products. Custom products are designed for specific customers with very high volumes in established markets. Application-specific products are implementations crafted for specific applications like wireless infrastructure, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) gateways, digital still cameras and residential gateways, to name a few. Our standard DSP products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of signal-processing innovation. We are the world's largest supplier of DSPs.
We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing sites in the Americas, Japan, Europe and Asia. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. Because we own most of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which should improve profit margins.
As part of our manufacturing strategy, we outsource a portion of our product manufacturing to outside suppliers (foundries and assembly/test subcontractors), which reduces both the amount of capital expenditures and subsequent depreciation required to meet customer demands, and fluctuations in profit margins. Outside foundries provided about 20 percent of our total wafers produced in 2005. (A wafer is a thin slice of silicon on which an array of semiconductor devices has been fabricated.)
The semiconductor market is characterized by constant and typically incremental innovation in product design and manufacturing technologies. We make significant investments in research and development (R&D). Typically, products resulting from our R&D investments in the current period do not contribute materially to revenue in that period, but should benefit us in future years. In general, new semiconductor products are shipped in limited quantities initially and will then ramp into high volumes over time. Prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time.
Our E&PS segment is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators. It also provides our customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development that enables students and teachers to interactively explore math and science. Our products are marketed primarily through retailers and to schools through instructional dealers. This business segment represented 4 percent of our revenue in 2005. Prices of E&PS products tend to be stable.
Profit sharing expense in 2005 was $115 million compared with $243 million in 2004. Beginning in 2005, expenses under the TI employee profit sharing plan are determined using a different formula than was used in 2004. The plan now provides for profit sharing to be calculated based solely upon our operating margin for the calendar year, whereas in 2004 profit sharing was calculated based upon operating margin and revenue growth. Under the current plan, a minimum threshold of 10 percent operating margin must be achieved before any profit sharing is paid. Profit sharing at 10 percent operating margin is 2 percent of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is 20 percent of eligible payroll, and is paid only when our operating margin meets or exceeds 35 percent for a full calendar year. We accrue profit sharing based on how we expect to perform for the year in total. The accrual in a given quarter is based on our expectations at that time as to annual performance. The profit sharing accrual is included in cost of revenue, R&D expense, and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. As a result of the change in our profit sharing formula we expect profit sharing expenses to be more stable over time.
In the third quarter of 2005, we implemented the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), The financial results of 2005 include the effects of adopting this new accounting rule for stock options effective July 1, 2005. Before July 1, 2005, our financial results include the expense of restricted stock units, but not stock options. As a result our 2005 financial results are not fully comparable to our prior financial results. For the year, the total stock-based compensation expense was $175 million, or 1.4 percent of revenue. The distribution of this expense was $90 million to SG&A expense, $53 million to R&D expense and $32 million to cost of revenue. See below and Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.
"Share-Based Payments."
Changes in Accounting Standards
As a result of a study of the pattern of usage of long-lived depreciable assets, effective January 1, 2006, we will adopt the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis as allowed for under new SFAS No. 154, See below and Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.
"Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3."
Financial Condition
We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to several types of taxes including taxes based on income, capital, property and payroll, and sales and other transactional taxes. The timing of the final determination of our tax liabilities varies among these jurisdictions and their taxing authorities. As a result, during any particular reporting period, we might reflect (in either income before income taxes, the provision for income taxes or both) one or more tax refunds or assessments, or changes to tax liabilities, involving one or more taxing authorities.
Discontinued Operations
On January 9, 2006, we announced a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the Sensors & Controls segment, excluding the RFID systems operations, to an affiliate of Bain Capital, LLC, for $3 billion in cash. The sale was completed on April 27, 2006. The former Sensors & Controls business acquired by Bain Capital, LLC was renamed Sensata Technologies (Sensata). The RFID operations retained are now included in the Semiconductor business segment.
Products in the former Sensors & Controls business included sensors, electrical and electronic controls. Our primary markets were automotive and industrial. Other targeted markets included heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and industrial control systems.
Results of Operations
2005 Compared with 2004
2005 was our 75th year in operation, and as we crossed that milestone we delivered record annual results for revenue, operating profit, operating margin and operating cash flow. We also gained market share in our core semiconductor technologies of DSP and analog for the fourth consecutive year.
Highlights for 2005 include a reinforced leadership position in semiconductors for wireless cell phones. We exceeded $1 billion of semiconductor revenue in the newest cell-phone generation, known as 3G, by doubling our shipments of OMAP application processors and almost tripling our shipments of baseband modems. (OMAP processors are high-performance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices.) Other highlights include initial shipments of a new family of DSPs for digital video known as DaVinci, our agreement to acquire radio frequency expert Chipcon Group ASA for high-performance analog, customer sampling of our multi-mode Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) chipset for wireless cell phones, and strong consumer acceptance of our DLP technology in 1080p high-definition televisions (HDTVs).
We enter 2006 in excellent health. Customer and channel inventories appear lean, and demand is solid. Overall, we expect the combination of our customers, products and manufacturing abilities will enable us to keep evolving into a company that produces superior revenue and earnings growth on a sustained basis.
Statement of Operations  Selected Items
 
Details of Financial Results
For the year, our revenue reached $12.33 billion, an increase of 7 percent. We also set a new high for operating margin of 20.7 percent.
Diluted income from continuing operations per share was $1.30 for the year and includes stock-based compensation expense of $0.07 for the year.
Gross profit of $6.02 billion, or 48.8 percent of revenue, increased 14 percent from 2004 primarily due to higher gross margin in our Semiconductor business segment. Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $32 million in 2005 compared with zero in 2004.
R&D expense of $1.99 billion, or 16.1 percent of revenue, increased $40 million, or 2 percent from 2004, primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, which was $53 million in 2005 compared with zero in 2004.
SG&A expense of $1.47 billion, or 11.9 percent of revenue, increased 9 percent primarily due to higher stock-based compensation and, to a lesser extent, expenses for DLP product advertising. Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A was $90 million in 2005 compared with $18 million in 2004.
Operating profit for the year was a record $2.56 billion. Operating margin was also a record at 20.7 percent of revenue, increasing 31 percent from 2004 due to higher operating margin in Semiconductor. Total stock-based compensation expense for 2005 was $175 million, or 1.4 percent of revenue, compared with $18 million in 2004.
OI&E decreased $28 million in 2005 to $205 million. Interest income was $165 million, an increase of $29 million, due to higher average interest rates earned on short-term investments. This was offset by lower income in 2005 than in 2004 from settlements related to grants from the Italian government regarding our former memory business operations, and the 2004 favorable settlement with the State of Texas over claims for refund of state sales taxes relating to our former defense electronics business.
In 2005, we recognized net discrete tax items of $92 million, consisting of $147 million primarily associated with favorable developments on certain outstanding income tax matters, partially offset by a $55 million accrual for taxes on dividends from earnings repatriated from our non-U.S. subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The effective tax rate for 2005, which, by definition, does not include discrete tax items, was 24 percent. This compares with the effective tax rate in 2004 of 22 percent. This difference was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2005. The effective tax rate for 2005 of 24 percent differs from the 35 percent corporate statutory rate due to the effect of non-U.S. tax rates and, to a lesser extent, various tax benefits such as for export sales and research activities.
Including the effect of the discrete tax items recognized during 2005, the overall tax rate was 21 percent compared with 22 percent in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2005 was the result of the discrete tax items recognized during the year, partially offset by the impact of the increase in income before income taxes.
For the year, income from continuing operations was $2.17 billion, or $1.30 per share, an increase of 29 percent compared with 2004 income from continuing operations of $1.69 billion, or $0.96 per share.
For the year, net income, which includes income from continuing operations and discontinued operations, was $2.32 billion, or $1.39 per share, an increase of 25 percent compared with 2004 net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.05 per share. Earnings per share growth of 32 percent in 2005 exceeded net income growth, reflecting a net decline of about 100 million shares in the average diluted shares outstanding primarily resulting from our stock repurchase program.
For the year, our orders of $12.84 billion increased 13 percent as demand grew for our Semiconductor products. Semiconductor orders increased 13 percent to $12.34 billion due to broad-based demand for our DSP and analog products.
Semiconductor Segment
Statement of Operations  Semiconductor
 
Semiconductor revenue in 2005 of $11.83 billion increased 7 percent from 2004 primarily due to increased shipments resulting from higher demand for wireless products and, to a lesser extent, increased shipments from higher demand for high-performance analog products.
For the year, wireless revenue grew 14 percent, with success in both the fast-growing 3G WCDMA market, and in supplying chips to the rapidly growing emerging market for low-price cell phones. We believe industry shipments of WCDMA cell-phones doubled in 2005. In 2005, about 55 percent of our 3G revenue came from sales of OMAP application processors and about 45 percent from sales of digital baseband modems.
For the year, high-performance analog revenue grew 13 percent, reflecting the combination of four consecutive quarters of solid growth and the inventory correction that was underway at our distributors at the end of 2004. We exited 2005 with distribution inventory levels of our high-performance analog products lower than they were at the end of 2004, despite resales that were significantly higher.
Gross profit of $5.77 billion, or 48.8 percent of revenue, increased $765 million from 2004, primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and, to a lesser extent, higher revenue.
Operating profit was $2.81 billion, or 23.7 percent of revenue, up $740 million from 2004 due to higher gross profit.
Analog revenue increased 4 percent from 2004 primarily due to increased shipments resulting from growth in demand for high-performance analog products, which more than offset the loss of revenue from our commodity liquid crystal display (LCD) driver product line, which we divested in the first quarter of 2005. In 2005, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from analog.
DSP revenue increased 15 percent from 2004 primarily due to increased shipments resulting from growth in demand for wireless products. In 2005, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from DSP.
For the year, remaining Semiconductor revenue increased 2 percent from 2004 primarily due to higher shipments resulting from increased demand for reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessors (designed to provide very fast computing, typically for a specialized application such as servers), and microcontrollers (a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment) that offset a decline in revenue from DLP products.
We began 2005 with excess inventories of DLP products at both our customers and their channels. Overall DLP revenue declined 8 percent in 2005. We left the year in a much better position, with revenue in the fourth quarter up 10 percent from the year-ago quarter. In 2005, DLP was about 5 percent of Semiconductor revenue, while RISC microprocessors, standard logic, microcontrollers and royalties were under 5 percent each.
In total, we estimate that our 2005 Semiconductor product revenue came from the following broad markets: communications (including wireless and broadband communications) was about 50 percent; computing (including peripherals and computers) was about 30 percent; consumer electronics was about 10 percent; industrial was about 5 percent; and automotive was about 5 percent.
For the year, Semiconductor orders increased 13 percent to $12.34 billion due to broad-based demand for our DSP and analog products.
Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) Segment
Statement of Operations  E&PS
 
E&PS revenue for 2005 was $506 million, down 2 percent from 2004 primarily due to tighter inventory management at retail customers.
Gross profit of $300 million, or a record 59.2 percent of revenue, increased $8 million from 2004 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs.
Operating profit was a record $188 million, or 37.2 percent of revenue, an increase of $12 million from 2004 due to higher gross profit.
Discontinued Operations
Revenue for 2005 from the former Sensors & Controls business was $1.06 billion, up 3 percent from 2004 due to increased shipments resulting from growth in demand for sensor products.
Income from discontinued operations before income taxes was $232 million, or 21.9 percent of revenue, a decrease of $17 million from the prior year primarily due to costs associated with new products.
Income from discontinued operations net of income taxes was $151 million, or $0.09 per share, a decrease of 11 percent compared with 2004 income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $170 million, or $0.10 per share, primarily due to lower operating profit.
2004 Compared with 2003
We delivered excellent growth and improved profitability in 2004 despite a second half that was dampened by inventory adjustments. In the third and fourth quarters of 2004, distributors and other customers adjusted their semiconductor inventories. In response, we took action beginning in the third quarter to sharply reduce factory loadings, which resulted in exiting the year with $102 million lower inventory levels than in the third quarter.
For 2004, our revenue was $11.55 billion, up $2.64 billion or 30 percent from 2003 due to broad-based growth in the Semiconductor segment. Semiconductor revenue increased 31 percent from 2003 due to increased shipments resulting from broad-based demand.
In the E&PS segment, revenue for 2004 increased 7 percent from 2003 on the strength of higher shipments for new graphing calculator products.
Income from continuing operations per share for the year were $0.96 compared with $0.60 in 2003.
Earnings per share for the year were $1.05 compared with $0.68 in 2003.
Details of Financial Results
Gross profit of $5.26 billion, or 45.5 percent of revenue, increased 44 percent from 2003 primarily due to higher revenue.
R&D expense of $1.95 billion, or 16.8 percent of revenue, increased 13 percent from 2003 primarily due to increased product development in Semiconductor, especially for wireless.
SG&A expense of $1.35 billion, or 11.7 percent of revenue, increased 16 percent due to increased levels of marketing, especially for Semiconductor products and, to a lesser degree, higher profit sharing accruals.
For the year, operating profit of $1.96 billion, or 17.0 percent of revenue, increased 156 percent due to higher gross profit.
In 2004, $243 million was accrued for our employee profit sharing plan, including $90 million in cost of revenue, $81 million in SG&A and $72 million in R&D. No profit sharing was accrued in 2003.
OI&E of $233 million decreased by $91 million from 2003 due to lower investment gains that were partially offset, in decreasing order, by the partial settlement of matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding our former memory business operations, higher interest income generated from higher cash balances and higher interest rates, and the resolution of an open sales-tax item associated with our divested defense electronics business. In 2003, OI&E included pre-tax investment gains of $203 million from the sale of our remaining 57 million shares of Micron Technologies, Inc. (Micron) common stock.
For the year, interest expense of $21 million decreased $18 million due to our lower debt level, which primarily resulted from our redemption of $400 million of notes that matured in the third quarter of 2004.
For the year, net income was $1.86 billion, or $1.05 per share, as compared with $1.20 billion, or $0.68 per share for 2003.
The effective annual tax rate for 2004 of 22 percent differs from the 35 percent corporate statutory rate due to the effect of non-U.S. tax rates and, to a lesser extent, various tax benefits such as for export sales and research activities.
The effective annual tax rate was a credit in 2003 compared with 22 percent in 2004. This difference was primarily due to the reversal in 2003 of the $223 million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated in 2002 by the write-down of the investment in Micron stock. The tax rate impact of higher profit was primarily offset by increases in tax benefits and credits.
For the year, our orders of $11.40 billion increased 21 percent due to Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders of $10.88 billion increased 22 percent, reflecting broad-based demand.
Semiconductor Segment
Statement of Operations  Semiconductor
 
Semiconductor revenue of $11.03 billion increased 31 percent from 2003, due to increased shipments resulting from broad-based demand, led by 40 percent growth in wireless revenue, 40 percent growth in high-performance analog revenue and 79 percent growth in DLP product revenue. Revenue from analog products and DSPs represented about 75 percent of total Semiconductor revenue for both 2004 and 2003. From an end-equipment perspective, higher shipments into the wireless market provided the most significant source of growth, as wireless revenue increased more than $1 billion to a record $3.84 billion for the year. Almost $500 million of the wireless revenue growth came from the emerging market for 3G cell phones. Higher DLP shipments reflect the significant share gains in both of its primary markets  front projectors and HDTVs. The higher shipments also reflect the building of excess inventories by both our front projector and HDTV customers and their channels.
Semiconductor gross profit of $5.01 billion, or 45.4 percent of revenue, increased $1.50 billion primarily due to higher revenue.
For the year, operating profit was $2.07 billion, or 18.7 percent of revenue, up $1.09 billion due to higher gross profit.
Analog revenue increased 28 percent from 2003 primarily due to higher shipments as a result of growth in demand for high-performance analog products and wireless products. High-performance analog revenue for the year grew 40 percent due to broad-based demand. In 2004, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from analog.
DSP revenue increased 35 percent from 2003 primarily due to strong demand for wireless products, and, to a lesser extent, catalog and broadband products. The emerging market for 3G handsets was a major contributor to the growth in demand for DSP products for wireless. In 2004, about 35 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from DSP.
Our remaining Semiconductor revenue increased 30 percent primarily due to demand for DLP products. Revenue from DLP products increased 79 percent for the year. In 2004, DLP products were more than 5 percent of Semiconductor revenue, while RISC microprocessors, standard logic, microcontrollers and royalties were under 5 percent each.
Results for our Semiconductor products sold into key end equipments were as follows:
 
 
In total, we estimate that our 2004 Semiconductor revenue came from the following broad markets: communications (including wireless and broadband communications) was about 50 percent of Semiconductor revenue; computing (including computers and peripherals) was about 30 percent; consumer electronics was about 10 percent; automotive was about 5 percent; and industrial and other was about 5 percent.
Semiconductor orders for 2004 increased 22 percent to $10.88 billion due to broad-based demand.
Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) Segment
Statement of Operations  E&PS
 
E&PS revenue for 2004 was a record $518 million, up 7 percent primarily due to increased shipments resulting from higher demand for new graphing calculator products.
For the year, gross profit of $292 million, or 56.4 percent of revenue, increased $25 million primarily due to higher revenue.
Operating profit was a record $176 million, or 34.0 percent of revenue, an increase of $19 million due to higher gross profit.
Discontinued Operations
Revenue for 2004 from the former Sensors & Controls business was $1.03 billion, up 11 percent due to higher shipments resulting from broad-based demand.
Income from discontinued operations before income taxes was $249 million, or 24.2 percent of revenue, an increase of $49 million due to higher revenue.
Income from discontinued operations net of income taxes was $170 million, or $0.10 per share, an increase of 28 percent compared with 2003 income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $133 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily due to higher operating profit.
Financial Condition
At the end of 2005, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $5.33 billion, down $1.02 billion from the end of 2004.
Accounts receivable of $1.65 billion at the end of 2005 increased $103 million from 2004 due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 45 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, down from 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004.
For the year, inventory increased by $15 million compared with the end of 2004, primarily in work-in-process, with fourth-quarter finished goods below desired levels. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 64, the same as at the end of 2004.
Depreciation in 2005 was $1.35 billion, a decrease of $103 million from 2004.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will change our method of depreciation from an accelerated to a straight-line method on our existing and future property, plant and equipment assets. This change is the result of a study that was conducted regarding the usage pattern of our long-lived depreciable assets. The study indicated a trend toward more consistent utilization of assets as we have focused our product portfolio on differentiated products and supplemented our internal semiconductor manufacturing with supply from foundries. As part of the same study, we determined that estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment assets are appropriate and, consequently, will not be changed. Under SFAS No. 154, a change in depreciation method is treated as a change in estimate and prior-period results will not be restated. We expect depreciation to decline about $350 million in 2006 compared with 2005, with about half of this reduction coming from the change in our method of depreciation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is our $1.21 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $4.12 billion of short-term investments, totaling $5.33 billion. Other sources of liquidity are: (a) authorized borrowings of $500 million for commercial paper, backed by a 364-day revolving credit facility, and (b) a new revolving credit facility for $175 million entered into by our Japan subsidiary in connection with our decision to repatriate earnings under the AJCA (see discussion below and in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information). As of December 31, 2005, these facilities were not being utilized.
For the year, cash flow from operations increased $635 million, or 21 percent, to $3.61 billion, primarily due to higher net income.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.63 billion for 2005 compared with $1.12 billion for 2004. In 2005 there were $421 million of net purchases of short-term cash investments compared with $135 million of cash received from net sales of short-term cash investments in 2004.
Capital expenditures of $1.29 billion increased by $28 million from 2004. Our capital expenditures in 2005 were primarily for assembly and test equipment, advanced wafer fabrication equipment and construction of our new 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas.
For 2005, net cash used in financing activities was $3.54 billion compared with $1.15 billion in 2004, primarily reflecting increased repurchases of our common stock. We used $4.15 billion of cash to repurchase 153.2 million shares of our common stock in 2005 compared with $753 million used to repurchase 30.1 million shares of our common stock in 2004. Dividends paid in 2005 of $173 million compared with $154 million in 2004, reflect the effect of increases in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2005. The quarterly cash dividend rate was increased to $0.025 per share beginning with the dividend declared on October 21, 2004. The quarterly cash dividend rate was increased again to $0.03 per share beginning with the dividend declared on October 20, 2005.
Cash proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2005 were $461 million compared with $192 million in 2004. In 2004, we repaid $435 million of maturing long-term debt.
In 2005, to avail ourselves of tax savings provided for under the AJCA, we repatriated $1.29 billion of previously undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. (See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the tax impact.) During the fourth quarter, our Japan subsidiary borrowed $275 million in order to facilitate this process.
At the end of 2005, TI's debt-to-total capital ratio was 0.05, up from 0.03 at the end of 2004 due to the borrowing associated with the non-U.S. earnings repatriation.
In January 2006, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $5 billion of our common stock. Cumulatively, our board of directors has authorized $10 billion in stock repurchases since September 2004.
Long-term Contractual Obligations
 
We believe we have the necessary financial resources to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from sales of our products is recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, the sales amount is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. A portion of our sales is to distributors. We recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors.
We reduce revenue based on estimates of future credits to be granted to customers. Credits are granted for reasons such as prompt payment discounts, volume-based incentives, other special pricing arrangements and product returns due to quality issues. Our estimates of future credits are based on historical experience, analysis of product shipments and contractual arrangements with customers.
Distributor revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management estimates based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. These allowances recognize the impact of credits granted to distributors
under certain programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities, or are allowed to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in their inventory. Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimate as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity.
Royalty revenue is recognized upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as estimated by us, and when realization of payment is considered probable by management. Estimates are based on historical experience and analysis of annual sales results of licensees. Estimates are periodically adjusted as a result of reviews of reported results of licensees, which reviews may take the form of an independent audit. Where warranted, revenue from licensees may be recognized on a cash basis.
In addition, we monitor collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made.
Stock-based Compensation
With the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R), effective July 1, 2005, stock-based compensation changes our financial statements as detailed in Notes 1 and 14 to the Financial Statements. Determining the amount and distribution of expense for stock-based compensation, as well as the associated impact to the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock-based compensation expense. The most significant factors of that expense that require estimates or projections include the expected volatility, expected lives and estimated forfeiture rates of employee stock options.
For grants made prior to July 1, 2005, an analysis of historical volatility was used to develop the estimate of expected volatility. Effective July 1, 2005, we changed our method of determining expected volatility on all options granted after that date to rely solely on available implied volatility rates. After giving consideration to recently available regulatory guidance, we believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of expected volatility. The effect of this change in assumption was not material in 2005 and is not expected to be material in 2006.
The expected lives of options are determined based on our historical share option exercise experience, using a rolling 10-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available.
Estimated forfeiture rates are derived from historical forfeiture patterns. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of forfeitures currently available.
Inventory Valuation Allowances
Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Allowances are determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual materials and parts to historical usage rates, current backlog and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age of inventory, in order to identify specific components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold. In addition to this specific identification process, statistical allowances are calculated for remaining inventory based on historical write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. Inventory is written off in the period in which disposal occurs. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.
Income Taxes
In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.
In addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on current enacted tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We review long-lived assets for impairment when certain indicators are present that suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This review process primarily focuses on intangible assets from business acquisitions; property, plant and equipment; and software for internal use or embedded in products sold to customers. Factors considered include the under-performance of an asset compared to expectations and shortened useful lives due to planned changes in the use of the assets. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of long-lived assets to estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash-flow technique. Additionally, in the case of assets that will continue to be used in future periods, a shortened depreciable life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized. Actual results may vary from estimates due to, among other things, differences in operating results, shorter asset useful lives and lower market values for excess assets.
Changes in Accounting Standards
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, which will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We have completed the evaluation of the impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations, and have concluded that the impact of the change will not be material, as the normal capacity rate to be used is not materially different from the optimal capacity rate previously used.
"Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,"
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, (FSP 115-1 and 124-1), which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 will be effective for us beginning as of January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential impact FSP 115-1 and 124-1 may have on our financial position and results of operations, but do not believe the impact of any changes, if necessary, will be material.
"The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments"
See in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for discussion of other changes in accounting standards.
Changes in Accounting Standards
Adoption of FAS 123(R) for Stock Options
The financial results of 2005 include the effects of adopting new accounting rules for stock-based compensation as of July 1, 2005, and as a result are not fully comparable to the financial results for 2004. Stock-based compensation expense has been allocated to the applicable income statement lines but has not been allocated to the various segments, rather it is reflected in corporate.
We have several stock-based employee compensation plans, more fully described in Note 14 to the Financial Statements, under which we may grant stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and other stock-based awards. Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for awards granted under those plans following the intrinsic value method of recognizing and measuring stock-based awards under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, " and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no compensation cost was reflected in net income for stock options, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant (except options granted under employee stock purchase plans and acquisition-related stock option awards). The terms for stock options offered to employees under TI employee stock purchase plans qualified these awards for exclusion from recognition of compensation cost. Compensation cost was recognized for grants of RSUs based on the market price in effect on the date of grant.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), ," using the modified prospective application method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes the applicable amounts of: (a) compensation cost of all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, July 1, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures), and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)). Results for prior periods have not been restated (see Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R)).
"Share-Based Payments
Included in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, under is a table that reflects what the our financial results would have been for each of the last three years as if the stock-based awards had been accounted for under the fair value method.
Prior Period Pro Forma Presentations,
As of December 31, 2005, the total future compensation cost for continuing operations related to non-vested stock options and RSUs not yet recognized in the statement of income was $435 million and $41 million, with weighted-average periods over which these awards are expected to be recognized of 1.1 years and 1.4 years, respectively. Of that total, $246 million, $163 million, $61 million and $6 million are expected to be recognized in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2005, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Commitments and Contingencies
See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. In this regard, we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2005, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding of $191 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $67 million to sell euros, $41 million to sell Japanese yen and $17 million to buy Korean won). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2004. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by these exchange contracts, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material earnings impact, e.g., based on year-end 2005 balances and rates, a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.
Our long-term debt has a fair value, based on current interest rates, of approximately $634 million at year-end 2005 ($394 million at year-end 2004). Fair value will vary as interest rates change. The following table presents the aggregate maturities and historical cost amounts of the debt principal and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity dates at year-end 2005:
 
Total long-term debt historical cost amount at year-end 2005, was $630 million and year-end 2004 was $379 million.
We had interest rate swaps that changed the characteristics of the interest payments on the underlying notes ($50 million of 7.0% notes which matured on August 15, 2004, $300 million of 6.125% notes due 2006 and $43 million of 8.75% notes due 2007) from fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to achieve a mix of interest rates on our long-term debt which, over time, is expected to moderate financing costs. The effect of these interest rate swaps was to decrease interest expense by $11 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. The year-end 2005 effective interest rates for the notes, including the effect of the swaps, was approximately 3.61% for the $300 million of notes due 2006 and 8.27% for the $43 million of notes due 2007.
Our cash equivalents are debt securities with original maturities equal to or less than three months. Short-term investments are debt securities, including auction-rate securities, with original maturities greater than three months (see Note 3 to Financial Statements). Their aggregate fair value and carrying amount were $5.10 billion at year-end 2005 (fair value and carrying amount were each $6.12 billion at year-end 2004). Fair value will vary as interest rates change.
Equity investments at year-end 2005 consisted of the following (types of investments at year-end 2004 were similar, although we also had a convertible debt security at that date):
 
 
Marketable equity and debt investments are stated at fair value and marked-to-market through stockholders' equity, net of tax. Impairments deemed to be other than temporary are expensed in the Statement of Income. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in investment prices would not affect operating results.
Restructuring Action
In 2003, we announced a restructuring action that affected 897 jobs in Semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S. and international locations, as those operations became more productive with fewer people. The total cost of this restructuring action was $84 million. The projected savings from this restructuring action are estimated to be an annualized $67 million, predominantly comprised of payroll and benefit savings. As of December 31, 2005, all affected employees have been terminated and total net pretax charges of $84 million have been recorded associated with this action. Payments are expected to be completed in 2006.
For more detailed information on the restructuring actions, see Note 17 to the Financial Statements.

Exhibit 99
 
 
DALLAS (January 19, 2007) - Texas Instruments (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced that Gilles Delfassy, senior vice president and head of TIs wireless terminals unit, plans to retire after 28 years with the company. Effective immediately, TI has promoted Greg Delagi to senior vice president and leader of the operation, which develops semiconductors for cell phones
.
Delfassy, 51, has been at the helm of the companys successful wireless terminals unit since its inception in 1995, growing it into a multibillion dollar operation. Under his guidance, TI became the worlds leading supplier of semiconductors for wireless handsets. Delfassy has been a global champion of mobile communications. He and his team introduced a new single-chip cell phone technology called LoCosto, which is bringing affordable cell phones for the first time to people in emerging economies such as China, India and Africa. Among the other accomplishments under his leadership was the development of TIs OMAP
TM
platform, which enables multimedia on cell phones thereby broadening wireless capability beyond voice.
Gilles built an outstanding operation, one that not only transformed TI, but changed the way the world communicates. He leaves a legacy of innovation and growth, said Rich Templeton, TIs president and CEO.
Delagi, 43, is a 22-year TI veteran who for the past 10 years has led development and commercialization of digital signal processors (DSPs), one of the companys core semiconductor technologies and a critical component in the companys wireless product line. He presided over the successful launch of the industrys first 1-gigahertz DSP and the new DaVinci
TM
family of hardware and software for video applications. More recently, he added responsibility for several of the companys systems businesses, creating system-on-chip solutions that encompassed both analog and digital components. Since the late 1990s, he has led TIs effort in semiconductors for wireless basestations, working with customers and operators as his team built the industrys top position in this market.
Greg is a proven leader, able to define and execute successful strategies for both standard and custom markets. He cares intensely about our customers and shares a passion for how mobile communications can impact lifestyles and commerce, Templeton said.
Delfassy and Delagi will work together over the next six months to ensure an orderly transition for customers, suppliers and employees.

Exhibit 99
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation. Also, the Educational & Productivity Solutions segment has been renamed Education Technology to more accurately reflect the strategic focus of this business.
DALLAS (Jan. 22, 2007) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported fourth-quarter 2006 revenue of $3.46 billion. Revenue declined 8 percent compared with the third quarter due to a broad-based decline in company semiconductor product revenue of 5 percent and a seasonal decline in graphing calculator sales. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, revenue grew 4 percent due to higher demand for the companys semiconductor and calculator products.
For the year, TI revenue grew 16 percent to a record $14.25 billion. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand for the companys analog products, especially high-performance analog, and DSP products.
In the fourth quarter, earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.45. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit from the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which was signed into law in December 2006 and was retroactive to the beginning of the year. Also, in the quarter TI signed new patent license agreements to replace agreements that had previously expired. These included catch-up payments resulting in a $0.01 EPS benefit to cover the period between expiration of the prior agreements and signing of the new agreements. EPS included $0.03 of expense for stock-based compensation.
For the year, EPS from continuing operations of $1.69 increased 30 percent from the prior year. EPS in 2006 included a full year of stock-option expense of $0.14 resulting in $0.07 of additional expense compared with the prior year. The company began expensing employee stock options in the third quarter of 2005.
TI delivered important financial achievements in 2006, said Rich Templeton, TI president and CEO. Specifically, our semiconductor revenue grew more than one and a half times faster than the market, our earnings per share increased almost twice as fast as our revenue, and our return on invested capital expanded to 21.5 percent. Most important to these results was our high-performance analog product line, which grew revenue 33 percent and continued to raise the bar on gross margin for the entire company.
As expected, demand in the fourth quarter of the year was unseasonably weak, and we limited production to reduce our inventories. Even with these pressures, our profitability remained relatively stable, reflecting the benefits of our hybrid manufacturing strategy whereby we outsource to foundries a large part of our most costly production. Challenges continue in the first quarter as we operate in an environment where customers want lower levels of inventory and where growth in the wireless market is skewed to low-priced, basic-featured cell phones instead of higher-priced, full-featured phones.
Entering 2007, we challenge ourselves to keep improving performance. One way well do this is by changing the way we develop advanced digital process technology. Instead of separately creating our own core technology, we will work collaboratively with our foundry partners to specify and drive the next generations of digital process technology, and we will continue making products on these technologies in our world-class factories. This is a natural extension of our existing relationships with foundries that will increase our R&D efficiency and our capital efficiency while maintaining our responsiveness to customers. Additionally, we will stop production at an older digital factory and move its manufacturing equipment into several of our analog factories to support greater analog output.
These changes will be made throughout 2007, and when complete are expected to reduce annualized costs by about $200 million. About 500 jobs are expected to be reduced by year end. In total, the company will take restructuring charges of approximately $55 million, about evenly distributed across the four quarters of 2007.
Gross Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.75 billion, or 50.5 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $184 million from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. It was an increase of $91 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower depreciation in the Semiconductor segment. For the year, gross profit was $7.26 billion, or a record 50.9 percent of revenue. This was a 21 percent increase from the prior year due primarily to higher revenue, as well as lower depreciation, in the Semiconductor segment.
Operating Expenses
 
In the fourth quarter, research and development (R&D) expense was $556 million, or 16.0 percent of revenue. R&D expense was down 2 percent from the prior quarter due to seasonally lower pay and benefits. R&D expense increased $63 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher investment in new semiconductor technology, particularly for wireless applications. For the year, R&D expense was $2.20 billion, or 15.4 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $209 million from the prior year due to higher investment in new semiconductor technology and $48 million of additional stock-based compensation expense.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $425 million, or 12.3 percent of revenue. SG&A expense decreased 2 percent from the prior quarter due to seasonally lower pay and benefits, partially offset by higher marketing expense. SG&A expense was $21 million higher than the year-ago quarter primarily because of increased marketing expense. For the year, SG&A expense was $1.70 billion. This was an increase of $226 million from the prior year primarily due to the combination of higher marketing expense in the Semiconductor segment and $77 million of higher stock-based compensation expense.
Operating Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, operating profit was $767 million, or 22.1 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $163 million from the prior quarter primarily due to lower gross profit in the Semiconductor segment. Operating profit was up slightly from the year-ago quarter. For the year, operating profit was $3.37 billion, or a record 23.6 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $808 million, or 32 percent, due to higher gross profit in the Semiconductor segment.
In the fourth quarter, total stock-based compensation expense of $78 million, or 2.3 percent of revenue, was included in Corporate. This was about even with the prior quarter and a $7 million decrease from the year-ago quarter. For the year, total stock-based compensation was $332 million. This was an increase of $157 million from the prior year, as 2006 was the first full year for employee stock-option expensing, which the company began in the third quarter of 2005.
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
In the fourth quarter, OI&E was $70 million. This was an increase of $15 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $19 million from the year-ago quarter, both due to the settlement of all remaining matters related to grants from the Italian government regarding TIs former memory business operations. For the year, OI&E was $265 million. This was an increase of $60 million from 2005 primarily due to higher interest income.
Net Income
 
In the fourth quarter, income from continuing operations was $671 million, or $0.45 per share.
For the year, income from continuing operations was $2.64 billion, or $1.69 per share. Net income was $4.34 billion, or $2.78 per share. This includes $1.09 per share from discontinued operations, almost all of which was from the gain on the sale of the companys former Sensors & Controls business.
 
The fourth quarter included a cumulative adjustment to income tax expense for the federal research tax credit, which was signed into law in December and was retroactive to the beginning of the year. The overall tax rate, including discrete items and the research tax credit, was 27 percent for 2006.
Orders
 
TI orders were $3.08 billion. This was a decrease of $352 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $411 million from the year-ago quarter. The decreases were primarily due to lower demand for DSP and DLP
products in the companys Semiconductor segment. For the year, TI orders were $14.02 billion. This was an increase of $1.17 billion from the prior year primarily due to higher demand for the companys analog products.
Cash
 
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $846 million. This was an increase of $427 million from the prior quarter primarily due to changes in working capital. For the year, cash flow from operations was $2.45 billion. This was a decrease of $1.15 billion from the prior year primarily due to changes in working capital, particularly for the payment of income taxes related to the gain on the sale of the companys former Sensors & Controls business, that more than offset higher income from continuing operations.
Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $3.72 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This was down $467 million from the end of the prior quarter and down $1.61 billion from the end of 2005. In the fourth quarter, the company used $1.13 billion to repurchase 37 million shares and paid $59 million in dividends. For the year, the company used $5.30 billion to repurchase 172 million shares, reducing shares outstanding by 9 percent. In 2006, the company received $3.00 billion of cash from the sale of its former Sensors & Controls business.
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were $214 million. This was a decrease of $62 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $120 million from the year-ago quarter.  TIs capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were primarily for equipment used in the assembly and test of semiconductors. For the year, capital expenditures were $1.27 billion. This was about the same as the prior year. TIs 2006 capital expenditures were primarily for equipment used in the assembly and test of semiconductors, as well as for advanced wafer fabrication equipment used to manufacture semiconductors.
In the fourth quarter, depreciation was $249 million. This was a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $87 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, depreciation was $1.05 billion. This was a decrease of $294 million compared with 2005. About half of this decline was due to the companys change at the beginning of 2006 from an accelerated to a straight-line method of depreciation.
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable were $1.77 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This was a decrease of $315 million from the prior quarter primarily due to lower revenue. Accounts receivable increased $126 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher revenue.
Days sales outstanding were 46 at the end of the fourth quarter compared with 50 at the end of the prior quarter and 45 at the end of 2005.
Inventory was $1.44 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This was a decrease of $54 million from the prior quarter as the company reduced production levels. Compared with a year ago, when inventory was below desired levels, inventory increased $252 million. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 75 compared with 73 at the end of the prior quarter and 64 a year ago.
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on March 12, 2007, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the companys web site.
For the first quarter of 2007, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.34.
In 2007, TI expects: the annual effective tax rate to be about 28 percent,

Exhibit 99
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
 
DALLAS (July 23, 2007) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported revenue of $3.42 billion for the second quarter of 2007. Revenue increased 7 percent compared with the prior quarter as demand for the companys semiconductor products began to rebound following an inventory correction in the semiconductor market. Growth also benefited from a seasonal increase in demand for the companys graphing calculator products. Revenue decreased 7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter due to lower demand across a broad base of products.
 
Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.42. This was a $0.07, or 20 percent, increase from the prior quarter and a $0.05 decrease from the year-ago quarter. In the year-ago quarter, financial results included EPS benefits of $0.03 from a sales tax refund and $0.02 associated with a favorable royalty settlement. The royalty settlement also contributed $70 million to revenue in the year-ago quarter.
 
Our attention to customers and growing focus on analog continue to help us deliver stronger financial results, said Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer.  Moreover, we see even greater opportunities ahead as the market regains momentum.  With TIs broad product portfolio, spanning both analog and digital signal processing technologies, we are in a unique position to support customers working on hundreds of electronics applications across the globe.  We also see potential to expand our margins, and we recently raised our profitability goals to 55 percent gross margin and 30 percent operating margin. We expect to meet these goals within the next few years. 
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit was $1.78 billion, a record 52.1 percent of revenue. This was up $147 million from the prior quarter due to higher revenue. It was down $123 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the combination of the royalty settlement and sales tax refund in the year-ago quarter, as well as lower revenue.
 
Operating Expenses
 
 
Research and development (R&D) expense was $551 million. This was about even with the prior quarter.
R&D expense increased $15 million from the year-ago quarter due to the favorable impact of the sales tax refund a year ago.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $424 million. This was an increase of $19 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, as well as seasonally higher marketing expenses for graphing calculators. SG&A expense was about even with the year-ago quarter
.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit was $809 million, or 23.6 percent of revenue. This was an increase of $129 million from the prior quarter due to higher gross profit. It was a decrease of $144 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the combination of the royalty settlement and sales tax refund in the year-ago quarter.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E was $56 million. This was an increase of $16 million from the prior quarter primarily due to the impairment of an investment in the prior quarter. OI&E declined $32 million from a year ago primarily due to a benefit associated with the sales tax refund in the year-ago quarter, as well as lower interest income.
 
Income
 
Income from continuing operations was $614 million, or $0.42 per share.
 
Orders
 
TI orders were $3.45 billion. This was an increase of $247 million, or 8 percent, from the prior quarter due to higher demand for semiconductor products and seasonally stronger demand for calculators. Orders declined $455 million from the year-ago quarter due to lower demand for semiconductor products that more than offset a $50 million increase in demand for calculators.
 
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations was $898 million. This was an increase of $344 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a reduced need for cash to meet working capital requirements, such as the payment of annual profit sharing and bonus that was made in the prior quarter. Higher net income also contributed to the increase in cash flow from operations. Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $3.58 billion at the end of the second quarter. This was an increase of $245 million from the end of the prior quarter and a decrease of $2.09 billion from the year-ago quarter, which included $2.98 billion from the sale of the companys former Sensors & Controls business in that quarter. In the second quarter of 2007, the company used $742 million to repurchase 21 million shares of common stock, paid $115 million in dividends to shareholders and retired $43 million of debt on its maturity date. Since the end of the year-ago quarter, the company has used $4.42 billion to repurchase 143 million shares of common stock and paid $278 million in dividends.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
 
 
Capital expenditures were $174 million. This was a decrease of $5 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $200 million from the year-ago
quarter due to lower expenditures for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
 
TIs capital expenditures in the quarter were primarily for equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductors, especially assembly and test equipment.
 
Depreciation was $256 million. This was an increase of $4 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $11 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable were $1.90 billion at the end of the second quarter. This was an increase of $141 million from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and a decrease of
$32 million from the year-ago quarter due to lower revenue.
Days sales outstanding were 50 at the end of the second quarter compared with 50 at the end of the prior quarter and 47 at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory was $1.42 billion at the end of the second quarter. This was an increase of
$15 million from the prior quarter as the company built inventory of graphing calculators in preparation for the back-to-school sales season. Compared with a year ago, inventory increased $89 million primarily due to replenishment of high-performance analog product inventory from less-than-desirable levels a year ago. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter were 78 compared with 82 at the end of the prior quarter and 67 a year ago.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on
September 11, 2007, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the companys web site.
 
For the third quarter of 2007, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
   
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.52.
 
This estimate assumes that the sale of the companys broadband DSL customer-premises equipment semiconductor product line will close at the end of July. The EPS estimate does not include the expected gain on the sale.
 
In 2007, TI still expects
: an annual effective tax rate of about 28 percent, R&D expense of about $2.2 billion, capital expenditures of about $0.9 billion and depreciation of about $1
.0 billion.
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in the prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Exhibit 99
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations.  The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
 
   
DALLAS (Oct. 22, 2007)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported third-quarter 2007 revenue of $3.66 billion.  Revenue increased 7 percent compared with the prior quarter primarily due to increased demand for analog semiconductor products.  Back-to-school demand for graphing calculators also contributed to sequential growth.  TI revenue decreased 3 percent from a year ago when customers were building inventory.
 
Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.52.  This was an increase of $0.10, or 24 percent, from the prior quarter and $0.07, or 16 percent, from the year-ago quarter.  The third quarters financial results included a gain of $0.02 from the sale of the companys semiconductor product line for broadband DSL customer-premises equipment.  The gain on sale was included in the companys most recent business outlook issued September 11, 2007.
 
Strong growth in analog was at the core of our performance in the third quarter.  Our investments in analog technology have led to broader and deeper engagements with customers.  As a result, this part of our business, which delivers about 40 percent of our revenue, grew 10 percent sequentially, said Rich Templeton, TI's president and chief executive officer.  Our growth allows us to continue to increase our return to shareholders.  In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.4 billion of our stock.  In September, our Board authorized an additional $5 billion in repurchases, and we announced a 25 percent increase in the dividend. 
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit was $1.98 billion, or 54.2 percent of revenue.  This was up $200 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher revenue, as well as a gain of $39 million on the sale of TIs DSL product line that is included in cost of revenue.  Gross profit was up $52 million from the year-ago quarter as a combination of reduced manufacturing costs and the gain on sale more than offset the impact of lower revenue.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Research and development (R&D) expense was $542 million.  This was a decrease of $9 million from the prior quarter and $28 million from the year-ago quarter.  The declines were due to progress in implementing the companys advanced CMOS process development strategy.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $429 million.  This was about even with both the prior and year-ago quarters.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, or 27.6 percent of revenue.  This was an increase of $204 million from the prior quarter due to higher gross profit, and an increase of $83 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit and lower R&D expense.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net (OI&E)
 
OI&E was $53 million.  This was a decrease of $3 million from the prior quarter and $1 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Income
 
Income from continuing operations was $758 million, or $0.52 per share.  Income from discontinued operations was $18 million due to a reduction of a state tax liability associated with the sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business.
 
Orders
 
TI orders were $3.55 billion.  This was an increase of $103 million from the prior quarter as higher demand for semiconductor products more than offset a seasonal decline in orders for graphing calculator products.  Orders were up $125 million from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand for semiconductor products.
 
Cash
 
Cash flow from operations was $1.53 billion.  This was an increase of $633 million from the prior quarter primarily due to the receipt of a tax refund and higher net income.  Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $3.67 billion at the end of the third quarter.  This was an increase of $88 million from the end of the prior quarter and a decrease of $515 million from the year-ago quarter.  In the third quarter of 2007, the company used $1.41 billion to repurchase 40 million shares of common stock and paid $114 million in dividends to shareholders.  Since the end of the year-ago quarter, the company has used $4.14 billion to repurchase 127 million shares of common stock and paid $346 million in dividends.
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures were $152 million.  This was a decrease of $22 million from the prior quarter and $124 million from the year-ago quarter due to lower expenditures for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  TIs capital expenditures in the quarter were primarily for semiconductor assembly and test equipment.
 
Depreciation was $262 million.  This was an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $4 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventories
 
Accounts receivable were $2.02 billion at the end of the third quarter.  This was an increase of $126 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $66 million from the year-ago quarter due to changes in revenue.  Days sales outstanding were 50 at the end of the third quarter, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter.
 
Inventory was $1.45 billion at the end of the third quarter.  This was an increase of
$26 million from the prior quarter.  Compared with a year ago, inventory decreased $41 million.  Days of inventory at the end of the third quarter were 78, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter and up from 73 a year ago.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on
December 10, 2007, by issuing a press release and holding a conference call.  Both will be available on the companys web site.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2007, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.54.
 
In 2007, TI continues to expect R&D expense of about $2.2 billion and depreciation of about $1.0 billion.  TI now expects an annual effective tax rate of about 29 percent compared with the prior expectation of 28 percent, and capital expenditures of about $0.7 billion compared with the prior expectation of $0.9 billion. 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in the prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (January 17, 2008)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced that Chairman of the Board Thomas J. Engibous will retire following the companys 2008 stockholders meeting on April 17.   His retirement caps a career during which he led the transformation of TI into one of the semiconductor industrys best-performing and most admired companies.  Richard K. Templeton, who has worked side-by-side with Engibous for the last 15 years, will become the companys new chairman, in addition to his current position as president and chief executive officer.
 
Tom and Rich have shared a common vision of Texas Instruments as a company committed to integrity, quality and innovation.  Both are leaders who drive for results and make a difference, and they along with the people of TI have lifted the company to become one of the most respected in its industry, said David L. Boren, speaking on behalf of the board of directors.   This is a carefully planned transition that has been in process for a number of years.  Rich already has built a great record of leadership and is well-qualified to take this next step as chairman, Boren said.
 
Since 1996, when Engibous became CEO, the value of the companys share price has increased almost 5X.  His contributions are immense and enduring, Templeton said of Engibous.  He focused TI on semiconductor technologies that could drive electronics to new levels of innovation.  Most importantly, he taught us that the only way for TI to succeed was to help our customers succeed.  He knew that the key to building a company in which people would want to invest their time, their trust and their money lay in its ability to care for its customers.
 
Engibous, who turns 55 in January, joined the company in 1976 after graduating from Purdue University.  His ability to inspire people, assess opportunities and connect TIs capabilities with the markets needs earned him loyalty and respect, and cemented his reputation as a strong leader.  He was named president of the companys semiconductor group in 1993, a member of the board of directors in 1996, president and CEO in 1996, and chairman in 1998.
 
Templeton, 49, joined TI after graduating from Union College in 1980.  Early in his career, he demonstrated impressive capability for both the strategic and operational sides of business, as well as a keen understanding of where markets were going and how TI should position itself to succeed in them.  He advanced quickly, becoming president of the companys semiconductor group in 1996, chief operating officer in 2000, and president and CEO in 2004.
 
As CEO, Templeton has invested in R&D and acquisitions to elevate TIs portfolio of analog semiconductors, putting the company in a strong position for future growth as the need for analog continues to expand around the world.  In addition, Templeton has profoundly reshaped the companys manufacturing strategy to increase operating efficiency, get more out of R&D investments and be more responsive to customer demand.  As a result, TIs return on invested capital has more than doubled since 2004, and its operating profit has increased more than 70 percent.
 
About his years at TIs helm, Engibous said, Leading TI has been an honor I never imagined would be mine.  It was challenging, exciting and fulfilling, even when markets were stubborn and economies were unpredictable.  I have worked with great people all over the world, and it has been a pleasure.  Rich is an experienced leader with strong character, intellect and an incomparable ability to analyze business opportunities.  The strategic path that he and his team have chosen is grounded in growth, and I am confident that TI and its shareholders will be well-served.  I look forward to where they will take this company.

Growth resumed in the fourth quarter with a revenue increase of 3 percent from the same quarter a year ago.  This growth was led by demand for TIs digital signal processors and high-performance analog products, which were up 12 percent each.  Gross profit increased 10 percent and operating profit increased 30 percent, reflecting the quality of the company's product portfolio the efficiency of its manufacturing strategiesand effective expense management.   For the year, cash flow from operations was a record $4.41 billion and return on invested capital was more than 25 percent.
,
 
It was a good quarter and a good year for TI.  We delivered more value to shareholders and built momentum with customers.  Perhaps most important to our future performance, we sharpened our focus on analog with increases in dedicated research and development, sales support and manufacturing capacity.  Evidence of our potential in this area was notable in high-performance analog where we again made substantial market share gains, said Rich Templeton, TI president and chief executive officer.  We move into the first quarter of 2008 expecting year-over-year growth to accelerate in our semiconductor operations. 
Details of financial performance for both the fourth quarter and the year are in the following paragraphs.

Exhibit 99
 
 
Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations.  The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
DALLAS (April 21, 2008)  Financial results from Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN) for the first quarter reflect the companys strengthening position in the market for analog semiconductors.
 
TI revenue was up 3 percent from the year-ago quarter, led by 20 percent growth in high-performance analog semiconductors.  TIs operating profit grew 19 percent.  Analog is making us stronger and will be a great growth opportunity for a very long time.  Analog goes into almost every piece of electronic equipment that is made, and at TI we have the technology and the manufacturing power to serve much more of this market than we are addressing today.  There also are clear benefits to our operating profit, which has grown faster than revenue, and to our cash flow, which we can return to shareholders or reinvest in growth," said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and CEO.
 
Compared with the fourth quarter, TI revenue declined 8 percent primarily due to weaker sales into cell phones, especially high-end cell phones.  Given uncertainty in the near-term economy, we have become more conservative with our outlook for the second quarter.  More strategically, we believe our long-term opportunity is excellent.  Were continuing to do the things needed to be the better choice for our customers, such as adding sales and applications engineers, investing in new products, and increasing assembly/test capability, Templeton said.
 
In addition to traditional markets in communications and entertainment, analog semiconductors and digital signal processors are at the heart of solving some of the worlds most challenging problems in healthcare, energy and security.  Weve achieved early positions in each of these, all of which are just beginning to leverage semiconductor technology, Templeton said.

. .  Every owner of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate in such form not inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation as the Board of Directors shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of stock of the Corporation owned by him. The certificates representing shares of the respective classes of such stock (if there be more than one) shall state the name of the person owning the shares represented thereby, shall be numbered in the order in which they shall be issued, and shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or the President or an Executive Vice President or a Group Vice President or a Senior Vice President or a Vice President or by the Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Treasurer or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and its seal shall be affixed thereto; provided, however, that where such certificate is countersigned by (1) a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or (2) a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, if the Board of Directors shall by resolution so authorize, any of the signatures of the foregoing officers of the Corporation and the seal of the Corporation may be facsimile.

The person in whose name shares of stock are registered on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed and treated as the owner thereof for all purposes; and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.
Section 2
   
Transfers of Stock
 
. .  The Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-Laws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of the stock of the Corporation.  It may appoint one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate, require the owner of the lost, destroyed, or stolen certificate or his legal representatives to give the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties, as the Board shall in its uncontrolled discretion determine, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, destruction, or theft of any such certificate, or the issuance of such new certificates.
Section 4
   
Lost, Destroyed, Stolen, and Mutilated Certificates
 
. .  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.
Section 5
   
Fixing Record Date
 
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
 
 
The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in the form of a circle and shall bear the full name of the Corporation, the state and year of incorporation, and the words Corporate Seal.  Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced. The seal shall be retained by the Secretary.  A duplicate of the seal may be kept and used by the Treasurer, by an Assistant Secretary or Assistant Treasurer, or by any other employee authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors.
 
 
 
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall begin on the first day of January and end on the thirty-first day of December in each year.
 
 
 
Whenever under the provisions of the law of the State of Delaware, of the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-Laws notice of any nature is required to be given to any director, officer or stockholder, unless otherwise provided by law or expressly provided by these By-Laws, such notice may be given personally, or it may be given in writing by depositing the same in the post office or a letter box maintained and kept by the United States Government in a postpaid sealed envelope addressed to such director, officer or stockholder at such address as appears upon the books of the Corporation, or, in default of other address, to such director, officer or stockholder at the general post office in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be thus mailed; a waiver of such notice in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a telegram, cable or wireless sent by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
 
 
 
The Board of Directors shall cause to be published and submitted to the stockholders, at least fifteen days in advance of their annual meeting, the Corporations annual financial statement covering the previous fiscal year, and containing such other information and data as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate.
 
 
 
These By-Laws, as they shall be at any time and whether or not previously altered, amended or added to, may be made, altered, amended or repealed from time to time by the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors at any regular or special meeting of directors if notice of the proposed change was contained in the notice of such meeting.  The stockholders also, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote may from time to time make, alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws at any regular or special meeting if notice of the proposed change was contained in the notice of the meeting; and any addition, alteration, amendment or repeal effected by the Board of Directors may be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders in the manner hereinabove set forth.

The Registrant's news release dated July 21, 2008, regarding its second quarter 2008 results of operations and financial condition is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
ITEM 9.01.  Exhibits
 
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This report includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management believes, expects, anticipates, foresees, forecasts, estimates or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements in this report that describe the Companys business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or its management:
 
 
For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the text under the heading Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Companys most recent Form 10-K.  The forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 8-K are made only as of the date of this report, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
www.ti.com/ir
Beginning with this earnings release, TI will describe revenue in four
product
categories:  Analog, Embedded Processing, Wireless and Other.  For a complete description of these changes, please reference the materials
 
from the companys conference call and webcast
, held
on
July 1, 2008
, available at
 
www.ti.com/ir
.
DALLAS (July 21, 2008)  Texas Instruments (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced second-quarter revenue of $3.35 billion, net income of $588 million and earnings per share of $0.44.
Our core areas of Analog and Embedded Processing delivered solid revenue growth, said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and CEO.  Each grew sequentially and increased 10 percent from a year ago.  These technologies are critical to thousands of different types of electronic equipment, making them some of the most attractive markets in the semiconductor industry.  We believe our portfolio combined with our passion to help customers solve critical problems will drive good long-term growth.
In total, TIs revenue in the second quarter was in the lower half of the companys range of expectations, as were earnings per share.  Demand slowed unexpectedly in June primarily because distributors reduced inventory levels and did not replenish them late in the quarter.  Additionally, Wireless revenue declined in the quarter, continuing its first-quarter weakness.
We believe this slower demand was due to a mix of reasons, including a weaker economic environment and greater confidence in TIs ability to deliver products within short lead times, Templeton said.  Our orders were up in the quarter and backlog grew, but we are cautious given the demand environment we just experienced.  If demand strengthens as quickly as it slowed, we are well-positioned to meet it.
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.  Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations.  The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
 
Revenue
TIs revenue declined 2 percent compared with the second quarter of last year as growth in Analog and Embedded Processing was not sufficient to offset declines in Wireless and Other revenue.  Revenue grew 2 percent compared with the prior quarter as growth in Analog, Embedded Processing and Other more than offset the decline in Wireless.
 
 
Additional financial information
Outlook
For the third quarter of 2008, TI expects:
TI will update its third-quarter outlook on September 9, 2008.
For the full year of 2008, TI continues to expect approximately the following:

DALLAS (Oct. 20, 2008)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $3.39 billion, net income of $563 million and earnings per share of $0.43.
We entered the third quarter with a cautious view of the economy and its impact on our markets.  Revenue was weak, as expected, because consumers and corporations reduced their spending in this uncertain economy, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Even so, the soundness of our strategic direction was underscored by results from our core businesses.  Revenue for our Analog business was steady and revenue for our Embedded Processing business grew 9 percent compared with a year ago.  Although not immune to near-term economic pressures, these are two of the best long-term opportunities in our industry.  We are a leader in each and expect to strengthen our position even in this period of economic weakness.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is for revenue to decline substantially based on weak order trends over the past few months.  In anticipation of declining demand, we reduced our own inventory aggressively in the third quarter, which brought factory utilization down and put additional pressure on our profitability.  We also worked closely with our distributors to reduce the inventory in our channels.  We will accelerate our inventory reduction in the fourth quarter.  We also will continue to reduce expenses and capital spending.  At the same time, we will continue to invest in opportunities to strengthen our positions in Analog and Embedded Processing.
TI also announced today it is taking actions that will reduce expenses by about one-third, or more than $200 million annualized, in its Wireless business, especially in its cellular baseband operation.  The company is also actively pursuing the sale of the merchant portion of this operation and is in discussions with potential buyers.  In the custom portion of this operation, TI will continue to support select programs.
TI will focus its remaining Wireless investments in OMAP applications processors, which are at the heart of many of todays most exciting smartphone products.
TM
Smartphones are growing rapidly and our handset customers are differentiating their product lines through applications and user interfaces.  We anticipated this opportunity and have been investing in it for more than a decade.  As a result, our OMAP applications processors lead the market, and we will concentrate on extending this lead, Templeton said.
Reductions in cellular baseband operations will begin immediately and are expected to be complete by June 2009.  The full annualized savings of more than $200 million will be achieved once these reductions are complete.  The company expects to take restructuring charges of approximately $110 million across the next three quarters.
 
Financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.  Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations.  The sale of TIs former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
Revenue
TIs revenue declined 8 percent compared with the third quarter of last year as growth in Embedded Processing was more than offset by declines in Wireless and Other revenue.  Revenue was about even with the prior quarter.
 
Revenue by product category for historical periods reflects minor reclassifications to previously reported amounts.
 
The product categories include:
 &
Analog:
 
high-performance analog, high-volume analog
logic
 
Embedded Processing:
 
catalog, communications infrastructure and automotive DSPs
and microcontrollers
 
Wireless:
 
basebands, OMAP applications processors,
connectivity products for handsets
Other:  DLP products, calculators, RISC microprocessors, ASIC products, royalties
Additional financial information
 
Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2008, TI expects:
Semiconductor revenue is expected to decline in the range of 10 percent from the third quarter and Education Technology is expected to decline seasonally.
This EPS estimate includes a $0.05 benefit from the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which was signed into law in October 2008 and was retroactive to the beginning of the year.  The estimate also includes charges of about $0.01 per share associated with the companys restructuring actions in its Wireless business.
TI will update its fourth-quarter outlook on December 8, 2008.
For the full year of 2008, TI expects approximately the following:
*  Includes the full-year impact of the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which reduces the annual effective tax rate by about 2 percentage points.

ITEM 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Officers
Effective January 1, 2009, the Registrant's Board of Directors adopted two compensation plans, the TI Deferred Compensation Plan and the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II, to address the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted thereunder, as well as administrative requirements.  A brief description of the terms and conditions of each of the new plans is below, and both are filed as exhibits hereto.
:
TI Deferred Compensation Plan
The TI Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) permits any U.S. employee of the Registrant whose base salary exceeds a level determined by either the Registrants Compensation Committee or management ($135,000 per year in 2008), to defer the receipt of a portion of his or her salary, bonus and profit sharing.  The Registrants existing deferred compensation plan was merged into the DCP.  Deferred compensation account balances are unsecured and all amounts remain part of the companys operating assets.  The balances of the deferred compensation accounts track the performance of investment alternatives selected by the participant.  The Registrant does not guarantee any minimum return on the amounts deferred.  Deferred amounts, including any earnings on the deferred amounts, are generally distributed on a date selected by the participant or on the participants death or entry of a qualified domestic relations order.  Because it is impossible to determine which, if any, of the Registrants executive officers will participate in the DCP, what investment alternatives such executive officers would select and the performance of the investment alternatives, it is impossible to determine what amounts would be payable under the DCP to the executive officers.
:
TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II
The TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II (the Non-qualified Plan) provides supplemental pension benefits to employees who (a) participate in the Registrants qualified defined benefit pension plan but earn a benefit that exceeds the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) limit on annual pension benefits payable ($185,000 in 2008 ) or on qualified plan compensation ($230,000 in 2008) , or (b) elected to participate in the TI Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") and as a result had certain compensation excluded from consideration under the qualified pension plan.   The benefit under the Non-qualified Plan is the amount by which the qualified pension plan benefit accrued after 2004 (absent the applicable IRS limits or exclusion of DCP elective deferrals) exceeds such benefit (with the applicable IRS limits and exclusion of DCP elective deferrals).  Amounts earned under the Non-qualified Plan are distributed upon separation from service to the Registrant, or upon the participants death or entry of a qualified domestic relations order.  Presently, it is impossible to determine what amounts will be payable under the Non-qualified Plan to the executive officers of the Registrant because of the uncertainty of the executive officers future compensation or DCP deferral elections.
 
ITEM 9.01.  Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10(a)
 
 
 
Texas Instruments Incorporated, a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Dallas, Texas (hereinafter referred to as TI or the Company), froze the TI Deferred Compensation Plan (the Frozen DCP), effective as of December 31, 2004, to new participants, to new elective deferrals and to benefits under the Frozen DCP to the extent benefits under that plan were earned and vested as of that date.  Effective as of January 1, 2005, TI established a new deferred compensation plan (the New Plan) in order (i) to provide a select group of management or highly compensated employees described in Section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) with the opportunity to defer payment of certain compensation and benefits earned from and after January 1, 2005 to a later date, (ii) to provide for the payment of benefits under the Frozen DCP which were not earned and vested as of January 1, 2005, and (iii) to restore certain benefits earned and/or vested on or after January 1, 2005, which cannot be provided under the TI Contribution and 401(k) Savings Plan or the TI 401(k) Savings Plan as a result of that deferral of compensation or by reason of the application of Section 401(a)(17) and/or Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), all in accordance with the interim guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code.  The benefits provided under the New Plan are unfunded with the result that the participants in the Plan are general unsecured creditors of TI.  TI hereby amends and restates the New Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009 (the A&R Plan or the Plan), in the form provided herein in order, among other things, to establish the name of the A&R Plan as the TI Deferred Compensation Plan and to comply with the Final Treasury Regulations of Section 409A of the Code.
Prior to January 1, 2009, the deferral of amounts and restoration of benefits pursuant to the New Plan was governed by the applicable interim guidance under Section 409A of the Code in effect prior to January 1, 2009, and the deferral of compensation earned from and after January 1, 2009 and the restoration of benefits from and after January 1, 2009, as well as all amounts in a Participants Accounts on or after January 1, 2009, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this A&R Plan.
Effective as of November 1, 2008, the Frozen DCP was merged into the New Plan in order to permit the election provisions described in this A&R Plan which took effect as of November 1, 2008 to apply to all of the amounts under the Frozen DCP, except for the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals, and as a result of that merger and material modification of the Frozen DCP, it became subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code as of November 1, 2008, for all of the amounts in the Frozen DCP other than the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals.  The amounts in the accounts of the participants in the Frozen DCP (except for the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals) were governed by the terms and conditions of the New Plan until January 1, 2009 (except for the election provisions set forth herein which took effect as of November 1, 2008), and from and after January 1, 2009, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this A&R Plan.  The terms of the Frozen DCP as in effect prior to November 1, 2008 shall remain applicable to and shall govern the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals.  In addition, any amounts in pay status as of November 1, 2008, whether originally payable from the Frozen DCP or the New Plan, shall continue to be payable pursuant to the terms of the Frozen DCP as in effect prior to November 1, 2008 or the New Plan, as the case may be.

Construction

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Dallas, Texas (hereinafter referred to as TI or the Company), froze the TI Employees Supplemental Pension Plan (the "Frozen Plan"), effective as of December 31, 2004, to the extent benefits under that plan were earned and vested as of that date, and continued said plan in accordance with its terms, to provide for the payment of the benefits which were earned, vested and frozen as of December 31, 2004.  Subsequently, TI changed the name of the Frozen Plan to the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan.
 
Effective as of January 1, 2005, TI established a new non-qualified pension plan (the New Plan) in order to provide (i) for the payment of the frozen earned benefits under the Frozen Plan which were not vested as of January 1, 2005, and (ii) to provide a select group of management or highly compensated employees described in Section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) with the opportunity to restore certain benefits which cannot be provided under the TI Employees Pension Plan from and after January 1, 2005 as a result of (a) deferral of compensation under a new deferred compensation plan established effective as of January 1, 2005  (known from and after January 1, 2009 as the TI Deferred Compensation Plan), or (b) the application of Section 401(a)(17) and/or Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  TI maintained the New Plan in accordance with the interim guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code.  In additionnew deferred compensation plan established effective as of January 1, 2005.  The benefits provided under the New Plan are unfunded with the result that the participants in the Plan are general unsecured creditors of TI.
,
for periods prior to January 1, 2009 the benefits payable under the New Plan may be deferred pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
 
TI hereby amends and restates the New Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009 (the Plan), in the form provided herein in order to remove the option of deferring payment of the benefits under this Plan, to remove the entitlement to benefits upon a Change in Control, as defined in the New Plan, to comply with the Final Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code and to name the New Plan the TI Non-Qualified Pension Plan II.  With respect to benefits or contributions lost under the TI Employees Pension Plan by reason of the operation of Section 415 of the Code, this Plan is intended to constitute an excess benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA, that is exempt from the provisions of ERISA by reason of Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA.
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, the earning of benefits and payment of those benefits under the New Plan shall be governed by the applicable interim guidance under Section 409A of the Code in effect prior to January 1, 2009, and the earning of benefits and payment of those benefits from and after January 1, 2009 shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Plan.

, the Registrant accrued restructuring charges of $121 million for these actions in the fourth quarter of 2008.
ITEM 9.01. Exhibits
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This report includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "foresees," "forecasts," "estimates" or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements in this report that describe the Company's business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or its management:
Market demand for semiconductors, particularly in key markets such as communications,
entertainment electronics and computing;  
TI's ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including its ability to utilize its manufacturing
facilities at sufficient levels to cover its fixed operating costs, in an intensely competitive and
cyclical industry;  
TI's ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing
technological environment;  
TI's ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry;  
TI's ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and obtain needed
licenses from third parties;  
Expiration of license agreements between TI and its patent licensees, and market conditions
reducing royalty payments to TI;  
Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which TI, its customers or its
suppliers operate, including security risks, health conditions, possible disruptions in transportation networks and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
Natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes in the locations in which TI, its customers
or its suppliers operate;  
Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, manufacturing equipment, third-party
manufacturing services and manufacturing technology;  
Changes in the tax rate applicable to TI as the result of changes in tax law, the jurisdictions in
which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, the outcome of tax audits and the ability to
realize deferred tax assets;  
Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers and the timing and amount of distributor
and other customer inventory adjustments;  
Customer demand that differs from our forecasts;  
The financial impact of inadequate or excess TI inventory that results from demand that differs
from projections;  
TI's ability to access its bank accounts and lines of credit or otherwise access the capital markets;  
Product liability or warranty claims, claims based on epidemic or delivery failure or recalls by TI
customers for a product containing a TI part;  
TI's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel; and  
Timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, installation of manufacturing
equipment and the ability to obtain needed third-party foundry and assembly/test subcontract
services.
For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the text under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2008. The forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 8-K are made only as of the date of this report, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99
     
DALLAS (Jan. 26, 2009)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $2.49 billion, net income of $107 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.08.
     
These financial results include restructuring charges of $0.13 per share. Without the charges, EPS would have been $0.21, considerably better than the company's mid-quarter expectations. (See reconciliation table below.)
     
TI also announced it is making reductions in employment because demand has continued to weaken with the slowing economy. Employment will be reduced 12 percent through 1800 layoffs and 1600 voluntary retirements and departures. Charges for these employment reductions will be about $300 million. Annualized savings from these reductions, plus those announced in October for the restructuring of the company's Wireless business, will be about $700 million after all reductions are complete in the third quarter of 2009.
     
"We are realigning our expenses with a global economy that continues to weaken," said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer. "By reducing expenses now, we keep TI financially strong and able to invest for future growth.
     
"Most of the reductions will come in our internal support functions and non-core product lines so that a greater percentage of the dollars we spend will go directly toward developing and supporting Analog and Embedded Processing products. We believe these are the areas that will drive TI's future growth and allow us to achieve our financial objectives.
"We are not counting on a near-term economic rebound for improvement. The actions we are taking to reduce expenses and inventory will position TI to deliver solid financial results, even in a period of prolonged economic weakness. When the economy strengthens, we'll be pleased that we focused aggressively on our core product lines."
     
4Q08 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts. Except as noted, financial results are for continuing operations. The sale of TI's former Sensors & Controls business was completed on April 27, 2006, and that business is reported as a discontinued operation.
     
TI's revenue declined 30 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 and declined 26 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008. Revenue in all segments declined in both comparisons.
     
TI's operating profit declined 95 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 and 93 percent compared with the third quarter. The declines were due to lower revenue and the associated lower gross profit in all segments, higher restructuring charges, as well as the impact of underutilized manufacturing assets. These more than offset other manufacturing cost reductions and lower operating expenses.
     
Excluding restructuring charges of $254 million, TI's operating profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter, or 12.2 percent of revenue. (See reconciliation table below.)
4Q08 segment results
The product categories in each segment are as follows:
Analog: high-performance analog (includes standard power management products, data converters, amplifiers and interface products), high-volume analog
&
logic
Embedded Processing: DSPs and microcontrollers used in catalog, communications infrastructure and automotive applications 
Wireless: DSPs and analog used in basebands, OMAP applications processors and
connectivity products for handsets 
Other: DLP products, calculators, RISC microprocessors, ASIC products, royalties
Operating profit declined in all segments because of the effect of decreased revenue and restructuring charges. Restructuring charges were as follows:
     
     
The fourth-quarter 2008 restructuring charges of $254 million included $121 million for a portion of the actions just announced, $109 million for actions announced in October to re-focus the company's Wireless business and $24 million for asset impairments related to an action announced in 2007 to shut down an older digital factory.
4Q08 additional financial information
 
Net income includes a $67 million tax benefit from the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, which was signed into law in October 2008 and was retroactive to the beginning of 2008.
Orders were $1.86 billion, down 47 percent from a year ago and down 42 percent from the prior quarter.  
Inventory was reduced by $200 million in the quarter. The company expects to continue to reduce inventory in the first quarter of 2009.  
Capital expenditures were $76 million in the quarter, a decline from $181 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $197 million in the prior quarter. The lower capital expenditures reflect restraints on spending implemented by management during this period of weaker demand and the lack of need for additional manufacturing capacity in the near term.  
The company used $386 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.3 million shares of its common stock and paid dividends of $141 million.
Year 2008 financial summary
     
TI revenue declined 10 percent compared with the prior year primarily due to a decline in Wireless segment revenue. Revenue in the Other segment also declined for the year. As the year progressed and the global economy weakened, the decline in TI revenue accelerated and broadened to the extent that all segments declined from the year-ago quarter in the final quarter of the year.
     
TI operating profit decreased 30 percent in 2008 due to the decline in revenue and the associated lower gross profit, the impact of underutilized manufacturing assets and higher restructuring charges. These more than offset a reduction in operating expenses.
     
Excluding restructuring charges of $254 million, TI's operating profit was $2.69 billion in 2008, or 21.5 percent of revenue. (See reconciliation table below.)
Year 2008 segment results
Restructuring charges negatively impacted each segment's operating profit as follows:
2008 additional financial information
 
Capital expenditures were $763 million in 2008. Depreciation was $1.02 billion.
The company used $2.12 billion to repurchase 80.2 million shares of its common stock and paid dividends of $537 million.
Outlook
For the first quarter of 2009, TI expects:
Revenue: $1.62  2.12 billion
Earnings per share: $0.11 loss - 0.03 profit
The EPS estimate includes $0.03 per share resulting from $50 million of estimated restructuring charges. EPS will continue to be impacted in the first quarter by costs associated with underutilized manufacturing assets as a result of lower demand and the company's continued reduction of inventory.
TI will update its first-quarter outlook on March 9, 2009.
For the full year of 2009, TI expects approximately the following:
R&D expense: $1.5 billion
Capital expenditures: $300 million
Depreciation: $900 million
Annual effective tax rate: 24%
Certain amounts in prior periods' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
The following describes TI's results excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Management believes this presentation provides investors additional insight into the underlying business conditions and results.

DALLAS (April 20, 2009)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced first-quarter revenue of $2.09 billion, net income of $17 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.01.
TIs revenue and earnings exceeded expectations for the quarter, but the company emphasized caution about the business climate.  Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton explained, "Demand for our products has begun to stabilize after sharp drops in the past two quarters.  Many customers have increased orders for TI products as they have begun to slow down their inventory reductions.  However, we remain sensitive to continuing weakness in the global economy, and we have yet to see signs of a broad-based recovery in our business.  In this environment, we will keep our operations flexible so that we can respond quickly to any shifts in demand, whether up or down."
Operational performance in the quarter was good, especially reduction of the companys inventory.  "We reduced our own inventory by $277 million, and at the same time worked with distributors to reduce channel inventory by $132 million.  Our inventory reductions are essentially complete, and we expect to moderately increase production levels in our factories during the second quarter," Templeton said.
"Our people are focusing on opportunities for growth in Analog and Embedded Processing.  Among highlights in the quarter were the acquisition of CICLON Semiconductor, a specialized supplier of analog chips for power management, and qualification of a new assembly/test factory.  Both improve our ability to serve customers."
1Q09 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
TIs revenue declined 36 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008 and declined 16 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.  Revenue in all segments declined in both comparisons.
TIs operating profit declined 99 percent compared with the year-ago quarter and 80 percent compared with the fourth quarter.  The decline from a year ago was due to lower revenue in all segments and the associated lower gross profit, as well as the impact of underutilized manufacturing assets and restructuring charges.  Collectively, these more than offset lower operating expenses and manufacturing cost reductions.  The decline from the prior quarter was due to lower revenue in all segments and the associated lower gross profit, as well as the impact of underutilized manufacturing assets.  These more than offset lower restructuring charges, lower operating expenses and manufacturing cost reductions.
Excluding restructuring charges of $105 million, TIs operating profit was $115 million in the first quarter, or 5.5 percent of revenue, and EPS was $0.07.  (See reconciliation table at the end of this release.)
1Q09 segment results
 
Operating profit declined in all segments from a year ago primarily because of lower revenue, as well as restructuring charges.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit declined in the Analog and Other segments due to lower revenue, although increased in Wireless due to lower restructuring charges.  
 
Restructuring charges were as follows:

Exhibit 99
 
 
DALLAS (July 20, 2009)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced second-quarter revenue of $2.46 billion, net income of $260 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.20.
After sharp inventory corrections in our markets during the prior two quarters, our revenue levels are beginning to more closely reflect end demand, said TI Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton.  As it will likely take some time before the economy strengthens, we have aligned our operations and expenses to be consistent with the weak environment.  As a result, we are seeing healthy trends in our profitability.
Analog was the biggest driver of sequential growth this quarter with all three major businesses contributing.  Of particular note, our high-volume analog & logic business is now showing early signs of progress from our efforts over the past couple of years to reinvigorate growth.
Operationally, TI performed well.  Despite low visibility at the start of the quarter, our factories were able to respond to a surge in demand resulting in 18 percent sequential growth in revenue.  At the same time, TI inventory again declined, and by working with our distributors we were able to further reduce channel inventory by about 10 percent.
Looking ahead, we expect solid sequential growth in the third quarter.  As end demand trends remain uncertain, we will keep our operations flexible so we can quickly respond to our customers needs.
In the meantime, we continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing.  In the quarter, we acquired Luminary Micro, which expanded TIs Embedded Processing portfolio by more than 140 advanced, 32-bit microcontroller products.  Many of our 2,000 field sales representatives and applications engineers already are working with these products to help customers solve a wide variety of system needs.
2Q09 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
TIs revenue declined 27 percent compared with the second quarter of 2008 and increased 18 percent compared with the first quarter of 2009.  The decline from a year ago was the result of broad-based declines across all segments.  The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to strength in TIs Analog segment as well as a seasonal increase in calculators.  Revenue was up sequentially in all segments.
TIs operating profit declined $490 million compared with the year-ago quarter and grew $333 million compared with the first quarter.  The decline from a year ago was due to lower revenue and the associated lower gross profit, as well as the negative impact of underutilized manufacturing assets and restructuring charges.  Collectively, these more than offset lower operating expenses and manufacturing cost reductions.  The increase from the prior quarter was due to higher revenue in all segments and the associated higher gross profit, combined with the positive effect of higher utilization of the companys manufacturing assets.
Excluding restructuring charges of $85 million, TIs operating profit was $428 million in the second quarter, or 17.4 percent of revenue, and EPS was $0.25.  (See reconciliation table at the end of this release.)
2Q09 segment results
 
 
 
The product categories in each segment are as follows:
 &
Analog:  high-volume analog
logic, high-performance analog (includes data converters, amplifiers and interface products) and power management
Embedded Processing:  DSPs and microcontrollers used in catalog, communications infrastructure and automotive applications
Wireless:  DSPs and analog used in basebands for handsets, OMAP applications processors and
connectivity products for wireless applications
Other:  includes DLP products, calculators, ASIC products, RISC microprocessors and royalties
Operating profit declined in all segments from a year ago primarily because of lower revenue.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit increased in the Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments primarily due to higher revenue.  Operating profit increased in the Wireless segment primarily due to the combination of higher revenue and cost reductions.
Restructuring charges were as follows:
2Q09 additional financial information

For the full year of 2009, TI expects approximately the following:

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Oct. 19, 2009)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $2.88 billion, net income of $538 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42.
 
Our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations and was led by a second consecutive quarter of 20-percent growth in Analog, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and CEO.  We are encouraged with the strong sequential increase in demand for our products over the past two quarters as our customers are winding down their inventory corrections and have begun to increase production levels in their factories.  This revenue growth, combined with our early actions to pare costs so that we would not be dependent upon an uncertain rebound in the overall economy, has resulted in solid improvements in our profitability.
Our balance sheet is strong and has allowed us to opportunistically make investments in Analog and Embedded Processing throughout this downturn that should provide returns for years to come.  For example, we are increasing our investments in manufacturing capacity to support higher levels of growth, including start-up of the worlds first facility to produce analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.  Applying advanced manufacturing technology to analog at an attractive cost will give TI an opportunity to accelerate our strategy and extend our leadership.
Although we still have much work to do, our progress has been good.
 
3Q09 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TIs revenue declined 15 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008 and increased 17 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009.  The decline from a year ago was the result of declines across all segments, particularly the Wireless segment.  The increase from the prior quarter was due to growth in all segments, particularly the Analog segment.
Despite revenue that was $507 million lower compared with the year-ago quarter, TIs operating profit grew $17 million primarily due to lower operating expenses, as well as lower manufacturing costs.  Operating profit increased $420 million compared with the second quarter primarily .  Operating profit increased from the prior quarter in all segments.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Oct. 19, 2009)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $2.88 billion, net income of $538 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42.
 
Our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations and was led by a second consecutive quarter of 20-percent growth in Analog, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and CEO.  We are encouraged with the strong sequential increase in demand for our products over the past two quarters as our customers are winding down their inventory corrections and have begun to increase production levels in their factories.  This revenue growth, combined with our early actions to pare costs so that we would not be dependent upon an uncertain rebound in the overall economy, has resulted in solid improvements in our profitability.
Our balance sheet is strong and has allowed us to opportunistically make investments in Analog and Embedded Processing throughout this downturn that should provide returns for years to come.  For example, we are increasing our investments in manufacturing capacity to support higher levels of growth, including start-up of the worlds first facility to produce analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.  Applying advanced manufacturing technology to analog at an attractive cost will give TI an opportunity to accelerate our strategy and extend our leadership.
Although we still have much work to do, our progress has been good.
 
3Q09 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TIs revenue declined 15 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008 and increased 17 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009.  The decline from a year ago was the result of declines across all segments, particularly the Wireless segment.  The increase from the prior quarter was due to growth in all segments, particularly the Analog segment.
Despite revenue that was $507 million lower compared with the year-ago quarter, TIs operating profit grew $17 million primarily due to lower operating expenses, as well as lower manufacturing costs.  Operating profit increased $420 million compared with the second quarter primarily .  Operating profit increased from the prior quarter in all segments.

TIs growth and improving performancereflect our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing.  These are large, diverse businesses that give us access to the worlds fastest-growing electronics markets, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
In the fourth quarter, demand was strong across end markets without the usual holiday slowdown.  Throughout, we believe customer and channel inventories have been lean.  With demand continuing to be solid and inventories well below historical levels, our outlook for the first quarter reflects the likelihood of sequential growth instead of the typical seasonal decline.
We continue to make investments to support customers and drive growth, including the ramp-up of the industry's first 300-millimeter analog factory in Richardson, Texas, Templeton concluded.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (April 26, 2010)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN) today announced first-quarter revenue of $3.21 billion, net income of $658 million and earnings per share of 52 cents.
TI invested in new manufacturing capacity for both wafer fabs and assembly/test facilities during the downturn in 2009.  The strategic investments weve made over the years are delivering strong growth and market share gains.  This was the fourth quarter of excellent sequential increases, with the combined revenue of our Analog and Embedded Processing businesses setting a new record level, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
Momentum continues into the second quarter as demand for our products remains strong, and we add more manufacturing capacity to support our customers.  Production output is at an all-time high, and capacity is increasing each quarter in 2010 as we add 200-millimeter equipment purchased last year and as we ramp the industrys first 300-millimeter Analog facility, from which we will start shipments in the fourth quarter.
 
 
1Q10 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
TIs operating profit increased compared with the first quarter of 2009 and the prior quarter primarily due to higher gross profit.  Higher gross profit compared with the year-ago quarter included the impact of higher revenue and the benefit associated with higher utilization of manufacturing assets.  In addition, restructuring charges were lower compared with a year ago.
 
1Q10 segment results
* All periods have been restated to reflect the transfer of a low-power wireless product line from the Analog segment to the Wireless segment.  During 2009, revenue from this product line was $68 million, and it operated at a loss of $17 million.
  
Analog:
(includes high-volume analog & logic, high-performance analog and power management products)
  
Embedded Processing:

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (July 19, 2010)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced second-quarter revenue of $3.50 billion, net income of $769 million and earnings per share of 62 cents.
Our Analog and Embedded Processing businesses turned in double-digit sequential growth, outpacing their respective markets and again confirming their ability to positively impact the financial performance of TI.  As a result, we delivered our highest-ever quarterly operating profit, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
Orders were strong in the quarter, backlog increased and we expect to grow revenue again in the third quarter.  Our steady investments in production capacity, even through last years downturn, are now allowing us to meet higher demand levels from customers and simultaneously reduce lead times, which we believe is not only in the best interest of our customers, but will also help us gain share.
As we continue our transformation to an Analog and Embedded Processing company, we believe we can significantly outgrow these markets by offering products that are optimized to the needs of our customers and by putting manufacturing capacity in place before its needed, Templeton said. 
2Q10 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
TIs operating profit increased compared with the second quarter of 2009 and the prior quarter of 2010 due to higher gross profit, which primarily reflects higher revenue.

Exhibit 99
 
TI reports financial results for 3Q10
DALLAS (Oct. 25, 2010)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $3.74 billion, net income of $859 million and earnings per share of 71 cents.
Our strong performance was driven by growth in all of our segments said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.  TIs continuing transformation to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing delivered new highs for both gross and operating margins.  Strong earnings per share demonstrate the combined impact of solid profits and our diligence to return excess capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases.
,
Demand from industrial markets was especially strong, while consumer demand cooled, impacting markets such as computing and televisions.  Across a wide array of markets, our Analog and Embedded Processing products and Wireless smartphone chips continued to gain share.  These products are broadly needed in todays electronic equipment, and our market share gains reflect the focused investments weve made in our portfolio, applications support and manufacturing capacity.
Importantly, we soon will begin initial shipments from RFAB, the worlds first 300-millimeter manufacturing facility for analog semiconductors.  In the quarter, we also purchased a 200-millimeter analog manufacturing facility in Aizu, Japan, and this month we began our first semiconductor manufacturing operations in China with the purchase of a facility in the high-tech region of Chengdu.  These purchases have been made at substantial discounts, and they support our plans to continue gaining market share over the long term.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially lower revenue reflecting a combination of seasonal patterns, continued soft demand in computing and consumer markets, and slowing growth in the industrial market, Templeton concluded.
3Q10 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TIs operating profit increased compared with the third quarter of 2009 and the prior quarter of 2010 due to higher gross profit, which reflects higher revenue.
 
3Q10 segment results
 
Note: 3Q09 has been restated to reflect the 1Q10 transfer of a low-power wireless product line from the Analog segment to the Wireless segment.  For 2009, revenue from this product line was $68 million, and it operated at a loss of $17 million.

 Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Jan. 24, 2011)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $3.53 billion, net income of $942 million and earnings per share of 78 cents.  Earnings per share included 14 cents from the combination of the gain on the sale of a product line and a tax benefit that was primarily associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
Our strong financial results for the fourth quarter reinforce our view that the inventory-driven downturn that started in the second half of 2010 is now mostly complete, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.  We used this short and shallow downturn to replenish our inventory, return product lead times to normal and ramp three new factories.  As markets start to grow again, we are well positioned with the products and manufacturing capacity that our customers need.
Templeton noted that the fourth quarter capped an important year in TIs transformation.  Strong revenue growth of 34 percent last year was led by our core businesses of Analog, Embedded Processing and the part of our Wireless segment that is focused on smartphones and tablets.  Each of these core businesses grew more than 40 percent and gained significant market share.  Success in these businesses let us again return cash to shareholders by repurchasing $2.5 billion of TI stock and paying dividends of nearly $600 million.
As we enter 2011, Analog and Embedded Processing technologies are becoming even more pervasive in the electronics of everyday life.  They are critical for the small form factors and long battery lives in tablets and smartphones, the safety and intelligence features in automobiles, and the reliability and energy-saving features of the smart grid.  With our focused R&D and expanded manufacturing capacity, were ready to deliver when and where our customers want.
4Q10 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
 
TIs operating profit included $144 million from the gain on the sale of a product line.  Net income also included a $78 million tax benefit, which was primarily associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2010.
In addition, operating profit increased from a year ago due to higher gross profit from higher revenue.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was about even as lower gross profit, which resulted from lower revenue, offset the gain on sale and lower operating expenses.
4Q10 segment results
 
 
Note:  4Q09 has been restated to reflect the 1Q10 transfer of a low-power wireless product line from the Analog segment to the Wireless segment.  For 2009, revenue from this product line was $68 million, and it operated at a loss of $17 million.
  
Analog:
(includes high-volume analog & logic, high-performance analog and power management products)
  
Embedded Processing:
(includes digital signal processor and microcontroller catalog products that are sold across a wide variety of markets, as well as application-specific products that are used in communications infrastructure and automotive electronics)
  
Wireless:
(includes
connectivity products, OMAP applications processors and baseband products)
Other:  
(includes
DLP
products, custom ASIC products, calculators and royalties, as well as products sold under transitional supply agreements associated with recently acquired factories)
Restructuring charges were as follows:

Exhibit 99
DALLAS, March 14, 2011  After a preliminary assessment, TI today said its manufacturing site in Miho, Japan, about 40 miles northwest of Tokyo, suffered substantial damage during last Fridays 8.9 magnitude earthquake.
The company estimates it will reinstate production in stages, beginning with several lines in May and returning the factory to full production in mid-July, which translates to full shipment capability in September.   This schedule could be delayed if the regions power grid is unstable or if further complications prevent the re-start of equipment.
TI is moving quickly to shift production to other fabs and so far has identified alternate manufacturing sites for about 60 percent of Mihos wafer production.  Work is underway to increase this percentage by moving the production of additional products.
Specific damage at Miho includes the following:
Recovery began in earnest over the weekend, with teams from Miho, Hiji, Dallas and Malaysia on the ground, and additional teams en route.
The Miho fab produced about 10 percent of TIs output as measured by revenue in 2010, of which more than a third was DLP and the remainder of which was Analog.  TI expects to incur previously unexpected expenses in the first and second quarters for cost of recovery.  In addition, the company expects some loss of revenue in the first quarter and more lost revenue in the second quarter.  Multiple factors will affect revenue loss, including TIs ability to move production to other factories, existing inventory from which to meet customers needs, the level of demand from customers taking delivery of products in Japan, and the ability to incrementally increase production each month at Miho.  TI expects to describe financial impact in detail at the time of its first-quarter earnings report on April 18.
TIs fab in Aizu-wakamatsu, about 150 miles north of Tokyo, also was damaged in the earthquake, though equipment there already is being re-started and full production is estimated by mid-April, assuming a stable power supply.  The companys third fab in Hiji, about 500 miles south of Tokyo, was undamaged and is currently running at normal capacity.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 4, 2011, National Semiconductor Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("National"), Texas Instruments Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("TI"), and Orion Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of TI ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Merger Sub will, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, merge with and into National, and National will be the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of TI (the "Merger"). The Board of Directors of National has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the conditions thereof, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of National common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares (i) held in treasury of National, (ii) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) owned by stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest.
The completion of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including obtaining the approval of National's stockholders and receiving certain foreign and domestic antitrust approvals (including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended).
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by National and TI. National has agreed, among other things, not to solicit alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any alternative transaction. In addition, certain covenants require each of the parties to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated. The Merger Agreement also requires National, subject to certain exceptions, to call and hold a stockholders' meeting and recommend approval of the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that (i) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, by National to accept a superior proposal or by TI upon a change in the recommendation of National's board of directors, National will owe TI a cash termination fee of $200 million and (ii) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain antitrust approvals, TI will owe National a cash termination fee of $350 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about National or TI. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in a confidential Disclosure Schedule provided by National to TI in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. This confidential Disclosure Schedule contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the
 
Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between National and TI rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about National or TI. A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by reference. The description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Exhibit 99.1
DALLAS, TEXAS and SANTA CLARA, CALIF. (April 4, 2011)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) and National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) today announced they have signed a definitive agreement under which TI will acquire National for $25 per share in an all-cash transaction of about $6.5 billion. The acquisition combines two industry leaders in analog semiconductors, each with unique strengths in delivering products to improve performance and efficiency and convert real-world signals in electronic systems. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.
"This acquisition is about strength and growth," said Rich Templeton, TI's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "National has an excellent development team, and its products combined with our own can offer customers an analog portfolio of unmatched depth and breadth. In recent years, National's management team has done an outstanding job of improving margins and streamlining expenses, which upon close will increase TI's profitability and earnings per share, excluding transaction costs. Our ability to accelerate National's growth with our much larger sales force is the foundation of our belief that we can produce strong returns on our investment. The combined sales team will be 10 times larger than National's is today, and the portfolio will be exposed to more customers in more markets."
"Our two companies complement each other very well," said Don Macleod, National's chief executive officer. "TI has much greater scale in the marketplace, with its larger portfolio of products and its large global sales force. This provides a platform to enhance National's strong and highly profitable analog capability, power management in particular, leading to meaningful growth."
Each company has unique strengths. Among them are the breadth of TI's 30,000 analog products, extensive customer reach, and industry-leading manufacturing including the world's first 300-millimeter analog factory. National brings a portfolio of 12,000 analog products, a strong position with customers in the industrial power market, and excellent customer design tools. Upon close of the transaction, National becomes part of TI's analog segment, and sales of analog semiconductors will represent almost 50 percent of TI's revenue.
The combined company also will benefit from National's manufacturing operations, located in Maine, Scotland and Malaysia, which TI will continue to operate. Each site has additional capacity to increase production. National's headquarters will remain in Santa Clara, California.
Under terms of the agreement, National stockholders will receive $25 in cash for each share of National common stock they hold at the time of closing. TI expects to fund the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including review by U.S. and international regulators and approval by National's shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in six to nine months.
 
 
The market for analog semiconductors was $42 billion in 2010. TI is the market leader with 2010 analog revenue of $6.0 billion, or 14 percent of the market. National's revenue in calendar year 2010 was about $1.6 billion, or 3 percent of the market.

Investor webcast
Today at 5:30 p.m. EDT / 4:30 p.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. PDT, TI and National will hold a live audio webcast for financial analysts and stockholders to discuss the agreement to acquire National.
The webcast will be hosted by the CEOs of each company, Rich Templeton and Don Macleod, and is accessible at www.ti.com/ir and www.national.com/invest.

Ron Slaymaker,
Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TIs plan to acquire National.  As you have likely seen, today TI and National announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement for TI to acquire National for $25 per share in cash.
Joining me today is Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and chief executive officer.  Also joining me is Don Macleod, Nationals chairman and chief executive officer.  Both have prepared comments.  And joining us for Q&A is TIs chief financial officer, Kevin March.
We will limit todays call to 1 hour.  After introductory comments by Rich and Don, we will open the lines for your questions.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on TIs or Nationals website.  This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through either companys website.  A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from managements current expectations.  We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the news release published today as well as our most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
In todays call, well address topics such as how this acquisition fits into TIs analog strategy and growth plans.  Well also address the financials associated with the transaction, including both Richs and Dons views of how each companys investors will benefit.
Rich, could you provide us with your perspectives on this acquisition?
Rich Templeton
Chairman, President and CEO, Texas Instruments
Thanks, Ron.
As you are aware, TIs strategy is to focus on Analog and Embedded Processing to drive growth and returns.  Both are large, and even though we have strong positions in each, our share is still modest.  Clearly, we have significant opportunity to grow.
Our announcement today of the acquisition of National is a key step in our strategy.  Following the close of this transaction, analog will represent almost half of TIs revenue.  Its an important milestone in our continuing progress as an aggressive analog competitor.
There are three core reasons why this acquisition is a great outcome for both companies.  First, it makes TIs analog portfolio even broader, stronger and more attractive to customers.  Second, it gives National the opportunity to grow faster.  In fact, I believe the combination of our two companies can significantly outgrow the analog market.  And third, the numbers work for both companies and our shareholders.  For TI, I expect the return on this acquisition will exceed TIs cost of capital within a few years and create shareholder value accordingly.
Let me address each of these points in more detail.
Regarding the first point, let me explain how this combination makes TI stronger and will help us serve customers better.  National has 12,000 products in its portfolio.  TI has 30,000.  In any given year, TI introduces about 500 new analog products.  With this acquisition, we add 12,000 parts all at once.  Products that are highly complementary with our own from both an end system and an individual product perspective.  Last quarter, over 45% of Nationals revenue came from industrial applications.  Our analog revenue is weighted towards communications and computing applications.  Even within the various categories of analog, there is minimal product overlap.  For example, National has a rich line-up of high-voltage power management products t hat are well-suited to industrial power applications, while our power management product offerings are more oriented toward portable devices.  National has low-speed, high-resolution data converters, while ours are high-speed, high-resolution.  There are plenty of examples like this but the bottom line is that  the combination of TI and National means we can engage with customers and in applications segments where we have no or minimal engagement today.
Nationals highly skilled analog engineering team also will make TI stronger.  Analog engineers are a critical and scarce resource and this will be an important addition to our ability to develop more solutions and drive more innovation for more customers.  Nationals design engineers will not only have access to all their current process technologies, but also to TIs broader process portfolio.
In addition, National brings other capabilities.  They have been investing in a number of new technology areas, such as automotive power management, general LED lighting and front ends for sensors, to name a few, that are now poised for growth.  Also, National has long been an innovator in packaging, and we look forward to bringing these capabilities on board.
Now let me address my second point  whyI believe we can grow the combination of our two companies significantly faster than the market.  Although National has a strong product portfolio, we believe its growth potential has yet to be met.  TI today has the worlds largest semiconductor sales force and it will become even more effective with this combination.  Important to my belief that we can significantly accelerate Nationals growth is that together our sales force will be 10 times larger than Nationals is today.  Getting Nationals great products into the hands of our combined 2500-person field sales and applications engineering force will jumpstart its growth, because more products will get to more cust omers with the acquisition than either company could sell on its own.  My expectation is that we will be able to accelerate revenue growth of National products to the same pace as our own analog revenue.  Considering the gross margins that National has achieved, the benefit to the bottom line for each additional dollar of revenue is substantial.
 
There is also an opportunity for TI to cross-sell other products, such as microcontrollers and other analog chips, into those National customers where we may not have a significant presence today.
From a manufacturing perspective, National has available capacity that is cost-efficient and offers room for growth.  Also, TI has the ability to bring on more production because of additions made in the last two years.  Together, we have a unique platform from which to produce the products our customers need in order to grow.
And finally, my third point is that the numbers work.  Ive always said we would not enter into a sizeable acquisition unless it made us a better, stronger supplier to our customers, and the numbers made sense  both near-term and long-term. The financials were a critical consideration for both sides in this transaction.  In our case, I was particularly focused on ensuring that the expected return on our invested capital would exceed our cost of capital within 3-4 years  and I fully expect it will.  This return will be driven primarily by the acceleration of revenue growth from Nationals portfolio and the resulting profit contribution.  We have every reason to believe we can generate growth in Nationals product line equal to that of TIs, and because of this gr owth, we are comfortable with the premium were paying.
The purchase price of $25.00 per share, represents a total transaction value of about $6.5B.  We expect to fund this transaction through a combination of cash from our balance sheet and debt.
From a GAAP EPS perspective, this acquisition will be accretive in the first year leaving aside costs of the transaction.  I caution you, though, that EPS accretion is a low hurdle in todays low interest rate environment with an all-cash transaction.  More important is the opportunity for revenue growth through increased product sales and the return on our invested capital.
The acquisition will be beneficial to our margins, as you would expect from a strong analog portfolio.  In 2010, Nationals gross margin compared favorably to TIs and their operating margin was similar to ours when results are adjusted for items such as restructuring and other nonrecurring events.   We have also identified cost synergies of about $100 million annualized run-rate starting one year from the close, mostly focused in corporate and support functions.
So why now  what makes this the right time to acquire National?  I believe it comes down to three reasons:  a) all three of TIs analog engines are running well and outpacing the market; b) TIs sales force has never been better at selling analog; and c) the people of National have begun an intense effort to focus on growth  they are ready to grow.  Add to this the fact that TI and National share similar cultures and strategic intents.  We both see a growing need for analog solutions and are committed to solving customers problems. We both value the talent of our employees and place the utmost importance on ethics.  And weve each been shaped by 50-plus years of semiconductor heritage  a long and rich history.
I couldnt be more pleased with this acquisition. There is a great deal of hard work in front of us, and Im ready to join the people of TI and National to build a business that has the ability to meet the analog semiconductor needs of any electronic system for any customer anywhere in the world.
Its my pleasure to now turn this over to Don for his perspective.
Don Macleod
Chairman and CEO, National Semiconductor
Thanks, Rich.
I would like to start off by addressing a question you probably all have for me  which is Why is this a good transaction for National?
Well, first of all, this transaction provides our shareholders with very compelling value.
You should all know that National was not looking to be acquired  TI approached us, and our Board decided it was appropriate to engage.
We also think that our two companies complement each other very well.
This transaction, therefore, benefits all key stakeholders.
With that, Ill turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Don.
Ill now ask the operator to open the lines for your questions.
In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question.  I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question.

Donald Macleod, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Rich. So Id like to start off by addressing a question you probably all have for me which is why in my perspective is this a good transaction for National? Well, first of all, this transaction obviously provides our shareholders with very compelling value. You should all know that National was not looking to be acquired. TI approached us and our Board of Directors decided that it was appropriate to engage.
We think that the two companies complement each other very well. National, as you know, has a strong foundation and a brand in power management, especially with our industrial customers, and National is investing in new energy efficiency application areas such as LED lighting, solar energy, and electric vehicle battery power management.
Our in-house manufacturing is industry leading, and we have a great business model with strong margins and strong earnings leverage. As youve heard from Rich, TI has a much larger platform to the market. It clearly enjoys the benefits of scale, especially with its very broad portfolio of 30,000 products and its much larger global sales force. It also has a much broader engineering base and intellectual property portfolio, and it also has in house 300-millimeter fab capabilities coming online which will prove valuable down the road for our employees.
This transaction benefits essentially all key stakeholders. First, our customers now have a much larger portfolio of products to select from. They have a combined sales team that is 10 times the size of Nationals standalone sales team now addressing their needs, and combined, as Rich said, we have about 100 years of analog and semiconductor experience, we can now cross collaborate and we can drive more innovation and in the end of the day, this is going to be for our customers benefit.
Our companies really are complementary in technologies and in the end markets and theres minimal overlap. For our employees, this provides new avenues for further career development as we combine and open up opportunities in what is now a much larger organization.
Our engineers are now provided with a larger selection of circuit design, packaging, manufacturing processes and other technology support, and they will be able to use this much larger sales force and its customer relationships to drive revenue growth. And lastly, again, for our shareholders, this really does provide Nationals shareholders with very compelling value right now and it allows for TIs shareholders a vehicle to unlock the last piece of our parcel, which is revenue growth by combining our business model with TIs acknowledged strengths and its revenue growth track record going forward.
With that, Id like to turn it back over to you, Ron. Ron?
 
Ron Slaymaker, Vice President & Head-Investor Relations
 
Thanks, Don. Ill now ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question. Operator?
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
 
Operator:  [Operator Instructions] Well take our first question today from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just the first one, you guys have talked for a long time about the potential to achieve well above the market growth level on your own. Why is this all of a sudden the time to decide that you were better off trying to buy some of that growth rather than trying to stick with it on your own?
<Q  Stacy Rasgon  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.>:
Rich?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, Stacy, I think the answer is yes, and what I mean by that is, in some ways youve looked over the past eight quarters, I think Rons team provides the update of how weve grown versus the market, with the total core businesses especially analog and weve been outgrowing by the 2X metric weve referred to. So weve got all three of our analog businesses, the power business, HVAL and HPA growing above market and what we see very simply is a unique opportunity to add a fourth strong business to the portfolio right now. So this is not about not growing organically. Its about keeping that organic growth high and then bringing high organic growth t o the National portfolio.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Do you have a follow on, Stacy?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
I do, yeah. Just around I guess the balance sheet, so youre levering up here. You guys have always had a pristine balance sheet. This makes it maybe a little bit of a bigger bet. Can you give us some feeling for how much debt you actually feel like you need to raise? How much cash you might keep on the books? And what does this actually mean for the trajectory of the share buyback that you announced a couple of months ago?
<Q  Stacy Rasgon  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.>:
Kevin, do you want to take that one?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Sure. Stacy, we last quarter had a little less than $3.1 billion on our balance sheet and Nationals most recent quarter had about $900 million, so combined we have quite a bit of cash available. Clearly well keep a fair amount of that for our operating needs. As we look forward its going to be somewhat a function of the timing of when this closes because we can clearly continue to accumulate cash as we go through the year. As you well know, first quarter tends to be our lowest cash accumulation quarter and it builds up throughout the year. So I would estimate right now that we would be looking at somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion of total borrowing when we close o n this transaction.
<A  Kevin March  Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President>:
Stacey, thank you for your questions lets move to the next caller please.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Well take our next question from John Barton with Cowen and Company.
Thanks, Rich. Could you provide your thoughts on any regulatory hurdles you might encounter, please?
<Q  John Barton  Cowen & Co.>:
Yeah, John, obviously weve looked at that pretty closely, and the belief is you can look at it in some ways a very fragmented market. Our share is at 14% in total as a company, Nationals is at about three. But really the story of analog is when you start drilling down into the finer compartments and product areas, you end up finding competitive offerings in many of these spaces. So with the time weve spent on that, thats the confidence we have that it can move through regulatory approval.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Did you have a follow on, John?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, please. Rich, you touched on product breadth, right, 12,000 products, 30,000 products, the rate of product introduction. How much redundant R&D do you think there is between the two companies that youll be able to get rid of and actually further accelerate that product introduction, be it process, be it packaging, the things that can be spread across the bigger organization?
<Q  John Barton  Cowen & Co.>:
Yeah, John, the simple answer and we had a chance to chat with employees just a few minutes ago is the intent is really, none. And what I mean by that is we look at a talented R&D team out here, talented package development people. Theyve got their versions of some high voltage and different mixed signal processes and this is about how you get these teams growing faster, not reducing R&D.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So we think what will most likely happen is that the quality of the projects or the quality of the opportunities that the National team has will continue to grow. Wed love to be investing more over time and the real secret to this is just getting highly accelerated revenue on top of whats already being invested, so thats where the focus will be.
All right. Thank you, John. Lets move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And well take our next question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Yes. Thank you and congratulations to both of you on this announcement. My question is on management team. Can you talk a little bit about how the new management team is going to look like?
<Q  Tore Svanberg  Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.>:
Yeah, Tore. If you look at the structure and you know with our Analog segment today, we have three businesses or three main businesses inside of that and the intention is very simply that we will add a fourth business. Its a great team of people operating out here and around the world and we want to keep that operating intact. And so the business entity to speak will be a fourth unit. Gregg Lowe who runs Analog for us is going to be spending really time running that fourth business so he can get close and learn everybody in addition to maintaining his ongoing role for the total Analog segment.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Youll watch us as part of that move the  connect the line for the manufacturing sites, so the two wafer fabs, the assembly/test operation into our manufacturing operation to get the combined strength in being together on that front. Well have a single face to the customer from a sales force point of view, because we think that is a vital area to be able to get more attention on the products, so well be bringing the sales forces together and then we will be going through some combinations, especially on the G&A or corporate function side to be able to get some efficiencies on that, but that is a much smaller piece.
Did you have a follow-on, Tore?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, just on manufacturing. So my understanding is that both on the front-end and on the back-end youre going to be keeping everything, I shouldnt expect any potential cost savings there?
<Q  Tore Svanberg  Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.>:
That is correct. And I think not only are we going to be keeping the operations that are there, but I believe Don and Lewis have talked on their calls in the past, the wafer fabs have been running, I think in the 60s  60% range, Don?
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Yeah. Thats good.
<A  Donald Macleod  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
60% range on utilization, so boy, this is a magical thing in our business when you can get more sales across those same fixed costs, good things happen and thats where our energy will be focused.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Thank you, Tore. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Well take our next question from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Yeah, thank you. Well, my first question is on the deal cost. I was just curious; can you walk through how you came up with the price itself? I mean, the deal cost was 6.5 billion. It looks like its like 2X the cumulative free cash flow National has generated over the last 13 years? Thank you.
<Q  Shawn Webster  Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.>:
Yeah, if you take a look at the transaction valuations and we are, we believe that in some ways people will look at the premium or the calculation or do even the calculation that you just did looking backward, but what we studied very, very closely was we took a look at the revenue, we took a look at the revenue growth that we believe could be achieved, we looked at things like going back even just two years on the revenue levels that National has been achieving, and the fact is we think thats a great indication of the capability of the analog product portfolio thats out here, and the fact is portfolios dont change that fast.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So we took those calculations of what we felt we could drive with growth. We took a look over time what we could achieve and then it was very simply finding the  it was a fair value, but one that we think addresses really the needs of both shareholders on that particular front.
Do you have a follow on, Shawn?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, thanks. Just on the overall consolidation process, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts. Do you expect to see more of this in the analog industry, was this is a competitive bidding process? Thank you.
<Q  Shawn Webster  Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.>:
Shawn, youve heard me comment before in many different environments that I dont think in the tech field, especially the analog or the chip business where innovation continues to be a pretty important factor, that there is necessarily some force of consolidation. And so the thought process thats behind this is not one of consolidation, but one of really just opportunity to grow faster and a great way to put $6.5 billion to work earning pretty good rates of return. So thats  that was the sense we had.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Thank you, Shawn. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.
Hey, guys, just based on my math, the deal looks like its four to five times accretive to my earnings in 2011. Would you agree with this? And as a follow-up, is there potential to generate additional cost synergies if the revenue growth, Rich, that you talked about does not materialize?
<Q  Romit Shah  Nomura Securities International, Inc.>:
Okay, Kevin, do you want to take a shot at that?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Sure, Romit, I wont go so far as to predict the actual number of pennies of EPS accretion, but I would say that we do expect it to be accretive immediately, when you exclude the actual transaction deal cost. And thats on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis of course more amortization could run other things going on and it will be even more so.
<A  Kevin March  Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President>:
And there was a second part of that question?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, I would say on the question of cost synergy versus growth, guys youve watched us. Weve had pointed analyst meetings even several years ago when it came to our HVAL business wasnt growing at the rate we wanted it to and the focus is how do you get it growing well? And I think in many ways, thats the part thats exciting about this. Dons team is well into the beginning of that journey and I think were providing even more tools now with the expanded sales force to try to accelerate that even faster.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Rich...
<Q  Romit Shah  Nomura Securities International, Inc.>:
Thank you, Romit, and well move to the next caller, please?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And well take our next question from Chris Danely with JP Morgan.
Thanks, guys and congrats on the deal. I guess first just a question for Rich. I mean, it seems as though over the last few years, some of your growth has come at the expense of National, so could you just take us through the puts and the takes as to why not just continue to take share from National versus buying them now and did you guys look at any other companies involved in this and was National sort of the best out there?
<Q  Chris Danely  JPMorgan Securities LLC>:
Chris, I think the easy way to look at that is if you take a look at the growth, the share gain that our Analog businesses have collectively added over the past couple of years, it is significant but its also a case that while some of that may have come from the National product line, when you take a look at the breadth of competitors and the markets, be it signal chain or the mixed signal side which the National portfolio really doesnt address, thats where we see great opportunities to put the combined growth on top.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
My confidence is that Ive just watched in this business too long that analog and particularly analog catalog portfolios take a long time to build and I think theres a lot of inherent value inside of them and I think weve got a chance with the changes that have begun here but that we can accelerate to really push growth against a lot of other power competitors that are out in the world.
Okay, and Operator, or Romit, I realize I didnt give you your follow-up question so if you will queue back in and Billie if you can work with the Operator to get Romit back up to the top. Do you have a follow on, Chris?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, thank you. So it sounds like theres a lot of synergies between TI and National. Do you guys have an estimate of how much overlap there is in terms of the product lines?
<Q  Chris Danely  JPMorgan Securities LLC>:
Yeah, Chris, its an interesting one and it was one where we spent a lot of time, Don and I and Greg Lowe and the team. You can take a very simple description. For example, switch mode power supplies and weve got strong offerings with a product family called SWIFT. National has a strong offering with I think its the Simple Switcher business and so at a high level, you can say boy, thats an overlap. Youre both in switch mode power supplies, but when you take the time and put it on a graph and you look at output voltages versus drive, you all of a sudden start seeing a little bit of our heritage difference. So youll see with the National family, higher voltages indicative of industrial, telecommunications type power supply applications. You look at our family of SWIFT you see it more driven by mobile or portable devices from that perspective. So thats where when you start sorting down through that, you really get pretty intrigued by what the complementary nature is and weve got examples of that on the data converter lines. You can look at it at in amplifiers. Theyve got a strong Class A, B offering and weve got a stronger Class D offering so we really have studied that pretty closely.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Chris, thank you and well move to next caller?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And we have Romit Shah back.
Hes back. Go ahead, Romit.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Hi, thanks guys. Rich I just want to ask, you guys have been a longstanding player in the analog market and youve been very competitive there, yet your market share has been in the mid-teens and just curious why is it so tough to gain share in this market and just having National accelerate your trajectory?
<Q  Romit Shah  Nomura Securities International, Inc.>:
Romit, I might take a little bit of exception if you get the  if you take the time back and look over the longer term, and youll actually see pretty steady five and six year process of us building up. In 2010, I think most consensus is that number probably moved into the 14% range. We clearly had even during that climb, for example, HVAL not performing for a couple of years but now really dating back to 2009, growing and supporting our growth strongly. So I think weve got the ability to continue with the organic growth that Ive commented on already.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
What today is about is not was that good or was that good enough. But we think we have some assets of sales force that covers the world better than any other sales forces, some manufacturing, some technology scale that we can really bring to bear with the National team and that product portfolio and their skilled folks. And then add even more growth on top of that, so its  per one of the earlier questions, its not a trade-off of doing one versus the other.
Great. Thank you, Romit, for coming back. And operator, well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And we will move on to Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
Thank you. Rich, given your growth target that youve communicated to us in the past, in the 2x the analog growth rate, combined with National, do you think you can sustain that growth given the large size of the business now? And also, if you look out to the different end markets, where do you see the biggest growth potential given your combination with National today?
<Q  Srini Pajjuri  Credit Agricole Securities (USA), Inc.>:
So on the question of the 2x growth goal and let me just remind for other callers that may not have heard it or remember what that means exactly. What weve really said is whatever assumption you have for the semiconductor market over a three to five year basis, if you believe thats an 8% overall market, the definition of growing 2x the market is that you would be eight percentage points higher or 16% annually. If you felt the market was smaller, it would be the same type of math.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So, we have spent time with the National team where very clearly the goal is to quickly get the National portfolio growing at that same rate or to that same objective that we have for the TI team and as I believe you know, weve been able to turn that growth in for the past couple years with the TI analog businesses. So weve been clear about that. Weve got a lot of work to go do, but were encouraged by that opportunity.
In terms of end markets, you know, Im careful about narrowing that down, because I think with the skills that weve got across the product portfolio, this is a product portfolio that touches power management, touches amplifiers, some positions in converters, and I think its going to give us an opportunity, probably the most unique one as I commented in the prepared remarks is National is stronger in industrial and thats going to get us into customers that were going to take longer, it was going to take five years for us to get into and build relationships. We can accelerate with this acquisition. So industrial is probably the most standout one, but in general we see opportunities to engage across the market.
Srini, do you have a follow-up?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, and then obviously, half of your business is analog and as the baseband business declines over the next few years, as a percent of sales analog will continue to increase. Im just curious, Rich, where does OMAP and connectivity fit into this whole you know, Analog and Embedded Processing. Whats the strategy for that business longer term? Thank you.
<Q  Srini Pajjuri  Credit Agricole Securities (USA), Inc.>:
You know, the strategy and weve talked about it before is great growth opportunities are a nice thing to have, and if you look inside the application process or the OMAP business and the connectivity business, I think in many ways, and weve probably surprised the outside world with just how fast Greg Delagi and Remi and Haviv and that team have grown.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Obviously, smartphones and tablets are all the craze and were excited about the customers were dealing with. But we also see the ability to diversify that business, or fan that business out and weve got people and resources off working at growing it into additional markets and additional market spaces. So I think its going to be a great business to be driving growth and driving earnings for TI in addition to what were doing on the analog front.
Thanks, Srini. And well move to the next caller?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Your next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche, are you there?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, I am. Thank you very much. So let me just ask about the manufacturing strategy. You know, so you have some assets you bought from memory companies which you are moving to analog and then you have your own analog processes and also you now add in Nationals process. Is there going to be a way to kind of harmonize this or are you going to just run these processes and if so, are there any synergies from a manufacturing standpoint that you could have? Im just trying to see how to quantify any additional synergies to the $100 million annualized you are getting from corporate and support function?
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
Yeah, you know, Uche my advice on that is the word harmonize near a technical population is usually a bad thing, okay. It usually means everybody compromises for a lesser output. So what we are so excited about with what we have with the National acquisition is that not only do you have the strong product portfolio but youve got manufacturing assets that have tremendous head room to grow. We talked about the 60% utilization.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So the fall through on the National front can be very strong on that. What we will literally be doing, if you spent time and would spend time with the development teams once this gets closed is we have told folks very simply, every process that you design on or every package technology that you use today as a National design engineer, you have it tomorrow. You have it in a year and any extensions that youre planning on the process team making, youve got those.
Oh, by the way, if theres things over in the TI portfolio that you dont have and it lets you put out a great product, youve now got access to that as well, so we dont have to move processes between fabs. We dont have to re-qual part numbers for customers, all of which is highly inefficient and wastes time so the synergy that will come from that is really just comes back to how fast we can grow the revenue.
Do you have a follow on, Uche?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, I do. So the closing time is six to nine months. Outside of regulatory concerns, are there any other reasons why we have a nine month closing period which in the context of some of these deals is quite a long one, and in terms of market share, if and when this deal closes, what do you think will be the combined market share of the two companies, because you used to give us your own market share somewhere in the 17%, 18% range. Im not quite sure how it kind of adds up now with National.
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
Thats a multi-part question, so multi-choice, so take whichever one you want.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Theyre two short questions.
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
So, on timing and if Kevin wants to add, he certainly can, but in general, the regulatory approval is why weve got a six to nine month window that weve described for anticipated closing. If we can do it sooner, we certainly will but that would be the longest item anticipated on that front, and then on the shares themselves, I think most public market analysts would put TI in the 14 and change range. I think National is at the three and change, so its going to be somewhere between 17 and 18 if you use, again, industry calculations and our Analog segment revenue and the National Semiconductor number.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
I think you are one of those analysts, Uche, we should be asking you. Kevin do you have anything to add?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, Id just say on the length of the closing the reason that we have framed it as six to nine months is its not just U.S. and European regulatory authorities but its authorities in an assortment of other countries and we think well be probably going through 10 or more different countries for our regulatory authority on this and frankly some of them its not entirely clear how long it will take and so thats why we ranged six to nine months on that.
<A  Kevin March  Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President>:
Okay. Thanks, Kevin. And thank you, Uche, well move to our next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Our next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.
Hi guys. Congratulations on the deal. My main question is how much of Nationals output are you going to be moving into 300-millimeter fabs?
<Q  Craig Berger  FBR Capital Markets>:
So Craig, the simple one so we can cover it clearly and this is on behalf of all analysts plus any employees that are listening as well is with the utilization levels that are inside of National today, our intent would be to continue to grow and fill those factories that are there. Now, if we have people inside of National that want to use a particular process that were qualifying and running in 300-millimeter or it makes sense for a new product that theyre releasing, could they put new products into that fab for the long term? Absolutely. Weve talked about that being one of the really great benefits is in the long term, that becomes an asset that the team out here can take advantage of, but there will be no fab shifting or near term fab shifting plan.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
And Craig, I think Ill note that we did that even with our own products. When we brought up RFAB we talked about it was for growth. It wasnt for the purpose of cost reduction and thats the way were executing it. Do you have a follow on, Craig?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah. Can you just remind us how much 300-millimeter capacity you have, how much youre utilizing and then if you can, make any comments on supply chain over in Japan, as it relates to that, great, if not, we can skip it.
<Q  Craig Berger  FBR Capital Markets>:
Yeah, Craig, and Ron will have to clarify. We talked Renner with the tooling that we had in it was capable basically to be able to run $2 billion of annual revenue, and as you know and Ill remind all those that are on the call, qualified October of 10, so first production basically in fourth quarter calendar 10 and we will ramp that as a function of demand.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Obviously, with some of the things  to the second part of the question  that are going on in Japan, well put some of those mask sets that were running or are running over in the Miho facility in Japan just so weve got customers double tooled and supported as the Miho facility comes up accordingly.
So on the Japan side; I think we put a release out. I forget, Monday, Tuesday a week ago, and the fact is the team is really  the guys have done a superb job going around the clock. Theyve got the clean room recertified and the plan is to have that mini line or the first production moving in mid-April and the folks are going around the schedule to do that and we feel pretty good.
Any additional update on that Craig, well try to provide with our earnings in a couple weeks. Okay, Craig thanks for your questions. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And well go now to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Hi, guys. Congrats from me as well. First question on the growth side of things, Rich you talked about getting Nationals revenue growth up to matching TIs. You also talked about how it takes such a long time to kind of move the needle in the analog space in both directions. When do you expect Nationals growth rate to match TIs and in sort of what timing is built into that positive ROI of three to four years that you mentioned?
<Q  Ross Seymore  Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.>:
Yeah. Ross, Im going to  Im not going to give a specific answer just so we can limit the amount of fun Ron has in trying to answer that over the next couple of years. But you can imagine that we have set some objectives for the team and weve talked to them about that.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Weve got to get the acquisition closed to put that in place but you can probably guess that we would model a step in 12 and then really when you get further out, get it up to the full rate, but its not  that target is not a date were going to put out in front of everybody.
If I can, just to keep it more, kind of general, is the assumption that that growth rate matches yours implicit within your positive return assumption that you talked about in your press release and in your prepared comments?
<Q  Ross Seymore  Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.>:
Yes, Ross. If I wasnt clear on that, thats absolutely the case. The basis or the economics that are required to drive the payback on this thing is about achieving the types of goals that we talked about.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Okay. Thank you, Ross. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Well go now to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Great, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Really just one question from me. Rich, over the years whenever youve been asked about acquisitions one of the things you always highlighted is how important the culture of the company that youre acquiring is and a lot of that was based on your experience with Burr-Brown and Unitrode over the years. How do you think culturally these two organizations will come together given how much youve emphasized that issue in the past?
<Q  James Covello  Goldman Sachs & Co.>:
Yeah. This is one where every day I spend on this, the more I got to know Don and meet some of the folks out here, you feel better and better. And as we just talked with an employee large, all hands on deck meeting, at the heart, weve got passion of innovation. Weve got passion in the importance of ethics and how you operate. Were global companies. We love the analog business. We love coming up with new circuits, new process, new package. These are all things that are very common.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
As Don commented in his remarks, weve got over 100 years of experience in analog between the companies National being really the original analog company, TI with the invention of the integrated circuit. So I think were going to find the things that are common very, very high, and so its exciting to see it and I think its going to be fun to turn the energy loose.
Okay. Jim, thank you. And well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Yeah, thank you and congratulations on the deal. I guess, the last time that you guys did an acquisition like this was Burr-Brown and Unitrode. And Id assume that you guys had some observations from how you integrated those acquisitions and apply it to this. And specifically I remember at the time that it took a while to get real synergies between those groups and TI. And maybe you could talk about that and what you intend to do differently this time.
<Q  Chris Caso  Susquehanna Financial Group LLP>:
Yeah, Chris, in some ways, theres a shorter list of us that remember the time, but remember at the time of those acquisitions, we also then went through a modest decline from the tech bubble in 2001 and 2002. So there was a few other things happening out in the marketplace. I think there was also a difference at that time that we were building as a company to learn what did analog really mean. And that was all about and some of you will recall that we talked way back in that timeframe of how do you attach analog to DSP so that we could get salespeople to understand how to sell accordingly?
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So whats so dramatically different 10 years later is that weve got three analog businesses growing fast and weve got a sales force that has simply never been better at selling analog. If you spend time with them, they know how to hunt for literally every socket on the board. Weve got training programs in place where you dont train on specific products, you train on how do you go across and take out not just power, but look for clocks and look at converters and what about the microcontroller and really have people institutionalizing that skill.
So I think the speed at which we can actually bring help to the National growth acceleration is actually quite a bit higher than where we were with the acquisitions of Burr-Brown and Unitrode.
And I believe, Rich, is it not true that Gregg Lowe was very closely involved in the integration of Burr-Brown?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Gregg had the opportunity to learn firsthand. So he will bring some of those learnings to this one as well, Im sure.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Do you have a follow on, Chris?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Sure. And it was actually, Gregg, whose told a lot of those stories on the road so thats why I knew to ask the question. But just as a follow-up, and I guess with respect to the distribution network, perhaps you could talk to the differences in the distribution network between TI and National. And I suppose theres a considerable amount of overlap there. What are the tasks you need to do on that in the days to come?
<Q  Chris Caso  Susquehanna Financial Group LLP>:
Yeah, that will just be one that we will have to take a look and you really have to do that globally and really look market  regional area-by-area of what makes best sense, so I think the team comes into it with the mind open and it really is a case of what drives best growth and so we dont try to have any more restrictions than that right now.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Okay. Thank you, Chris. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Hi, everybody. Quick question on the communications side. Two aspects here on the infrastructure where both TI and National have a decent exposure, the overlap there, and then on the wireless handset side, the analog portion for TI versus the connectivity OMAP, whats TIs analog exposure on handsets?
<Q  Brendan Furlong  Miller Tabak & Co. LLC>:
The infrastructure side, I want to be careful drilling deep on that because I have not seen a break out in base station itself from an analog portfolio. Weve obviously got quite a bit from the power growing on the signal chain side. Don, I dont know if you have anything to add or can expand on that?
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Well, this is one of the areas where National Semiconductor uses its proprietary in-house process technology. For example, we have clocking circuits using our silicon germanium capability and our BiCMOS capability. So what we do tends to be differentiated from what TI does because we have different processes, and this is a good example of where our circuits and TIs circuits together actually make a much more complete solution at the system level for wireless base stations in this particular example.
<A  Donald Macleod  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Likewise, Rich talked about power management and some of those areas where we have some of the very high voltage power solutions that go into the bricks, the power supplies for these base stations our complementary, high voltage power management along with TIs circuits, including, by the way, the FET circuits, really complements it very well to provide again a complete system level solution, so we fit very well together there, even if both of us do focus on the overall market.
Any comment from the handset side?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, I wasnt sure of the exact question of total content in handsets, so I want to be careful just trying to throw a number out on that.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Just maybe talk a little bit about where TI plays in the handset on the analog side?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, if you just look at handset content and Im going to leave out baseband because thats how we give an update on that as that business ramps down, you will find across our analog portfolio a variety of spaces from highly integrated mixed signal power management ICs, also applications with amplifiers or backlit LED and different devices like that.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
When you then go into the, quote, wireless business thats been talked about and then you start getting into the application processor and connectivity side, so think wireless LAN, think Bluetooth, think GPS, and thats really a combination of smartphone and tablet with some heritage medium performance voice-only handset as well.
Okay, Brendan, did you have a follow-on?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
I guess my follow-on would be, National is running a pretty lean business model currently, and youre talking about $100 million in synergies a year, even from the closing. Im just curious if you give us kind of a road map on where you think youre going to get the $100 million from when National is running pretty tight already?
<Q  Brendan Furlong  Miller Tabak & Co. LLC>:
Yeah, I think this is one if you take a look at it, theres the obvious just at the higher level of corporate functions when things come together on that front but there are some other areas as we looked just throughout the world in terms of where we have things and where were doing things. Kevin, do you want to add any color? I know youve spent the most amount of time around that.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Yeah, I think its clearly what you said there, Rich is theres a lot of corporate and support functions that over the course of the integration process will be able to be streamlined and thats really the largest opportunity. For example, the corporate staff function in both companies and thats, that doesnt necessarily have to scale with the size of the combination. The same is true for procurement activities and IT activities and a host of other sort of things that go on in those sort of support functions that in fact when you do the math, its not that difficult to be able to see $100 million of annual synergies by the end of the first year.
<A  Kevin March  Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President>:
Okay, thank you, Brendan. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  The next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen, are you there?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Please check your mute button. Well check his line and move on.
Okay, thank you.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Move on to Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
Yes, hi. Rich, I guess first question for you, one of the things you talked about was the benefit of scale that you bring to Nationals portfolio. I guess my question was there are other companies the size of National who have actually grown faster, so what gives you the conviction that scale is what was lacking from Nationals ability to grow at its full potential so far?
<Q  Sumit Dhanda  Citadel Securities>:
So Sumit, I would make a couple of things, a couple of points on that. First is in the world of Analog, there is no replacement for great products and great product development and unique features, so scale does matter but it matters as part of the portfolio, not scale instead of great products and great innovation on that particular front.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
The other thing is, I think its been reasonably well discussed that Don and his team have been working on swinging the focus from a lot of the great margin improvement work that was done really up through and probably including 2008 and getting the strong focus on the growth side, so the view we have and the reason that weve got the confidence to be able to put these things together and do well is youve got momentum already moving in that direction so we will simply be able to do some really in some ways classic stuff. Get out to customers, make sure youve got coverage of boards, being on AVLs, or Approved Vendor Lists, really making sure youre just very thoroughly engaged in the sales channel, and those are things where I think we can bring the scale of the sales force very quickly to bear and we re going to challenge our teams to do that accordingly.
Do you have a follow on Sumit?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yes, a quick follow on. The other thing that you mentioned, Rich, was that theres no  or the fact that you have a common computing exposure within analog, National and industrial exposure. I understand the vertical synergy so to speak, but why not look at other companies out there which offer both the vertical synergy as well as maybe a product synergy, data converter is an area where youve not really established as dominant a market position, so walk us through why you thought National was the best fit from that perspective?
<Q  Sumit Dhanda  Citadel Securities>:
Youve heard us talk and this is something I had a chance today with the team even being out here beyond just Don and I talking. And if you take a look at the power opportunity and you think about the demands and the impact that power management skills have in system performance and system applications, this has been an area of great growth for us. And we think it can be an area of tremendous growth going forward because shares are still pretty low in that market and there is a lot of room to innovate around the whole power management side.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Youve watched us and Don actually touched on it on the infrastructure question. A couple of years ago, we added the FET line with an acquisition and continuing to move across that power chain from the power management, receivers into the power stages themselves, these are great complementary areas that are going to grow rapidly. So that was where when we stared at that type of opportunity, we said this really makes sense.
Theres also another very key feature in this, and that is while the headline of what the premium is going to look like is very high, if you take a look at the actual cost or the value that we paid or will be paying for National on a cap per revenue or price to revenue, you actually find it sitting at I think its about 4.1 with the announced price. If you take a look at those top three standalone analog companies that you could think about out in the marketplace, so Analog Devices or Maxim or LTC, you will actually find the average price to sales at 4.2.
So you end up at a market price even with a pretty significant premium and folks, that is an important element in order to be able to drive the returns on invested capital that weve been able to calculate and gives us the confidence on this deal. So thats a little bit of insight into some of the thinking and some of the background of why we think this makes sense.
Okay, Sumit. Thank you. Well move to the next caller.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thanks for taking my question. Rich, Im curious. How are you going to make sure that you dont lose momentum internally during the couple of quarters it could take for the deal to close?
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
If you take a look at the question internally, I assume that is both here at National as well as at TI?
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Yes.
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
You know, its pretty simple, youve got to keep running the places and we were very clear even at the employee meeting. Until close, these are competitors and were going to compete tomorrow like we did yesterday and were going to be very focused and I think the great news is that you know the amount of energy that weve had on growth inside of TI, and I know Don and his team have had a similar amount of growth focus at this side. So I think thats going to be the challenge for the management teams, but people have got those tasks well lined out.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
Did you have a follow on, Vivek?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Yeah, just a clarification. Is there a breakup fee associated with the deal and do you expect any other bidders to emerge?
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
Kevin, would you like to address that?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Sure, there is a breakup fee, as you would normally see in a deal like this. In fact, the fee is $200 million. Theres also a reverse breakup fee should it be some issue at the end of about $350 million.
<A  Kevin March  Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President>:
Thank you, Vivek, and operator, I think we have time for one additional caller to ask questions.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
Operator:  Okay. And well take that last question from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research.
Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in there. This is Ryan Cram, Im actually filling in for Ed Snyder. My question is really surrounding fab utilization and you guys have kind of touched on this a little bit earlier in the call, but on National Semis last conference call, they indicated fab utilization of about 58%, down from 68% from the previous quarter and I know Texas Instrument has also talked about some head room in their capacity. How does this translate near term to margins? Do you see that being dilutive or accretive and how will you guys manage that going forward?
<Q  Ryan Cram  Charter Equity Research>:
Let me comment on the TI front because I think we touched on this, Ron and Kevin did pretty hard back in the January call, and that is we have gone out in the past whatever it is, 18 months, weve added the three wafer fabs, the ramp up of Renner, the 300-millimeter site, the addition of the Japan fab and the acquisition in China and where we are absolutely thrilled guys is because of the prices that were able to acquire them at, our fourth quarter P&L was literally an all-in cost, so youve got full depreciation, operating costs, everything running through that.
<A  Richard Templeton  Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>:
So, unlike the old days when youre out putting in a new CMOS fab at $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion and youve got that big depreciation spike rolling through, its all in there now, so this is not about us worrying about having underutilization at TI. We view that as the opposite and that is weve got great growth head room that very few other companies have in the world right now, and I think this is really going to be critical.
You see competitors in the analog business operating wafer fabs in the 90% utilization level and thats called full in our business and when youre full you cant grow, and so this is a really great position to be, is great products and a lot of head room to be able to grow both with the comments I gave on TI, but also as Lewis and Don have indicated, utilizations in the 60% range give us that same chance out here.
Do you have a follow on, Ryan?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Vice President & Head-Investor Relations>:
No, that answers my question. I appreciate your time.
<Q  Ryan Cram  Charter Equity Research>:
 
 
Ron Slaymaker, Vice President & Head-Investor Relations
 
Okay, thank you. So before we end the call, Ill remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you and good evening.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference. We appreciate your participation.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (April 18, 2011)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced first-quarter revenue of $3.39 billion, net income of $666 million and earnings per share of 55 cents.
2011 started strong, with customer demand in January and February tracking our expectations for a first quarter of above-seasonal growth, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.  But the Japan earthquake thats taken such a heartbreaking human toll in the country also disrupted local demand starting in mid-March and impaired operations at two of our factories there.  This impact and substantially weaker demand for Wireless baseband chips resulted in revenue that was below the middle of our expected range.  The lower revenue combined with expenses resulting from the earthquake affected earnings per share.  New orders, however, were strong through the quarter, indicative of the underlying strength in our markets.
Recovery of our operations in Japan is progressing well.  One of our factories will soon be resuming full production, and the other has restarted initial processing of wafers and is on schedule for full loadings in mid-July.  Nonetheless, many of our Japanese customers remain in the early stages of reopening their own factories, and we and our customers face potential supply chain disruptions.  We expect growth in the second quarter, though it will be pressured by the situation in Japan.  Provided consumer and enterprise demand remain strong, we expect a good second half of the year.
 
1Q11 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TIs operating profit was negatively impacted by about $30 million for costs resulting from the earthquake.  These costs were recorded in the companys Other segment.  TIs earnings per share were negatively impacted by about 2 cents by these costs.
Operating profit declined from a year ago due to higher operating expenses.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was lower primarily due to a $144 million gain on the sale of a product line in the prior quarter and lower gross profit, which resulted from lower revenue.
Net income in the prior quarter also included a $78 million tax benefit, which was primarily associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2010.
 
1Q11 segment results
 
  
Analog:
(includes high-volume analog & logic, high-performance analog and power management products)
  
Embedded Processing:
(includes digital signal processor and microcontroller catalog products that are sold across a wide variety of markets, as well as application-specific products that are used in communications infrastructure and automotive electronics)
  
Wireless:
(includes
connectivity products, OMAP applications processors and baseband products)
Other:  
(includes
DLP
products, custom ASIC products, calculators and royalties, as well as products sold under transitional supply agreements associated with recently acquired factories)
 
1Q11 additional financial information
Outlook
For the second quarter of 2011, TI expects:
This estimate includes a negative impact of about 5 cents for costs resulting from the earthquake and its aftermath in Japan.
TI will update its second-quarter outlook on June 8, 2011.
For the full year of 2011, TI expects approximately the following:
 
 
 
 
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) on which we pay dividend equivalents is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded from earnings per common share was $10 million, $8 million and $14 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2011, March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
National Semiconductor Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Semiconductor Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended May 30, 2010.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Operations
We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products, most of which are analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Our goal is to be the premier provider of high-performance energy-efficient analog and mixed-signal solutions. These solutions are marketed under our PowerWise brand. Energy-efficiency is our overarching theme, and our PowerWise products enable systems that consume less power, extend battery life and generate less heat. Our leading-edge products include power management circuits and sub-systems, audio and operational amplifiers, communication interface products and data conversion solutions.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include National Semiconductor Corporation and our majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of May and for our fiscal year ended May 30, 2010, we had a 52-week year. For our fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, we had a 53-week year. Operating results for the additional week in fiscal 2009 were considered immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2009. Our fiscal year ended May 25, 2008 was a 52-week year.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment, provided we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement typically in the form of a purchase order, title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. We record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment. Approximately 64 percent of our semiconductor product sales were made to distributors in fiscal 2010, which includes approximately 9 percent of sales made through dairitens in Japan under local business practices. This compares to approximately 53 percent in fiscal 2009 and approximately 54 percent in fiscal 2008, which includes sales made through dairitens in Japan of approximately 8 percent in fiscal 2009 and 11 percent in fiscal 2008. We have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs, including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume, price protection for inventory and scrap allowances.
In line with industry practices, we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and, under specific conditions, we repurchase products that we have discontinued. In general, distributors do not have the right to return product, except under customary warranty provisions. The programs we offer to our distributors could include one or both of the following:
 
 
Under the contract sales debit program, products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to our various distributors. Distributors are required to pay for this product within our standard commercial terms. After the initial purchase of the product, the distributor has the opportunity to request a price allowance for a particular part number depending on the current market conditions for that specific part as well as volume considerations. This request is made prior to the distributor reselling the part. Once we have approved an allowance to the distributor, the distributor proceeds with the resale of the product and credits are issued to the distributor in accordance with the specific allowance that we approved. Periodically, we issue new distributor price books. For those parts for which the standard prices have been reduced, we provide an immediate credit to distributors for inventory quantities they have on hand.
Under the scrap allowance program, certain distributors are given a contractually defined allowance to cover the cost of any scrap they might incur. The amount of the allowance is specifically agreed upon with each distributor.
The revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs. Our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family, inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends and other related factors. We continuously monitor the claimed allowances against the rates assumed in our estimates of the allowances. Actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates.
 
Service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved, depending on the terms of the arrangement. These revenues are included in net sales and totaled $19.6 million in fiscal 2010, $17.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $25.1 million in fiscal 2008.
Certain intellectual property income is classified as revenue if it meets specified criteria established by company policy that defines whether it is considered a source of income from our primary operations. These revenues are included in net sales and totaled $1.3 million in fiscal 2010, $2.6 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2008. All other intellectual property income that does not meet the specified criteria is not considered a source of income from primary operations and is therefore classified as a component of other operating income, net, in the consolidated statement of income. Intellectual property income is recognized when the license is delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the fee is reasonably assured and remaining obligations are perfunctory or inconsequential to the other party.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. The total carrying value of our inventory is reduced for any difference between cost and estimated market value of inventory that is determined to be obsolete or unmarketable, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. We use the straight-line method to depreciate machinery and equipment over their estimated useful life (3-9 years). Buildings and improvements are depreciated using both straight-line and declining-balance methods over the assets' remaining estimated useful life (3-50 years), or, in the case of leasehold improvements, over the lesser of the estimated useful life or lease term.
We capitalize eligible costs to acquire software used internally. We use the straight-line method to amortize software used internally over its estimated useful life (generally 3-5 years). Internal-use software is included in the property, plant and equipment balance.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and as of May 30, 2010, we have six reporting units that contain goodwill.
We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. We assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter, which has been selected as the period for our recurring evaluation for all reporting units. Our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units containing goodwill. The fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. Our long-lived assets subject to this evaluation include property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets. Amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired, patents and technology licenses. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. If assets are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter than we originally estimated, we depreciate or amortize the net book value of the asset over the newly determined remaining useful lives.
We classify long-lived assets as assets held for sale when the criteria have been met, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment." Upon classification of an asset as held for sale, we cease depreciation of the asset and
 
classify the asset as a current asset at the lower of its carrying value or fair value (less cost to sell). If an asset is held for sale as a result of a restructuring of operations, any write down to fair value (less cost to sell) is included as a restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of income. When we commit to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we revise depreciation estimates to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. We review depreciation estimates periodically, including both estimated useful lives and estimated salvage values. These reviews may result in changes to historical depreciation rates, which are considered to be changes in accounting estimates and are accounted for on a prospective basis.
Income Taxes
We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using the enacted tax rates expected to be applied when the taxes are actually paid or realized. The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases become deductible.
Earnings per Share
We compute basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average common shares outstanding after giving effect to potential common shares from stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the treasury stock method.
For all years presented, the reported net income was used as the numerator in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of the shares used in the computation follows:
 
Anti-dilutive common equivalent shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the effect of these shares was anti-dilutive because the exercise price of the related stock options exceeded the average market price during the year. Shares related to outstanding stock options at May 30, 2010 that were anti-dilutive could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.
Currencies
The functional currency for all operations worldwide is the U.S. dollar. We include gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency financial statement balances into U.S. dollars and gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in net income were net foreign currency losses of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2009. Net income in fiscal 2008 included a net foreign currency gain of $2.1 million.
 
Financial Instruments
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. We maintain cash equivalents in various currencies and in a variety of financial instruments.
Deferred Compensation Plan Assets. Employee contributions under the deferred compensation plan (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in a rabbi trust and are not readily available to us. Participants can direct the investment of their deferred compensation plan accounts in the same investments funds offered by the 401(k) plan. Although participants direct the investment of these funds, they are classified as trading securities and are included in other assets because they remain assets of the company until they are actually paid out to the participants. We had deferred compensation plan assets of $40.3 million at May 30, 2010 and $40.9 million at May 31, 2009, which are included in other assets. In connection with these trading securities, we recorded a net gain of $5.3 million in fiscal 2010, and net losses of $7.7 million in fiscal 2009 and $6.2 million in fiscal 2008. There is an offset for the same amounts included in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, that represents the corresponding change in the liability associated with the employee deferred compensation plan due to the change in market value of these trading securities.
Derivative Financial Instruments. As part of our risk management strategy we use derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur from our underlying exposure with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. As a matter of company policy, we do not enter into speculative positions with derivative instruments. The criteria we use for designating an instrument as a hedge include the instrument's effectiveness in risk reduction and direct matching of the financial instrument to the underlying transaction.
We record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of these derivatives are accounted for based on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of our hedging activities and related accounting policies.
Share-based Compensation
We measure and record compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on estimated fair values in accordance with ASC Topic 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation." We provide share-based awards to our employees, executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee equity, stock option, stock purchase and restricted stock plans.
The fair value of stock option and stock purchase equity awards is measured at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The cash awards to be paid in connection with retention arrangements with each of our executive officers (approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors in November 2008) is considered a share-based payment award and measured at fair value since the award is indexed to the price of our common stock. The fair value of these cash awards is measured each reporting period and is calculated using the Monte Carlo valuation method.
The compensation expense for share-based awards is based on awards that are expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. We apply an annual forfeiture rate that is determined based on historical forfeiture activity. Our estimated forfeiture rate is evaluated each reporting period and, taking into consideration all available evidence both before and after the reporting date, we make appropriate adjustments. This forfeiture rate represents the awards expected to be forfeited each year and results in the recognition of share-based compensation expense over the vesting period for those awards that vest. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, forfeiture rates of 6.5 percent, 7.7 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, were applied for share-based compensation expense related to employee stock options (excluding officers).
 
Share-based compensation expense included in operating results for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 is presented in the following table:
 
The fair value of share-based awards to employees in connection with equity compensation plans was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that used the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $4.01, $5.83 and $8.49 per share, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of rights granted under the stock purchase plans was $4.06, $5.05 and $6.78 per share for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
The fair value of cash awards in connection with the executive officer retention arrangements was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method that used the following weighted-average assumptions as of May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009:
 
For all options granted after December 31, 2007, we determine expected life based on historical stock option exercise experience for the last four years, adjusted for our expectation of future exercise activity. For options granted prior to January 1, 2008, we use the simplified method specified by SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 to determine the expected life of stock options. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility, as management has determined that implied volatility better reflects the market's expectation of future volatility than historical volatility, and is determined based on our traded options, which are actively traded on several exchanges. We derive the implied volatility using the closing prices of traded options during a period that closely matches the timing of the option grant for the stock option and stock purchase plans, and on the last day of the quarter for the cash awards under the executive officer retention arrangements. The traded options selected for our measurement for the stock option and stock purchase plans are near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the option grants and have terms ranging from one to two years. The traded options selected for our measurement of the cash awards under the executive officer retention arrangements are near-the-money and at the closing price of our common stock on the last day of the quarter and have similar remaining terms (in years). The risk-free interest rate is based upon interest rates that match the expected life of the outstanding options under our employee stock option plans, the expected life of the purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and the retention period under the executive officer retention arrangements, as applicable. The dividend yield is based on recent history and our expectation of dividend payouts.
Under our equity compensation plans, employees who retire from the company and meet certain conditions set forth in the plans and related stock option grant agreements continue to vest in their stock options after retirement. During that post-retirement period of continued vesting, no service is required of the employee. Prior to fiscal 2007, we historically recognized compensation costs of these options using the nominal vesting period approach for pro forma reporting purposes. The FASB guidance specifies that a stock option award is considered to be vested when the employee's retention of the option is no longer contingent on the obligation to provide continuous service (the "non-substantive vesting period approach"). Under the non-substantive vesting period approach, the compensation cost should be recognized immediately for options granted to employees who are eligible for retirement at the time the option is granted. If an employee is not currently eligible for retirement, but is expected to become eligible during the nominal vesting period, then the compensation expense for the option should be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility occurs. Beginning in fiscal 2007, we changed the method for recognizing the compensation cost for these options to the non-substantive vesting period approach for those options that were granted beginning in fiscal 2007. If we had used the non-substantive vesting period approach in calculating the amounts for unvested option grants prior to fiscal 2007, the pre-tax share-based compensation expense would have been lower by $1.3 million in fiscal 2010, $6.8 million in fiscal 2009 and $14.2 million in fiscal 2008.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation. Net operating results have not been affected by these reclassifications.
Note 2. Fair Value Measurements
We measure and report our financial assets and liabilities under the provisions of ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," which we adopted in fiscal 2009. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2010, we adopted the FASB authoritative guidance for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. The adoption for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities had no significant effect on either our financial position or results of operations. Our non-financial assets subject to fair value measurements include goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured and recorded at fair value in the period they are determined to be impaired. As permitted under the FASB guidance, we did not apply its provisions to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities prior to fiscal 2010.
We measure fair value to record our cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and the deferred compensation plan assets. The measurement of fair value for our long-term debt is used to provide disclosure and is not used to record the carrying value of our long-term debt.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability.
The FASB guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
 
Level 1 assets and liabilities include our investments in institutional money-market funds that are classified as cash equivalents and the investment funds of the deferred compensation plan assets, where the respective financial instruments are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of activity.
 
Level 2 assets and liabilities include our investments in commercial paper that are classified as cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and our senior notes that represent long-term debt instruments that are less actively traded in the market, but where quoted market prices exist for similar instruments that are actively traded.
 
Level 3 assets and liabilities include goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are determined to be impaired, and our unsecured term loan with a bank, where we determine fair value based on unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances and take into consideration assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability.
 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:
 
There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 financial assets in fiscal 2010 and 2009.
The institutional money-market funds and the various investment funds within our deferred compensation plan assets are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value. We determine fair value of our commercial paper by obtaining non-binding market prices from our broker on the last day of each quarter. We then corroborate these market prices by comparison to quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts represents the present value difference between the stated forward contract rate and the current market forward rate at settlement. The fair value of foreign currency option contracts represents the probable weighted net amount we would expect to receive at maturity. The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined using a standard valuation model that includes significant observable inputs, such as interest rate yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the six-month LIBOR interest rates, as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties and our own nonperformance risk.
The fair value of our long-term debt (including the current portion) at May 30, 2010 was $1,339.2 million and at May 31, 2009 was $1,201.2 million. The fair value measurements for our long-term debt instruments take into consideration credit rating changes, equity price movements, interest rate changes and other economic variables.
 
Note 3. Financial Instruments
Cash Equivalents
Our policy is to diversify our investment portfolio to minimize the exposure of our principal to credit, geographic and investment sector risk. At May 30, 2010, investments were placed with a variety of different financial institutions and other issuers. Investments with maturity of one year or less have a rating of A1/P1 or better.
Our cash equivalents consisted of the following as of May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009:
 
Although our non-marketable investments had no carrying value at May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, we still hold stock in certain non-publicly traded companies. As a result, we recognized gross realized gains of $0.3 million in fiscal 2010, $0.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $0.2 million in fiscal 2008 from certain of our non-marketable investments.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The objective of our foreign exchange risk management policy is to preserve the U.S. dollar value of after-tax cash inflow in relation to non-U.S. dollar currency movements. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that is inherent in orders, sales, cost of sales, expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forwards and purchased options, to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are matched at inception to the related foreign currency exposures that are being hedged. Exposures which are hedged include sales by subsidiaries, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency hedges typically mature within six months.
Derivative instruments used to hedge exposures to variability in expected future foreign denominated cash flows are not designated as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are immediately recorded in earnings.
In connection with the issuance of the $250 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in April 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal of $250 million which effectively converts the fixed interest rate of the debt to a floating interest rate. The terms of the swap agreement substantially match the terms of the debt. Under the terms of the swap agreement, we will receive interest payments semi-annually at an annual rate of 3.95 percent on the notional principal and we will pay interest semi-annually at an annual rate of 0.84 percent over the six-month LIBOR on the notional principal. The LIBOR reference rate is set in arrears on each semi-annual date when the interest payments are due. We have designated this swap agreement as a fair value hedge and recognize the changes in the fair value of both the swap and the related debt, which we record as gains or losses on the derivative instrument in fair value hedge included in other non-operating income (expense), net.
 
The following table provides information about gains (losses) associated with our derivative financial instruments:
 
Fair Value and Notional Principal of Derivative Financial Instruments
The notional principal amounts for derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of fiscal year-end and do not represent the amount of the exposure to credit or market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information at May 30, 2010. The table below shows the fair value and notional principal of derivative financial instruments at May 30, 2010.
 
All of the foreign exchange contracts that we entered into during fiscal 2009 expired by May 31, 2009.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that may subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily investments and trade receivables. Our investment policy requires cash investments to be placed with high-credit quality counterparties and limits the amount of investments with any one financial institution or direct issuer. We sell our products to distributors and manufacturers involved in a variety of industries including computers and peripherals, wireless communications and automotive. We perform continuing credit evaluations of our customers whenever necessary and we generally do not require collateral. Our top ten customers combined represented approximately 58 percent of total accounts receivable at May 30, 2010 and approximately 60 percent of total accounts receivable at May 31, 2009.
 
Net sales to major customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:
 
 
Sales to the distributors included above are mostly for our Analog segment products, but also include some sales for our other operating segment products. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.

Fiscal 2010
We recorded a net charge of $20.1 million for severance and restructuring expenses in fiscal 2010. The following table provides additional detail related to these expenses:
 
We recorded a charge of $1.7 million for severance payments to employees who were terminated in connection with exit activities as part of the realignment of certain product line business units announced in May 2010. These exit activities are expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2010 and total cumulative charges are expected to be approximately $3 million to $4 million.
In connection with the workforce reduction and plant closures announced in March 2009 (See the discussion under fiscal 2009), we recorded a net charge of $21.5 million in fiscal 2010 for additional severance and restructuring expenses that were partially offset by the equipment gains described below. The restructuring expenses include $28.7 million of other exit-related costs associated with closure and transfer activities that occurred at our manufacturing sites in Texas and China during fiscal 2010.
 
By the second half of fiscal 2010, the global economy began to slowly recover as revenue prospects have improved significantly. An increasing portion of our revenues has been coming from a portfolio of products that are primarily manufactured in our wafer fabrication facility in Greenock, Scotland. Management believes there is a larger market with a longer life for these products than was previously assumed and has decided to increase its manufacturing capacity in Scotland. Certain equipment previously classified as held for sale, primarily the Texas equipment, will now be used in our manufacturing facility in Scotland. We recognized an impairment charge of $23.0 million related to this equipment in March 2009. The carrying value of this equipment has been adjusted based on the lower of its carrying value before being classified as held for sale (adjusted for any depreciation that would have been recognized had it been continuously classified as held and used), or its fair value at the time management decided the equipment would no longer be sold. Since the date we first classified this equipment as held for sale to the date we reclassified it as held and used, the fair value of this equipment has increased. As a result, we recorded a gain of $1.2 million to restore the carrying value of the equipment to fair value which was lower than what its carrying value would have been had it been continuously classified as held and used. The weighted average remaining life of this equipment at the time we classified it as held for sale was 7.8 years and now that it has been reclassified as held and used, its weighted-average remaining life is 7.3 years. We also recorded a gain of $1.3 million upon completing the sale of some of the equipment in China and Texas during fiscal 2010. In addition, we recorded a recovery of $5.2 million due to adjustments to reduce accrued severance expenses for manufacturing employees who voluntarily terminated prior to their scheduled departure dates and for severance packages that were finalized with certain employees in foreign locations.
Since these net charges relate to actions announced in fiscal 2009, total cumulative net charges (including the net charges incurred in fiscal 2010 and 2009) through May 30, 2010 for these actions are presented in the following table:
 
We have ceased production activity in both China (end of August 2009) and Texas (end of fiscal 2010). Remaining activities associated with the closures of the China and Texas manufacturing facilities are expected to continue over the next 2 quarters. We expect to incur approximately $11 million to $16 million over the same period for other exit-related costs associated with these remaining activities. As a result, total charges for all actions announced in March 2009 are expected to be approximately $150 million to $155 million. Most of this amount will be reported within our corporate group, which is not considered an operating segment, and will be included in the category described as "All Others."
Since production activity ceased in China by the end of August 2009, we have been actively engaged in locating buyers to purchase the manufacturing facility and its existing machinery and equipment in its current condition. In addition, certain equipment that was no longer being used in our Texas manufacturing operations is expected to be sold. As a result, the China plant assets and the Texas equipment, which had a carrying value of $22.4 million after impairment charges, were classified as held for sale at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2010. As discussed above, some of the equipment in China and Texas, which had a carrying value of $1.6 million, was sold during fiscal 2010. Equipment previously classified as held for sale that will now be used in our manufacturing facility in Scotland had a carrying value of $3.8 million. By the end of the fiscal year, we ceased production activity in Texas and we are also actively engaged in locating buyers to purchase the manufacturing facility and its existing machinery and equipment in its current condition. The Texas facility and its manufacturing machinery and equipment that had been used through the end of production activity have a carrying value of $28.8 million. As a result, all of the China and Texas plant assets, which have a total carrying value of $45.8 million, have been classified as held for sale and are reported in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of May 30, 2010. We have ceased depreciation on these assets and now measure the carrying value at the lower of historical net book value or fair value (less cost to sell).
 
The fiscal 2010 net charge for severance and restructuring expenses described above includes a recovery of $3.0 million for an adjustment to reduce accrued severance expenses upon finalizing severance packages with certain terminated employees in foreign locations in connection with the workforce reduction announced in November 2008. It also includes a recovery of $0.1 million recorded upon the release of a residual accrued balance for other exit-related costs associated with the fiscal 2008 manufacturing restructure.
Fiscal 2009
We recorded a net charge of $143.9 million for severance and restructuring expenses in fiscal 2009. The following table provides additional detail related to these expenses:
 
In March 2009, we announced that we would take actions to reduce overall expenses in response to weak economic conditions and related business levels. As part of the plan, we eliminated approximately 850 positions worldwide in our product lines, sales and marketing, manufacturing and support functions. The majority of the affected employees departed by the end of fiscal 2009. We also planned to further reduce headcount by approximately 875 through the eventual closure of our wafer fabrication facility in Arlington, Texas and our assembly and test plant in Suzhou, China. The departure of these additional employees coincides with the phased timing of the plant closures. As a result of these actions, we recorded $117.3 million in fiscal 2009, which includes severance costs of $59.7 million, asset impairment charges of $54.3 million and other exit-related costs of $3.3 million associated with closure and transfer activities incurred in fiscal 2009. Included in the asset impairment charges is $9.8 million related to the modification of a CAD software license that reduced the volume of licenses available for use by the company.
In November 2008, we announced a global workforce reduction that eliminated approximately 330 positions in response to the uncertain business climate at that time. These positions were primarily in non-manufacturing functions in our product line, marketing and sales, and general administrative operations. In addition to the workforce reduction, we closed two design centers located in the United States. As a result of this action, we recorded severance and restructuring expenses of $26.4 million in fiscal 2009, which represents the total amount expected to be incurred. This amount includes severance costs of $25.5 million, other exit-related costs of $0.1 million and $0.8 million for the impairment of abandoned equipment.
 
In addition to the actions described above, we recorded a net charge of $0.3 million related to the workforce reduction and manufacturing restructure announced in fiscal 2008. All activities related to these actions have now been completed. This amount includes a $2.2 million charge for other exit-related costs primarily incurred in connection with dismantling and removing equipment. This charge was partially offset by a recovery of $1.9 million, which includes $1.4 million primarily due to an adjustment to reduce accrued severance expenses upon finalizing severance packages with certain terminated employees in foreign locations and a gain of $0.5 million from the subsequent sale of some of the equipment that had been previously written down.
Fiscal 2008
We recorded a net charge of $27.2 million for severance and restructuring expenses in fiscal 2008. The following table provides additional detail related to these expenses:
 
In April 2008, we announced a workforce reduction that eliminated approximately 128 positions across the company, primarily in product line and support functions as part of our effort to strategically align resources in connection with our focus on accelerating revenue growth in key market areas that require better power management and energy efficiency. As a result of this action, we recorded a charge of $9.6 million for severance.
In January 2008, we announced that we would dispose of certain manufacturing equipment and reduce the workforce at our wafer fabrication facilities as part of an action to modernize our facilities and rationalize our capacity. Substantially all activities related to this action were completed by the end of calendar 2008. In connection with this action, we eliminated approximately 200 positions, primarily at our manufacturing plants located in Arlington, Texas; South Portland, Maine; and Greenock, Scotland. As a result, we recorded a total charge of $19.1 million. Of this amount, $13.2 million was for severance and $3.2 million was other exit-related costs for dismantling and removing equipment. This amount also included $4.5 million for the impairment of equipment. These charges were partially offset by a $1.8 million gain recognized upon the subsequent sale of some of the equipment.
In June 2007, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of a facility we vacated as part of a previous cost reduction action. The agreement terminated the lease and we settled the remaining obligations under the lease agreement for $4.2 million. As a result, we recorded a $1.5 million recovery for the release of the residual accrued balance of the lease obligation.
In June 2007, we completed the sale of our assembly and test plant in Singapore that was closed in fiscal 2007. The facility and its residual equipment were sold for $12.0 million to an unrelated third party. The carrying value of the assets sold was $7.6 million. As a result, we recorded a gain of $3.1 million in fiscal 2008, after deducting final transaction costs of $1.3 million. These assets were part of our manufacturing operation, which is not considered an operating segment, but is a corporate group included in the category described as "All Others."
 
Summary of Activities
The following table provides a summary of the activities related to our severance and restructuring costs included in accrued expenses during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008:
 
During fiscal 2010 we paid severance to 564 employees in connection with the workforce reductions announced in fiscal 2009. Payments for other exit-related costs were primarily for expenses associated with closure and transfer activities incurred in connection with the closures of our manufacturing facilities in Texas and China.
The balances at May 30, 2010 primarily represent remaining estimated costs for activities that have occurred, but have yet to be paid, as a result of the workforce reduction and the manufacturing plant closures announced in fiscal 2009. Payments for the remaining $13.1 million of severance balances are expected to be paid over the next 3 quarters as we complete the closures of our two manufacturing facilities and most of those affected employees will depart by the end of our fiscal 2011 first quarter. Severance amounts are generally paid 30-60 days after the employee's actual departure date or may be deferred until the beginning of the calendar year after their departure date. Other exit-related costs primarily relate to expenses associated with closure and transfer activities occurring in these manufacturing locations.
 
Note 7. Acquisition
Fiscal 2010
In October 2009, we acquired Energy Recommerce Inc. (ERI), a privately held solar energy company that provides web-based monitoring of commercial photovoltaic systems performance. The acquisition of ERI expands our portfolio of power management technologies.
Beginning in fiscal 2010, we adopted ASC Topic 805, "Business Combinations," which changed the accounting for business combinations. The acquisition of ERI was accounted for under the new guidance using the acquisition method of accounting with a purchase price of $6.1 million for all of the outstanding shares of the company's common stock. The purchase price was allocated as follows:
 
Goodwill is included in our Analog segment and primarily represents the expected value of future customers and future technologies that have yet to be determined. Future customers and technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill, because they are part of the future development and growth of the business. No amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Revenue and earnings of ERI since the acquisition date included in our operating results for fiscal 2010 were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations related to this acquisition have not been presented since ERI's operating results up to the date of acquisition were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
Fiscal 2009
In March 2009, we acquired ActSolar, Inc. ("ActSolar"), a privately-held solar energy company that provides power optimization solutions for commercial and utility-scale solar installations. The acquisition of ActSolar was intended to expand our portfolio of power optimization technologies and provide us with new diagnostics and panel monitoring capabilities for solar arrays. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with a purchase price of $4.8 million for all of the outstanding shares of the company's common stock. As a result, we recorded a $2.9 million in-process R&D charge in fiscal 2009. In-process R&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses exist. The remainder of the purchase price was allocated as follows:
 
Pro forma results of operations related to this acquisition have not been presented since ActSolar's operating results up to the date of acquisition were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
 
Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The following table presents goodwill by reportable segments:
 
In fiscal 2010, we recorded $4.6 million of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of ERI (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
In fiscal 2009, one of our reporting units containing goodwill that was previously included in the Analog segment was reorganized into a reporting unit that is included in the category of "All Others." We recorded $1.0 million of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of ActSolar in fiscal 2009 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
We have intangible assets of $2.9 million at May 30, 2010 and $1.4 million at May 31, 2009, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. These intangible assets primarily include developed technology and other amortizable intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 6.7 years. Amortization expense was $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 and $0.1 million in fiscal 2009. There was no amortization expense in fiscal 2008.
Note 9. Asset Retirement Obligations
Our asset retirement obligations arise primarily from contractual commitments to decontaminate machinery and equipment used at our manufacturing facilities at the time we dispose of or replace them. We also have leased facilities where we have asset retirement obligations from contractual commitments to remove leasehold improvements and return the property to a specified condition when the lease terminates.
We have not recognized any asset retirement obligations associated with the closure or abandonment of the manufacturing facilities we own. Our legal asset retirement obligations for manufacturing facilities arise primarily from local laws and statutes that establish minimum standards or requirements in the event a manufacturing facility is shut down, or otherwise exited or abandoned. As a result, we considered the timing and (or) method of settlement for a conditional asset retirement obligation in the measurement of the related liability and determined that the asset retirement obligations related to these facilities were immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations.
The following table presents the activity for the asset retirement obligations included in other non-current liabilities for the years ended May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009:
 
 
Note 10. Debt
Debt at fiscal year-end consisted of the following:
 
 
In April 2010, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes through a public offering. The unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.95 percent and are due in April 2015. Interest is payable semi-annually and the notes are redeemable by us at any time.
In April 2010, we repaid in full the outstanding principal on our unsecured term loan with a consortium of banks prior to its original maturity of June 2012. There was no prepayment penalty fee associated with the early repayment of the loan. The repayment resulted in a cash outlay of $203.6 million which included the aggregate principal amount outstanding and accrued interest through the repayment date. We recorded a $2.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt to recognize the remaining unamortized issuance costs that were included in other assets.
In June 2007, we issued $1.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes through a public offering. The offering of unsecured notes included $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2010, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15 percent senior notes due June 2012 and $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.60 percent senior notes due June 2017. Interest on the senior fixed rate notes is payable semi-annually and the notes are redeemable by us at any time. In June 2010, we repaid in full the $250.0 million principal amount of senior floating rate notes that became due June 2010. The total amount of the repayment was $250.3 million which included the aggregate principal amount outstanding and accrued interest through the repayment date.
The unsecured promissory note, which is denominated in Japanese yen (2,408,750,000), is due November 2010. Interest is payable quarterly at a fixed 2.5 percent annual rate. We are also required to comply with the covenants set forth under our multi-currency agreement.
The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at May 30, 2010 are presented in the following table:
 
 
The estimated fair value of long-term debt was $1,339.2 million at May 30, 2010.
We have a $20 million multicurrency credit agreement with a bank that provides for multicurrency loans, letters of credit and standby letters of credit that was renewed in October 2009. At May 30, 2010, we had committed $3.4 million of the credit available under the agreement. The agreement contains restrictive covenants, conditions and default provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of May 30, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the agreement. The agreement expires in October 2010 and we expect to renew it before then.
Note 11. Income Taxes
Worldwide pretax income from operations and income taxes consist of the following:
 
Although the fiscal 2010 income tax expense of $59.4 million is higher than the fiscal 2009 income tax expense of $40.3 million, our effective tax rate is lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 income tax expense includes a tax benefit of $7.4 million primarily arising from the repatriation of previously unremitted Japanese earnings. In addition, a portion of our earnings comes from our Malaysian subsidiary and is not taxable because of a tax holiday granted by the Malaysian government that is effective for a ten-year period that began in our fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2009 income tax expense of $40.3 million included incremental tax expense of $16.7 million related to the write down of foreign deferred tax assets that would no longer be realized in the foreseeable future due to the tax holiday granted by the Malaysian government. The effect of the write down of foreign deferred tax assets was partially offset by $15.0 million of tax benefits associated with R&D tax credits, net of the portion of the tax benefit that did not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. Income tax expense of $118.9 million for fiscal 2008 included $31.9 million in tax benefits recognized during fiscal 2008 that arose primarily from the resolution of international tax inquiries, the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with international tax matters and costs related to the manufacturing restructure and workforce reduction actions.
At the beginning of fiscal 2008, we adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," which provided further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. The cumulative effect of applying the new accounting standards was a $37.1 million increase to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2008. Historically, we have classified unrecognized tax benefits as current income taxes payable. We now classify unrecognized tax benefits as long-term income taxes payable except to the extent we anticipate cash payment within the next year.
 
The following table provides a summary of the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that are included in long-term income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet at May 30, 2010:
 
At May 30, 2010, $156.6 million of the unrecognized tax benefit would affect our effective tax rate if it were to be recognized in a future period. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued was $18.7 million at May 30, 2010 and $16.4 million at May 31, 2009.
We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the exact timing of resolution for any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits we have accrued reflect our best estimate. We adjust these amounts, as well as the related interest and penalties, as actual facts and circumstances change. Upon resolution of an uncertain tax position, we record an adjustment to income taxes in the same period.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits mainly related to transfer pricing matters for tax years where the statutes of limitation expire during fiscal 2011 could decrease by as much as $3.9 million within the next year.
Our federal tax returns for fiscal 2007 through 2009 are currently under examination by the IRS. In addition, the IRS will audit our amended federal tax returns for fiscal 2005 and 2006. Several state taxing jurisdictions are examining our state tax returns for fiscal 2001 through 2005. During fiscal 2010, the state of California closed its audits of fiscal years up through fiscal 2000, which resulted in an immaterial adjustment. With a few exceptions, state tax returns for fiscal 2000 and after remain subject to future examination by state tax authorities. Internationally, tax authorities from several foreign jurisdictions are also examining our tax returns. In general, our international tax returns for fiscal 2003 and after remain subject to examination.
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that constitute significant portions of the deferred tax assets are presented below:
 
The decrease in net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2010 of $8.3 million is from continuing operations and from the tax effect on other comprehensive income items.
We record a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The valuation allowance has been established primarily against the reinvestment and investment tax allowances related to our operation in Malaysia, as we have concluded that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future due to a tax holiday granted by the Malaysian government that is effective for a ten-year period that began in our fiscal 2010 and the uncertainty of sufficient taxable income in Malaysia beyond fiscal 2019. We have a deferred tax asset related to the California R&D credits which can be carried forward indefinitely and we have concluded that a valuation allowance is not required against it since our estimate of future taxable income for California purposes in the long term (greater than 15 years) is considered more than sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset during the same time period. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $1.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of $15.6 million in fiscal 2009.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As of May 30, 2010, based on historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance.
The reconciliation between the income tax rate computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate and the reported worldwide tax rate follows:
 
No U.S. income taxes have been provided on the cumulative unremitted earnings of approximately $108.5 million from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of May 30, 2010. It is not practicable to determine the U.S. income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings was not reinvested indefinitely. We intend to continue reinvesting certain foreign earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely.
 
At May 30, 2010, we had $11.9 million of state net operating loss carryovers, which expire between fiscal 2011 and 2022. We also had $125.1 million of state credit carryovers, consisting primarily of California R&D credits of $124.8 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we had net operating losses and other tax allowance carryovers of $432.0 million from certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, most of which do not expire.
Note 12. Retirement and Pension Plans
The annual expense for all retirement and pension plans was as follows:
 
U.S. Plans
Our retirement and savings program for U.S. employees consists of a salary deferral 401(k) plan. The salary deferral 401(k) plan allows employees to defer up to 30 percent of their salaries, subject to certain limitations, with partially matching company contributions. To encourage employee participation, we make a matching contribution of 150 percent of the employee's contribution to the 401(k) plan, up to the first 4 percent of the employee's eligible salary. Contributions are invested in one or more of thirty investment funds at the discretion of the employee. One of the investment funds is a stock fund in which contributions are invested in National common stock at the discretion of the employee. 401(k) investments made by the employee in National common stock may be sold at any time at the employee's direction. Although we have reserved 10,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance to the stock fund, shares purchased to date with contributions have been purchased on the open market and we have not issued any stock directly to the stock fund.
We also have a deferred compensation plan, which allows highly compensated employees (as defined by IRS regulations) to defer greater percentages of compensation than would otherwise be permitted under the salary deferral 401(k) plan and IRS regulations. The deferred compensation plan is a non-qualified plan of deferred compensation maintained in a rabbi trust. Participants can direct the investment of their deferred compensation plan accounts in the same investment funds offered by the 401(k) plan.
International Plans
Certain of our international subsidiaries have varying types of defined benefit pension and retirement plans that comply with local statutes and practices.
We maintain defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., Germany and Taiwan that cover all eligible employees within each respective country. Prior to August 2007, we also had a defined benefit pension plan in Japan, which was terminated in full and replaced by a defined contribution plan in August 2007. As a result, we incurred a total charge of $0.2 million for the curtailment and settlement of the defined benefit pension plan.
Pension plan benefits are based primarily on participants' compensation and years of service credited as specified under the terms of each country's plan. The funding policy is consistent with the local requirements of each country. We may also voluntarily fund additional annual contributions as determined by management.
Beginning in fiscal 2009, we adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 715, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits," that requires the measurement date of a plan's funded status to be the same as the company's fiscal year-end. As a result, the measurement date of February 28
th
for one of our plans was changed to May 31
st
. In lieu of remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 and using those new measurements to determine the effect of the measurement date change, we used the alternative approach permitted by GAAP. Under the alternative approach, the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations determined as of February 28, 2008 were used to estimate the effect of the measurement date change. As a result, the net periodic pension cost for the 15-month period from February 28, 2008 to May 31, 2009 was allocated proportionately between amounts to be recognized as an adjustment of retained earnings for the portion of the 15-month period in fiscal 2008 and net periodic pension cost for the remaining portion in fiscal 2009. As a result, we recorded an adjustment of $0.6 million to retained earnings representing the effect of the change in measurement date for this plan.
 
Plan assets of the funded defined benefit pension plans are invested in funds held by third-party fund managers or are deposited into government-managed accounts in which we are not actively involved with and have no control over investment strategy. Two of the plans are self-funded plans. The plan assets held by third-parties consist primarily of U.S. and foreign equity securities, bonds and cash. The fund manager monitors the fund's asset allocation within the guidelines established by the plan's Board of Trustees. In line with plan investment objectives and consultation with company management, the Trustees set an allocation benchmark among equity, bond and other assets based on the relative weighting of overall international market indices. The overall investment objectives of the plan are 1) the acquisition of suitable assets of appropriate liquidity which will generate income and capital growth to meet current and future plan benefits, 2) to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the long term liabilities of the plan and 3) to minimize the long term costs of the plan by maximizing the return on the assets. Performance is regularly evaluated by the Trustees and is based on actual returns achieved by the fund manager relative to its benchmark. The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based on analysis of historical data and future expectations relevant to the investments and consistency with the assumed rate of inflation implicit in the market.
The following table presents target allocation percentages and the fiscal year end percentage for each major category of plan assets:
 
The following table presents the fair value of plan assets by major categories using the same three-level hierarchy described in Note 2:
 
For all of our plans the discount rates represent the rates at which benefits could have been settled at the measurement date and were determined based on an analysis of the investment returns underlying annuity contracts, or alternatively the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed interest investments for liability durations that match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments. The source data used to determine the discount rates for the U.K. and Germany plans are based on the published iBoxx index of AA bond yields for durations of over 15 years. The yields at the plans' measurement dates were approximately 5.25 to 5.46 percent. While no formal liability cash flow projections were made for these plans, the mean term of their liabilities was determined for assessing appropriate bond durations. Our plan in Taiwan is not material.
 
Net annual periodic pension cost of these non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is presented in the following table:
 
Changes in the benefit obligations and plans assets are presented in the following table:
 
 
Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:
 
Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost:
 
The net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations were determined using the following assumptions:
 
Total contributions paid to these plans were $6.8 million in fiscal 2010, $15.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $33.6 million in fiscal 2008. We currently expect contributions to total approximately $5.2 million in fiscal 2011. This amount excludes any voluntary contribution, which is yet to be determined by management.
The following table presents the total expected benefits to be paid to plan participants for the next ten fiscal years as determined based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of the fiscal year:
 
Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year:
 
 
Note 13. Shareholders' Equity
Stock Repurchase Programs
Fiscal 2010
During fiscal 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in connection with the $500 million stock repurchase program we announced in June 2007. Under this program, we have a balance of $127.4 million remaining available for future stock repurchases at May 30, 2010. We do not have any plans to terminate the program prior to its completion, and there is no expiration date for this repurchase program.
Fiscal 2009
We repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2009 for $128.4 million as part of the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in June 2007. All of these shares were repurchased in the open market and have been cancelled as of May 31, 2009.
Fiscal 2008
In June 2007, our Board of Directors approved (i) a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program; and (ii) an additional $500 million stock repurchase program similar to our existing stock repurchase program announced in March 2007. We entered into two separate agreements with Goldman Sachs to conduct the accelerated stock repurchase program. Under one of the agreements, we repurchased from Goldman Sachs, for $1.0 billion, a number of shares of our common stock determined by the volume-weighted average price of the stock during a six month period, subject to provisions establishing minimum and maximum numbers of shares. Under the other agreement, we repurchased shares of our common stock from Goldman Sachs immediately for an initial amount of $500 million. Goldman Sachs purchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock in the open market over the next six months, and at the end of that period, the initial price was adjusted down based on the volume-weighted average price during the same period. The price adjustment was settled by us, at our option, in shares of our common stock. The $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program was completed in December 2007 with a total 58.0 million shares repurchased.
In addition to the accelerated stock repurchase program, we repurchased an additional 27.9 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2008 for $623.5 million as part of two $500 million stock repurchase programs: (i) the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in March 2007, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and (ii) the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in June 2007. All of these shares were repurchased in the open market. For all of fiscal 2008, we repurchased a total of 85.9 million shares of our common stock for $2,123.5 million through both the $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program and the two $500 million stock repurchase programs. All shares of common stock that were repurchased had been cancelled as of the end of fiscal 2008.
Dividends
We paid cash dividends of $75.7 million in fiscal 2010, $64.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $50.6 million in fiscal 2008. In June 2010, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per outstanding share of common stock, which was paid on July 12, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 21, 2010. On July 12, 2010, in connection with a regularly scheduled meeting, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on October 12, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 20, 2010.
Note 14. Share-based Compensation Plans
In September 2009, the shareholders of National approved the 2009 Incentive Award Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2009 Plan replaces our four former equity compensation plans that provided share-based awards to employees and officers of the company (the 1977 Stock Option Plan, the 2007 Employees Equity Plan (EEP), the 2005 Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP) and the Executive Officer Stock Option Plan) and no further awards will be made to employees and officers under those plans. While new options can no longer be granted, there are options that are still outstanding under those plans. The 2009 Plan authorizes 16,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance to eligible individuals in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend equivalents, stock payments, deferred stock, other stock-based awards and performance-based awards. In addition to employees and officers of the company, members of our Board of Directors and consultants to the company are eligible to participate, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of May 30, 2010, up to 13.2 million shares were available for future issuance of all equity awards under the 2009 Plan.
 
Stock Option Plans
The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options (as defined in the U.S. tax code). The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of stock options at fair market value on the date of grant. The term and vesting period of the stock options are set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. To date, options granted under the terms of the 2009 Plan expire no later than six years and one day after the date of grant and vest one-fourth of the total grant one year after grant and the rest in equal monthly installments over the next three years. The terms of stock options granted under the former equity compensation plans were similar to the 2009 Plan.
We have a director stock option plan that was approved by shareholders in fiscal 1998 which authorized the grant of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock to eligible directors who are not employees of the company. Options were granted automatically upon approval of the plan by shareholders and were granted automatically to eligible directors upon their appointment to the board and subsequent election to the board by shareholders. In connection with the approval of amendments to the director stock plan in fiscal 2006, this plan was frozen and no new options can be granted under the plan. Options issued to directors under this plan vested in full after six months. Under this plan, options to purchase 350,000 shares of common stock with a weighted-average per share exercise price of $14.24 and weighted-average remaining contractual life of 2.3 years were outstanding and exercisable as of May 30, 2010. The aggregate intrinsic value of these fully vested shares was $0.7 million at May 30, 2010.
Under the former EOEP, options to purchase 1,280,000 shares of common stock were granted in fiscal 2010, options to purchase 565,000 shares of common stock were granted in fiscal 2009 and options to purchase 520,000 shares of common stock were granted in fiscal 2008. These shares are included in the amounts presented in the table that summarizes stock option activity. Grants will no longer be made under the EOEP.
As of May 30, 2010, under all equity compensation plans for stock options there were 44.4 million shares reserved for issuance. The following table summarizes the activity of common stock shares related to stock options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 under our equity plans (excluding the director stock option plan under which new options can no longer be granted):
 
Expiration dates for options outstanding at May 30, 2010 range from June 1, 2010 to May 18, 2016.
 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $7.9 million in fiscal 2010, $27.8 million in fiscal 2009 and $79.2 million in fiscal 2008. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants as of May 30, 2010 was $21.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.
The following table provides additional information about total options outstanding at May 30, 2010 under the stock option plans (excluding the director stock option plan):
 
Stock Purchase Plan
We have an employee stock purchase plan approved by shareholders that authorizes the issuance of up to 16,000,000 shares to eligible employees worldwide. Our stock purchase plan uses a captive broker and we deposit shares purchased by the employee with the captive broker. In addition, for international participants, the National subsidiary that the participant is employed by is responsible for paying to us the difference between the purchase price set by the terms of the plan and the fair market value at the time of the purchase. This plan allows employees to purchase shares of the company's common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the common stock's fair market value at the time of enrollment in one of two six-month purchase periods in a one-year offering period or the end of the purchase period.
Under the terms of our stock purchase plan, we issued 1.8 million shares in fiscal 2010, 2.2 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 1.5 million shares in fiscal 2008 to employees for $19.2 million, $24.0 million and $26.0 million, respectively. As of May 30, 2010 there were 4.8 million shares reserved for future issuance under the stock purchase plan.
Other Forms of Equity Compensation
The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock and restricted stock units that are subject to restrictions which may be based exclusively on the passage of time or may also include performance conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Vesting for both restricted stock and restricted stock units can begin to occur six months after grant and the minimum full vesting period for non-performance contingent restricted shares is three years. The minimum vesting period for any performance contingent restricted shares is one year. Restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the former EEP and restricted stock plan were also subject to restrictions based exclusively on the passage of time or included performance conditions and have similar vesting requirements. We use restricted stock awards as a retention vehicle for employees with technical skills and expertise that are important to us.
 
The following table provides a summary of activity during fiscal 2010 for grants of restricted stock not yet vested and restricted stock units under the restricted stock plan, the EEP and the 2009 Plan (excluding units granted with performance based restrictions):
 
The total fair value of restricted shares that vested in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock shares and restricted stock units outstanding as of May 30, 2010 was $26.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.
We have a director stock plan, which has been approved by shareholders, that authorizes the issuance of up to 900,000 shares of common stock to eligible directors who are not employees of the company. The stock is issued automatically to eligible new directors upon their appointment to the board and to all eligible directors on their subsequent election to the board by shareholders. Directors may also elect to take their annual retainer fees for board membership and committee chairmanship in stock under the plan. The shares issued to the directors under the plan are restricted from transfer for between six and thirty-six months. As of May 30, 2010 we had issued 796,047 shares under the director stock plan and had reserved 103,953 shares for future issuances. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested shares under the director stock plan as of May 30, 2010 was $0.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. We will continue to grant awards to members of our Board of Directors under the existing director stock plan until all remaining authorized shares have been used. At that time, future awards will then be granted under the 2009 Plan.
With respect to performance share units under the EOEP, 259,374 shares were issued upon completion in July 2009 of the third two-year performance period. Targets for a fifth two-year performance period were established in July 2009 and will be measured after the end of fiscal 2011. In addition, targets for a one-year performance period were established, which will be measured after the end of fiscal 2010, but requires a two-year vesting period. In fiscal 2009, no shares were issued upon completion in July 2008 of the second two-year performance period because minimum performance thresholds were not achieved and in fiscal 2008, 1,005,000 shares were issued upon completion in July 2007 of the first performance period. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance share units as of May 30, 2010 was $12.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 years.
After the end of fiscal 2010, the fourth two-year performance period was measured upon its completion and since minimum performance thresholds were not achieved, no shares were issued in July 2010. Under the 2009 Plan, targets for a sixth two-year performance period were established in June 2010 and will be measured after the end of fiscal 2012.
In November 2008, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved retention arrangements for each of our executive officers that cover the ensuing two-year period and provide each executive officer with a cash award to be paid on or about November 30, 2010. The amount of the cash award is based on the average daily closing price of our common stock for the second fiscal quarter ending November 28, 2010, which amount increases depending on five
 
specified stock price ranges that fall between a minimum and maximum price as set forth under each arrangement. The cash award is considered a share-based payment award and measured at fair value since the award is indexed to the price of our common stock. We measure compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the cash award at the end of each reporting period and include that amount in share-based compensation expense. To calculate fair value, we use the Monte Carlo valuation method which estimates the probability of the potential payouts. The fair value of the cash award is amortized over the retention period and recognized as a liability reported in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of May 30, 2010. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the executive officer retention awards at May 30, 2010 was $2.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.5 years.
Stock Option Exchange Program
We completed a stock option exchange program in November 2009. Like many companies, we had experienced a significant decline in our stock price during calendar 2008 and 2009 as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. Our employees held stock options with exercise prices significantly above the recent trading prices of our common stock. The stock option exchange program offered our employees the opportunity to surrender certain of those outstanding stock options for cancellation in exchange for a number of restricted stock units to be granted under the 2009 Plan having a value roughly equivalent to the value of the options exchanged. Named executive officers and members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in the option exchange program.
Under the exchange program, eligible stock options with an exercise price of $17.00 and above could be exchanged for restricted stock units at an exchange ratio that ranged between 5 to 1 and 10 to 1 depending on the actual exercise prices of the eligible stock options. The exchange ratios for the option exchange were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a computation of expected volatility based on a combination of historical and implied volatility. We used this model to enable us to calculate exchange ratios that would result in a fair value of the new restricted stock units to be effectively equal to the fair value of the surrendered eligible stock options and as such, incremental compensation expense was immaterial.
Under the exchange program, eligible stock options to purchase an aggregate of 12,830,732 shares held by 1,713 employees were cancelled. Of this amount, eligible options to purchase 11,988,793 shares were cancelled and exchanged for a total of 1,670,944 new restricted stock units on November 16, 2009. The aggregate fair value of the restricted stock units was $22.7 million based on the closing price of our common stock on the exchange date. These restricted stock units will vest ratably each year for four years unless the exchanged stock options were fully vested, in which case they will vest ratably each year for three years. Under the terms of the exchange program, a cash payment was offered for the surrender of eligible stock options for which application of the exchange ratios would result in the issuance of less than 100 restricted stock units. Eligible options to purchase 841,939 shares were cancelled in exchange for an aggregate $1.3 million cash payment made to employees on November 16, 2009. As a result of the cash payments, share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010 includes an incremental expense of $1.7 million.
Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We lease certain facilities and equipment under operating lease arrangements. Rental expenses under operating leases were $24.5 million, $29.8 million and $31.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Future minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
 
 
In October 2009, we entered into a five-year warehouse services agreement with a local supplier in Singapore who will provide warehousing and distribution services for our finished products. Under the terms of the agreement, we are committed to purchase services based on the delivery of a minimum volume of our finished products at specified rates (depending on the volume delivered) as determined in the agreement. The minimum purchases under the agreement are $3.1 million in each of the next 4 years (fiscal 2011 through 2014) and a remaining $1.3 million in fiscal 2015. We purchased $3.9 million of warehouse services under this agreement in fiscal 2010.
We have an agreement with a local energy supplier in Maine to purchase electricity for our manufacturing facility located there. The agreement began in January 2006 and is a five-year term full requirement contract with no minimum purchase commitments. The agreement allows for a fixed purchase price if the annual volume purchased falls within a specified range as determined by the terms of the agreement. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we purchased $8.9 million, $8.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively, for electricity usage under this agreement. We also had an agreement with a local energy supplier in Texas to purchase electricity for our manufacturing facility located there. The agreement was a three-year bulk contract where service began in June 2006. However, the agreement was terminated prior to its expiration since our level of future electricity usage was expected to be significantly reduced due to the action announced in January 2008 to modernize our facilities and rationalize the capacity in our manufacturing plants. We paid a $1.0 million penalty fee and entered into a separate agreement with the same supplier for the purchase of electricity for the remainder of the service period provided under the former agreement. The new agreement, which expired at the end of fiscal 2009, required us to purchase a minimum level of electricity at a specified price as determined by the terms of the agreement. Under that agreement, we purchased a total of $6.0 million for electricity usage in fiscal 2009 and a total of $5.5 million for electricity usage under both agreements in fiscal 2008.
We have an agreement with a supplier in Malacca, Malaysia to purchase industrial gases for our manufacturing facility located there. The agreement began in May 2007 and runs through May 2022. Under the terms of the agreement we can purchase up to a certain monthly volume of gas products based on specified prices as determined by the terms of the agreement. The agreement permits the review of these prices every five years if such prices vary by more or less than 10 percent of fair market value. Minimum purchases under the agreement are $506 thousand in each of the next 5 years (fiscal 2011 through 2015) and a remaining $3.5 million in fiscal 2016 and thereafter. We purchased $1.0 million of gas products under this agreement in both fiscal 2010 and 2009. In fiscal 2008, we purchased $0.9 million of gas product.
We are party to a master operating lease agreement for capital equipment under which individual operating lease agreements are executed as the delivery and acceptance of scheduled equipment occurs. The required future minimum lease payments under these operating leases are included in the table above. These individual operating lease agreements under the master lease provide for guarantees of the equipment's residual value at the end of their lease terms for up to a maximum of $4.1 million. At May 30, 2010, the fair value of the lease guarantees was $0.1 million and is included in other non-current liabilities.
Contingencies  Legal Proceedings
Environmental Matters
We have been named to the National Priorities List for our Santa Clara, California, site and we have completed a remedial investigation/feasibility study with the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), acting as an agent for the EPA. We have agreed in principle with the RWQCB on a site remediation plan and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site. In addition to the Santa Clara site, we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party (PRP) by international, federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement. These designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement. These claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions. In many cases, the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified, and, claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us. We accrue costs associated with environmental matters when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The amount of all environmental charges to earnings, including charges for the Santa Clara site remediation, (excluding potential reimbursements from insurance coverage), were not material during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.
We have also retained responsibility for environmental matters connected with businesses we sold in fiscal 1996 and 1997. To date, the costs associated with the liabilities we have retained in these dispositions have not been material and there have been no related legal proceedings.
 
Tax Matters
Our federal tax returns for fiscal 2007 through 2009 are currently under examination by the IRS. In addition, the IRS will audit our amended federal tax returns for fiscal 2005 and 2006. Several U.S. state taxing jurisdictions are examining our state tax returns for fiscal 2001 through 2005. During fiscal 2010, the state of California closed its audits of fiscal years up through fiscal 2000, which resulted in an immaterial adjustment. Internationally, tax authorities from several foreign jurisdictions are also examining our tax returns. We believe we have made adequate tax payments and/or accrued adequate amounts of reserves such that the outcomes of these audits will have no material adverse effects on our financial statements.
Other Matters
In May 2008, eTool Development, Inc. and eTool Patent Holdings Corporation (collectively eTool) brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that our WEBENCH online design tools infringe an eTool patent and seeking an injunction and unspecified amounts of monetary damages (trebled because of the alleged willful infringement), attorneys' fees and costs. In December 2008, eTool amended the complaint and counterclaims to include our SOLUTIONS online tool in its allegations of infringement of the eTool patent. We filed an answer to the amended complaint and counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the patent. On February 27, 2009, the Court held a scheduling conference setting a claim construction hearing for August 2011 and a jury trial for January 2012. eTool served its infringement contentions in March 2009 and we served our invalidity contentions in May 2009. Both parties exchanged initial disclosures on May 29, 2009. The discovery phase of the case is now open and ongoing. In February 2010, we filed our reexamination petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), seeking a determination that the 919 patent is invalid. On March 15, 2010, the PTO issued a communication granting our reexamination petition. The proceeding is ongoing. On June 8, 2010, eTool filed its second amended complaint removing the infringement allegations against our SOLUTIONS online tool. We answered eTool's second amended complaint on June 25, 2010. We intend to contest the case through all available means.
inter partes
inter partes
inter partes
We are currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings, including those noted above. We make provisions for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have made adequate provisions for potential liability in litigation matters. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on the information that is currently available to us, we believe that the ultimate outcome of litigation matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable. If an unfavorable ruling or outcome were to occur, there is a possibility of a material adverse effect on results of operations or our financial position.
Contingencies  Other
In connection with our past divestitures, we have routinely provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as environmental, tax, product and employee liabilities. We also routinely include intellectual property indemnification provisions in our terms of sale, development agreements and technology licenses with third parties. Since maximum obligations are not explicitly stated in these indemnification provisions, the potential amount of future maximum payments cannot be reasonably estimated. To date we have incurred minimal losses associated with these indemnification obligations and as a result, we have not recorded any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.
Note 16. Segment and Geographic Information
We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products, most of which are analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. We are organized by various product line business units. For segment reporting purposes, each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under ASC Topic 280, "Segment Reporting," and our Chief Executive Officer is considered the chief operating decision-maker. Business units that have similarities, including economic characteristics, underlying technology, markets and customers, are aggregated into larger segments. For fiscal 2010, our Analog segment, which accounted for 94 percent of net sales, is the only operating segment that meets the criteria of a reportable segment. Operating segments that do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment are combined under "All Others."
Product line business units that make up the Analog segment include high speed products, precision signal path, and power management which includes three different business units (infrastructure power, mobile devices power and
 
performance power products). These business units represent the core analog focus and receive the majority of our research and development investment funds. The Analog segment is focused on utilizing our analog and mixed-signal design expertise to develop high-performance building blocks and integrated solutions aimed at end markets, such as wireless handsets (including smart phones) and other portable devices, and at applications for broader markets, such as industrial and medical, automotive, network infrastructure and photovoltaic systems.
Aside from these operating segments, our corporate structure in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 also included the centralized Worldwide Marketing and Sales Group, the Key Market Segments Group, the Technology Development Group, the Manufacturing Operations Group, and the Corporate Group. Certain expenses of these groups are allocated to the operating segments and are included in their segment operating results.
With the exception of the allocation of certain expenses, the significant accounting policies and practices used to prepare the consolidated financial statements as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements are generally followed in measuring the sales, segment income or loss and determination of assets for each reportable segment. We allocate certain expenses associated with centralized manufacturing, selling, marketing and general administration to operating segments based on either the percentage of net trade sales for each operating segment to total net trade sales or headcount, as appropriate. Certain R&D expenses primarily associated with centralized activities such as process development are allocated to operating segments based on the percentage of dedicated R&D expenses for each operating segment to total dedicated R&D expenses.
 
The following table presents specified amounts included in the measure of segment operating results or the determination of segment assets:
 
The information in the table above for fiscal 2009 and 2008 has been reclassified to present segment information based on the structure of our operating segments in fiscal 2010. Sales for the category "All Others," includes sales from non-analog business units that are no longer a part of our core focus, as well as some sales generated from foundry and contract service arrangements.
Total assets for the Analog segment consist only of those assets that are specifically dedicated to an operating segment and include inventories, equipment, equity investments, goodwill and amortizable intangibles assets. Depreciation and amortization presented for each segment include only such charges on dedicated segment assets. Similarly, share-based compensation expense presented for each segment includes only such charges related to employees who directly support the operating segments. The measurement of segment profit and loss includes an allocation of depreciation expense for shared manufacturing facilities and share-based compensation expense associated with direct labor contained in the standard cost of product for each segment.
 
Our revenues from external customers are derived from the sales of semiconductor product and engineering-related services. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, sales from engineering-related services were immaterial and are included with semiconductor product sales. Our semiconductor product sales consist of integrated circuit components and are considered a group of similar products.
Net sales to major customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:
 
 
Sales to the distributors included above are mostly for our Analog segment products, but also include some sales for our other operating segment products. Sales to Nokia are primarily for our Analog segment products.
We operate our marketing and sales activities in four main geographic regions that include the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and Japan. Total sales by geographical area include sales to unaffiliated customers and inter-geographic transfers, which are based on standard cost. To control costs, a substantial portion of our products are transported between the Americas, Asia Pacific region and Europe while in the process of being manufactured and sold. In the information presented below, we have excluded these inter-geographic transfers.
The following tables provide geographic sales and asset information by major countries within the main geographic areas:

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The quoted market prices are as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape. At May 30, 2010, there were approximately 4,800 record holders of common stock. The graph showing the performance of our stock over the last five years can be found in Item 5 of this Form 10-K.
 
 
 
Our customers do not have contractual rights to return product to us except under customary warranty provisions. The majority of returns and allowances are related to the price adjustment programs we have with distributors, none of which involve return of product. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs, including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume, price protection for inventory and scrap allowances. The revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs. Our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family, inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, and other related factors. Our history of actual credits granted in connection with the allowance programs has been consistent with the reserves we have recorded.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Operations
We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products, most of which are analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Our goal is to be the premier provider of high-performance energy-efficient analog and mixed-signal solutions. These solutions are marketed under our PowerWise brand. Energy-efficiency is our overarching theme, and our PowerWise products enable systems that consume less power, extend battery life and generate less heat. Our leading-edge products include power management circuits and sub-systems, audio and operational amplifiers, communication interface products and data conversion solutions.
Basis of Presentation
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of National Semiconductor Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. You should not expect interim results of operations necessarily to be indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2010.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements  a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force." In the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) or other third party evidence (TPE) of the selling price for the deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement, this ASU requires companies to use an estimated selling price (ESP) for the individual deliverables. Companies are to apply the relative-selling price model for allocating an arrangement's total consideration to its individual elements. Under this model, the ESP is used for both the delivered and undelivered elements that do not have VSOE or TPE of the selling price. The FASB also issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Software (Topic 985)  Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements," which excludes the software from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software contained in the tangible product is essential to the tangible product's functionality. Both ASUs are effective for us beginning in our fiscal 2012, with earlier application permitted. We elected to early adopt the accounting requirements in these ASUs during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Their adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Earnings Per Share
A reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share follows:
 
Anti-dilutive potential common shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 and 2010, the effect of these shares was anti-dilutive because the exercise price of the related stock options exceeded the average market price during the period. Shares related to outstanding stock options at February 27, 2011 that were anti-dilutive could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.
Share-based Compensation
Share-based compensation expense included in operating results is presented in the following table:
 
 
The fair value of share-based awards to employees in connection with equity compensation plans was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that used the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
We did not grant any stock options during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $4.01 per share. The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $3.82 and $4.01 per share, respectively. There were no rights granted under the stock purchase plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and 2010. The weighted-average fair value of rights granted under the stock purchase plan was $3.41 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and $4.08 per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
For all options granted after December 31, 2007, we determine expected life based on historical stock option exercise experience for the last four years, adjusted for our expectation of future exercise activity. For options granted prior to January 1, 2008, we use the simplified method specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 to determine the expected life of stock options. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility, as management has determined that implied volatility better reflects the market's expectation of future volatility than historical volatility, and is determined based on our traded options, which are actively traded on several exchanges. We derive the implied volatility using the closing prices of traded options during a period that closely matches the timing of the option grant for the stock option and stock purchase plans. The traded options selected for our measurement for the stock option and stock purchase plans are near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the option grants and have terms ranging from one to two years. The risk-free interest rate is based upon interest rates that match the expected life of the outstanding options under our employee stock option plans and the expected life of the purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan. The dividend yield is based on recent history and our expectation of dividend payouts.
Note 2. Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability would occur and the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We measure fair value to record our cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and the deferred compensation plan assets. The measurement of fair value for our long-term debt is used to provide disclosure under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 825, "Financial Instruments." We do not measure fair value to record the carrying value of our long-term debt, except for the debt associated with our interest rate swap that was subject to hedge accounting (See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Our non-financial assets subject to fair value measurements include goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, which are measured and recorded at fair value in the period they are acquired or determined to be impaired, and property, plant and equipment, which is measured and recorded at fair value in the period it is determined to be impaired.
The FASB guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
 
Level 1 assets include our investments in institutional money-market funds that are classified as cash equivalents and the investment funds of the deferred compensation plan assets where the respective financial instruments are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of activity.
 
Level 2 assets and liabilities include our investments in commercial paper that are classified as cash equivalents and our senior notes that represent long-term debt instruments that are less actively traded in the market, but where quoted market prices exist for similar instruments that are actively traded, and derivative financial instruments which are based on observable inputs or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the derivative financial instrument.
 
Level 3 assets include goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment where we determine fair value based on unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances and take into consideration assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:
 
There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 financial assets and liabilities in fiscal 2011 and 2010.
 
The institutional money-market funds and the various investment funds within our deferred compensation plan assets are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value. We determine fair value of our commercial paper by obtaining non-binding market prices from our broker on the last day of the quarter. We then corroborate these market prices by comparison to quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts represents the present value difference between the stated forward contract rate and the current market forward rate at settlement. The fair value of foreign currency options contracts represents the probable weighted net amount we would expect to receive at maturity. The fair value of the interest rate swap was based on a commonly used valuation model that included significant observable inputs, such as interest rate yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the six-month LIBOR interest rates, as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties and our own nonperformance risk.
Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include the following:
 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, a portion of our assets held for sale was written down to its fair value of $17.6 million less cost to sell of $0.7 million. As a result we recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million, which is further discussed in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of those assets held for sale is based on market prices of similar assets using a market approach that includes observable inputs.
The fair value of our long-term debt (including the current portion) at February 27, 2011 was $1,086.1 million. The fair value measurements for our long-term debt instruments take into consideration credit rating changes, equity price movements, interest rate changes and other economic variables.
Note 3. Derivative Financial Instruments
The objective of our foreign exchange risk management policy is to preserve the U.S. dollar value of after-tax cash inflow in relation to non-U.S. dollar currency movements. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that is inherent in orders, sales, cost of sales, expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forwards and purchased options, to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are matched at inception to the related foreign currency exposures that are being hedged. Exposures which are hedged include sales by subsidiaries, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency hedges typically mature within six months.
Derivative instruments used to hedge exposures to variability in expected future foreign denominated cash flows are not designated as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are immediately recorded in earnings.
We had an interest rate swap agreement that managed our exposure to interest rate changes from our $250 million senior unsecured notes due April 2015 (see below). The agreement effectively converted the fixed interest rate of the $250 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes to a floating interest rate. We designated this swap agreement as a fair value hedge and recognized the changes in the fair value of both the swap and the related debt, which we recorded as gains or losses on derivative instrument in fair value hedge included in other non-operating income, net.
 
The following table provides information about gains (losses) associated with our derivative financial instruments:
 
In September 2010, we liquidated our interest rate swap for which we received proceeds of $16.1 million including accrued interest through the liquidation date. Upon the date of liquidation, we measured the fair value of both the swap and the related debt, which resulted in a net gain on derivative instrument in fair value hedge of $0.3 million. We also incurred a loss of $0.7 million due to derecognition of the fair value hedge in connection with the liquidation of the interest rate swap. These amounts are included in other non-operating income, net for the first nine months of fiscal 2011. The accumulated fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the senior unsecured notes will be amortized over the remaining term of the debt on an effective yield basis and will be recorded as a reduction of interest expense.
Fair Value and Notional Principal of Derivative Financial Instruments
The notional principal amounts for derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of February 27, 2011 and May 30, 2010, and does not represent the amount of the exposure to credit or market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information at February 27, 2011 and May 30, 2010. The table below shows the fair value and notional principal of our derivative financial instruments.

We recorded total net charges for severance and restructuring expenses of $8.2 million in the third quarter and $24.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. The following table provides additional detail related to these expenses:
 
In connection with exit activities related to the realignment of certain product line business units originally announced in May 2010, we recorded charges of $0.2 million in the third quarter and $3.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. These amounts include $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 for severance payments to an employee who was terminated in the quarter due to related exit activities and a total of $1.5 million for severance expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. We also recorded $0.4 million for other exit-related costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 in connection with two leased facilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to discontinue the development of a product which was originally acquired with the purchase of ActSolar, Inc. in fiscal 2009. As a result, the charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 include a $1.2 million charge to write off the intangible asset and certain equipment related to the development project that is no longer used. Remaining activities related to the product line business realignment are now expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2011 and total cumulative charges are expected to be approximately $5 million to $6 million. Total cumulative charges since this action was originally announced in fiscal 2010 through February 27, 2011 were $4.8 million, which includes an additional $1.7 million for severance payments recorded in fiscal 2010.
 
In connection with the workforce reduction and plant closures announced in March 2009, we recorded a total net charge of $8.0 million in the third quarter and $21.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. These amounts include other exit-related costs of $1.9 million in the third quarter and $13.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 associated with the closure and transfer activities that occurred at our manufacturing sites in Texas and China during the same periods. These amounts also include severance costs of $0.1 million in the third quarter and $0.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. We recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 to reduce the carrying value of one of the manufacturing sites that is held for sale since the industrial real estate market in its location has declined. In addition, we previously recorded a $0.8 million charge to write off certain Texas building improvements that were removed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $2.0 million charge to write off certain Texas equipment previously classified as held for sale that remained unsold after completing a final public sale of the equipment in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. As a result, total charges for the impairment of property, plant and equipment were $8.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. Partially offsetting the charges discussed above for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was a $0.1 million recovery to reduce accrued severance upon redeploying an employee from Texas to another location and a $0.8 million gain on the sale of certain Texas equipment. Since these net charges relate to actions announced in fiscal 2009, total cumulative net charges in fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 through February 27, 2011 for these actions are presented in the following table:
 
In fiscal 2010 we ceased production activity in both China and Texas. Remaining activities associated with the closures of the China and Texas manufacturing facilities were substantially completed by the end of November 2010. Until these facilities are both sold, we expect to incur ongoing maintenance expenses of less than $1 million each quarter.
Since production activity in both China and Texas has ceased, we are actively engaged in locating buyers to purchase each of these manufacturing facilities and the existing machinery and equipment located in these facilities. As a result, all of the China and Texas plant assets have been classified as held for sale. As of February 27, 2011, the total carrying value of assets held for sale was $33.9 million and is reported in other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. We have ceased depreciation on these assets and now measure the carrying value at the lower of historical net book value or fair value (less cost to sell). As discussed above, we recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 to reduce the carrying value of one of our facilities that is held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell.During the first nine months of fiscal 2011, activity related to assets held for sale included the sale of certain Texas equipment with a carrying value of $2.6 million and the write off of certain Texas building improvements and equipment with a carrying value of $2.8 million. In addition, certain Texas equipment with a carrying value of $0.5 million (approximating fair value) was transferred to our manufacturing facility in Maine and reclassified as held and used.
The following table provides a summary of the activities through the first nine months of fiscal 2011 related to severance and restructuring costs included in accrued liabilities:
 
 
During the first nine months of fiscal 2011 we paid severance to 197 employees in connection with exit activities as part of the business unit realignment announced in May 2010 and the plant closures. Payments for other exit-related costs were primarily for expenses associated with closure and transfer activities incurred in connection with the closures of our manufacturing facilities in Texas and China.
The balances at February 27, 2011 represent remaining estimated costs for activities that have occurred, but have yet to be paid, as a result of the business unit realignment and the manufacturing plant closures. Payments for the remaining severance balances of $0.7 million related to the business unit realignment and $2.4 million related to the plant closures that have been substantially completed are expected to be paid over the next quarter. Severance amounts are generally paid 30-60 days after the employee's actual departure date or may be deferred until the beginning of the calendar year after their departure date. Other exit-related costs primarily relate to expenses associated with closure and transfer activities occurring in these manufacturing locations.
Note 7. Acquisition
In June 2010, we acquired substantially all of the assets of GTronix Inc. (GTronix), a fabless semiconductor company based in Fremont, California. GTronix's proprietary analog technology provides very low-power solutions for noise cancellation in mobile applications such as wireless handsets and audio accessories. The acquisition of GTronix's assets is intended to expand our existing audio portfolio. In addition, GTronix technology has potential for other broader applications in which low-power analog signal processing is important.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with a purchase price of $4.5 million for the GTronix's assets. The acquired assets constitute a business under FASB guidance and included primarily amortizable intangible assets, inventory and equipment. No liabilities were assumed in the transaction. The purchase price was allocated as follows:
 
Goodwill from this acquisition is included in our Analog segment and it primarily represents the expected value of future technologies that have yet to be determined. Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations related to this acquisition have not been presented since GTronix's operating results up to the date of acquisition were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
Note 8. Goodwill
The following table presents goodwill by reportable segments:
 
Note 9. Debt
Our multicurrency credit agreement with a bank was renewed and amended in October 2010 to provide up to $10 million for multicurrency loans, letters of credit and standby letters of credit. The agreement contains restrictive covenants, conditions and default provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of February 27, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the agreement. The agreement will expire in October 2011.
In October 2010, we also amended an existing credit agreement with a bank to extend the due date of our unsecured promissory note denominated in Japanese yen (2,408,750,000). Under the terms of the agreement, the promissory note will become due in November 2013 and all other terms under the agreement remain the same.
In June 2010, we repaid in full the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes that became due June 2010. The total amount of the repayment was $250.3 million, which included the aggregate principal amount outstanding and accrued interest through the repayment date.
 
Note 10. Income Taxes
Income tax expense of $20.3 million in the third quarter and $87.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was higher than the $19.2 million in the third quarter and the $42.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2010 primarily because of higher U.S. income in fiscal 2011. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted, which extended most expiring tax provisions, including the extension of the federal research and development tax credit through December 2011. As a result, income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 includes a tax benefit arising from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit that was partially offset by certain discrete tax expenses that arose in the same quarter.
Note 11. Retirement and Pension Plans
Net periodic pension costs for our defined benefit pension plans maintained in the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan are presented in the following table:
 
Total contributions paid to these plans during fiscal 2011 were $0.4 million in the third quarter and $1.2 million in the first nine months. Total contributions paid to these plans during fiscal 2010 were $0.4 million in the third quarter and $1.4 million in the first nine months. We currently expect our total fiscal 2011 contribution to these plans to be approximately $6 million.
Note 12. Shareholders' Equity
Stock Repurchase Programs
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in connection with the $500 million stock repurchase program we announced in June 2007. Under this program, we had a balance of $127.4 million remaining available for future stock repurchases as of February 27, 2011. We do not have any plans to terminate the program prior to its completion, and there is no expiration date for this repurchase program.
Dividends
We paid cash dividends of $24.2 million ($0.10 per outstanding share of common stock) in the third quarter and a total of $67.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. We paid cash dividends of $19.1 million ($0.08 per outstanding share of common stock) in the third quarter and a total of $56.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
On March 10, 2011 we announced that our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on April 11, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 21, 2011.
Note 13. Share-based Compensation Plans
Stock Option Plans
In fiscal 2011 to date, stock options were granted only from the 2009 Incentive Award Plan (the 2009 Plan), while stock options that were exercised, forfeited and expired represent stock options that were granted under the 2009 Plan and our former equity plans (the 1977 Stock Option Plan, the 2007 Employee Equity Plan (EEP), the 2005 Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP) and the Executive Officer Stock Option Plan). The following table summarizes the activity during the first nine months of fiscal 2011 of common stock shares related to stock options granted under all of our equity plans (excluding the director stock option plan):
 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2011 was $3.5 million in the third quarter and $7.5 million in the first nine months. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2010 was $1.0 million in the third quarter and $7.1 million in the first nine months. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants as of February 27, 2011 was $14.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
The following table provides additional information about total options outstanding under our stock option plans (excluding the director stock option plan) at February 27, 2011:
 
Other Stock Plans
In fiscal 2011 to date, restricted stock shares and restricted stock units were granted from the 2009 Plan, while restricted stock shares and restricted stock units that were vested or forfeited represent restricted stock awards that were granted under the 2009 Plan and the former EEP and restricted stock plan. The following table provides a summary of activity during the first nine months of fiscal 2011 for grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units under the 2009 Plan, the EEP and the restricted stock plan (excluding units granted with performance based restrictions):
 
The total fair value of restricted shares that vested in fiscal 2011 was $4.2 million in the third quarter and $10.5 million in the first nine months. The total fair value of restricted shares that vested in fiscal 2010 was $0.3 million in the third quarter and $1.2 million in the first nine months. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock shares and restricted stock units outstanding as of February 27, 2011 was $31.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.
Under the director stock plan, we granted 104,626 shares of common stock to our directors in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. Total unrecognized compensation cost as of February 27, 2011 related to non-vested awards granted under the plan was $0.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
With respect to performance share units under the EOEP, no shares were issued in July 2010 upon completion of the fourth two-year performance period because minimum performance thresholds were not achieved. Targets for a fifth two-year performance period that were established in July 2009 will be measured after the end of fiscal 2011. Targets for a one-year performance period that were also established in July 2009, were measured after the end of fiscal 2010, but require a two-year vesting period. Targets for a sixth two-year performance period were established in June 2010 and will be measured after the end of fiscal 2012. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance share units as of February 27, 2011 was $5.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.8 year.
On November 29, 2010, we paid a one-time cash payment of an aggregate of $14.6 million to our executive officers in connection with the special retention incentive program approved by our Compensation Committee in fiscal 2009. To receive the payment, the officer
 
must have been providing services to the company on the payment date. The amount of each cash award was determined based upon the average daily closing price of our common stock for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 ended November 28, 2010, which was $13.06 per share.
Note 14. Segment Information
The following table present information related to our reportable segments:
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we combined the activities of the former key market segments group together with certain emerging product lines that were previously a part of two separate power business units to form a new business unit called the strategic growth markets business unit. This business unit will concentrate its efforts on selected high-growth emerging markets that represent promising opportunities to the company. The remaining product lines that were previously a part of the former performance power products business unit were combined with the remaining product lines within the infrastructure power business unit and were renamed the power products business unit. As a result, the Analog segment now comprises five operating segments which include the high-speed products, mobile devices power, power products, precision signal path and strategic growth markets business units. The information in the table above for the third quarter and first nine months ended February 28, 2010 has been reclassified to present segment information based on the structure of our operating segments in fiscal 2011.
Operating segments that do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment are combined under the category "All Others." Sales for the category "All Others" include sales of products from non-analog business units that are no longer a part of our core focus, as well as sales generated from foundry and contract service arrangements.
Note 15. Contingencies  Legal Proceedings
Environmental Matters
We have been named to the National Priorities List for our Santa Clara, California, site and we have completed a remedial investigation/feasibility study with the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), acting as an agent for the EPA. We have agreed in principle with the RWQCB on a site remediation plan and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site. In addition to the Santa Clara site, we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party (PRP) by international, federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement. These designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement. These claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions. In many cases, the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified, and, claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us. We accrue costs associated with environmental matters when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The amount of all environmental charges to earnings, including charges for the Santa Clara site remediation, (excluding potential reimbursements from insurance coverage), were not material during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011.
 
We have also retained responsibility for environmental matters connected with businesses we sold in fiscal 1996 and 1997. To date, the costs associated with the liabilities we have retained in these dispositions have not been material and there have been no related legal proceedings.
Tax Matters
The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining our federal tax returns for fiscal 2007 through 2009, as well as our amended federal tax returns for fiscal 2005 and 2006. Several U.S. state taxing jurisdictions are examining our state tax returns for fiscal 2001 through 2005. During fiscal 2010, the state of California closed its audits of fiscal years up through fiscal 2000, which resulted in an immaterial adjustment. Internationally, tax authorities from several foreign jurisdictions are also examining our tax returns. We believe we have made adequate tax payments and/or accrued adequate amounts of reserves such that the outcomes of these audits will have no material adverse effects on our financial statements.
Other Matters
In May 2008, eTool Development, Inc. and eTool Patent Holdings Corporation (collectively eTool) brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that our WEBENCH online design tools infringe an eTool patent and seeking an injunction and unspecified amounts of monetary damages (trebled because of the alleged willful infringement), attorneys' fees and costs. In December 2008, eTool amended the complaint and counterclaims to include our SOLUTIONS online tool in its allegations of infringement of the eTool patent. We filed an answer to the amended complaint and counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the patent. On February 27, 2009, the Court held a scheduling conference setting a claim construction hearing for August 2011 and a jury trial for January 2012. eTool served its infringement contentions in March 2009 and we served our invalidity contentions in May 2009. Both parties exchanged initial disclosures on May 29, 2009. The discovery phase of the case is now open and ongoing. In February 2010, we filed our reexamination petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), seeking a determination that the 919 patent is invalid. On March 15, 2010, the PTO issued a communication granting our reexamination petition. The proceeding is ongoing. On June 8, 2010, eTool filed its second amended complaint removing the infringement allegations against our SOLUTIONS online tool. We answered eTool's second amended complaint on June 25, 2010. On February 7, 2011, we filed an amended answer, defenses and counterclaims that asserted an inequitable conduct defense and counterclaim. We intend to contest the case through all available means. We are currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may be incurred as a result of this proceeding.
inter partes
inter partes
inter partes
We are currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings, including those noted above. We make provisions for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have made adequate provisions for potential liability in litigation matters. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on the information that is currently available to us, we believe that the ultimate outcome of litigation matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable. If an unfavorable ruling or outcome were to occur, there is a possibility of a material adverse effect on results of operations or our financial position.
Contingencies  Other
In connection with our past divestitures, we have routinely provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as environmental, tax, product and employee liabilities. We also routinely include intellectual property indemnification provisions in our terms of sale, development agreements and technology licenses with third parties. Since maximum obligations are not explicitly stated in these indemnification provisions, the potential amount of future maximum payments cannot be reasonably estimated. To date we have incurred minimal losses associated with these indemnification obligations and as a result, we have not recorded any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.
 

Exhibit 99.3
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the planned acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) by Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI).
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of TI and National, which are incorporated by reference into this current report on Form 8-K. In preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, certain historical financial information for National, which has a fiscal year end that ends on the last Sunday of May, was recast to a reportable period comparable to TI (TI reports on a calendar year basis): to the results for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2010, we added the results for the six months ended November 28, 2010 and subtracted the results for the six months ended November 27, 2009. The other unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on historical financial statements that are within 93 days of TI calendar reporting periods and so no further recasting of National's financial statements was required. In addition certain reclassifications were made to the reported financial information of National to conform to the reporting classifications of TI.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, give effect to the acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the acquisition as if it had been completed on March 31, 2011.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the acquisition, (2) factually supportable and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of TI and National. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any operating efficiencies, cost savings or revenue enhancements that may be achieved by the combined companies. In addition, certain nonrecurring expenses expected to be incurred within the first twelve months after the acquisition are also not reflected in the pro forma statements.
The pro forma adjustments are based on preliminary information available as of the date of this current report on Form 8-K. Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes. These preliminary assumptions and estimates are subject to change as TI finalizes the valuations of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed in connection with its acquisition of National. Such final valuations are dependent upon procedures and other studies that have yet to commence; therefore the final amounts recorded at the closing date of the acquisition may differ significantly from the information presented herein.
Upon consummation of the acquisition, TI will review National's accounting policies to determine if it may be necessary to harmonize any differences in policies. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not assume any differences in accounting policies.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations and financial position would have been had the acquisition taken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of: TI included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011; and National included in this current report on Form 8-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2010 and for the three and nine months ended February 27, 2011.

A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time.
It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about May 23, 2011, which is the fifth business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as "T+5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisors.

thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VI under the first or second paragraphs hereof is unavailable in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VI were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VI are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VI and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any
 
person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
In further consideration of the agreements of the Company herein contained, each Underwriter severally covenants as follows:
(a) Not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(b) Not to use, refer to or distribute any free writing prospectus except (i) a free writing prospectus that (A) is not an issuer free writing prospectus and (B) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Offered Securities or the offering thereof, which information is limited to the categories of terms referenced on Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement or otherwise permitted under Rule 134 of the Securities Act, (ii) a free writing prospectus as shall be agreed in writing with the Company that is not distributed, used or referred to by such Underwriter in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination (unless the Company consents in writing to such dissemination) or (iii) a free writing prospectus identified in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement as forming part of the Time of Sale Prospectus.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Manager's absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the Applicable Time and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange or in the U.S. over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or a severe deterioration in U.S. financial markets or any other calamity or crisis that is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clause (a)(iv), such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the Manager's judgment, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and this Agreement. Any such termination of this Agreement shall be without liability on the part of any Manager or on the part of the Company except as stated in Article IX.
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the
 
aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, none of the Underwriters is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section VI hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(iv) all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Issuer of the Securities have been complied with,
and covering such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.

The Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section with respect to the Securities of a series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to the nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary."

Execution of Securities
In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Security so signed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
Section 2.06. . Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

exchange or conversion of such Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names Outstanding Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) for the Securities of any series shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of such series established as contemplated by Section 2.03, or, if no such date is so established, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the 15th day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the 15th day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
Section 2.08. . The Issuer will keep at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.02 for each series of Securities a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will provide for the registration of Securities of such series and the registration of transfer of Securities of such series. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.

Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.02, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder thereof, Securities of any series (except a Global Security) may be exchanged for a Security or Securities of such series having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.02 and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.04, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to Section 2.03 that the Securities of such series be represented by a Global Security shall no longer be effective and the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing the Securities of such series, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Securities. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate for
 
the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of the same series in definitive registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
(i) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
(ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive registered form, in authorized denominations, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save
. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof and in the case of mutilation or defacement shall surrender the Security to the Trustee.
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full, or is being surrendered for conversion in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may, instead of issuing a substitute Security (with the Holder's consent, in the case of convertible Securities), pay or authorize the payment of the same or convert, or authorize conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Security of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.10All Securities surrendered for exchange for Securities of the same series or for payment, redemption, registration of transfer, conversion or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities held by it and deliver a certificate of disposition to the Issuer. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Debt represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
. Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof.
 
Section 2.11Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable in any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.02 and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series having authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series, unless the benefits of the temporary Securities are limited pursuant to Section 2.03.

If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal, State or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

Section 6.10(a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders of then Outstanding Securities of each series affected at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security register.

Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or

(iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;

(d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.11.

Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06.
. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee.
If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.

Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, the Issuer shall mail notice thereof to the Holders of Securities of each series affected, by mailing such notice to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Issuer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Issuer.
Section 6.12Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder;, that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee.
provided
In case, at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have;, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
provided

become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Section 7.02Subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his or her agent or proxy may be proved in the following manner:
. Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities.
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of the person executing the same.
(b) The ownership of such Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.
(c) If the Issuer shall solicit from the Holders of Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Issuer may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Securities entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Issuer shall have no obligation to do so. Notice of such record date shall be given to the Trustee as soon as practicable after the time that the record date has been fixed. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Securities for the purposes of determining whether Holders of Securities of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date;, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders of Securities on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
provided
Section 7.03The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be

All such payments so made to any such Person, or upon his or her order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable.
Section 7.04In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described Persons; and, subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the Holder of any Security

shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.

provided
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
Upon the request of the Issuer, accompanied by a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Issuer authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.01, the Trustee shall join with the Issuer in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.

Section 12.01The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified, as contemplated by Section 2.03 for Securities of such series.
. Applicability of Article.
Section 12.02Notice of redemption to the Holders of Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security register. Any notice which is given in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
. Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions.
 
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue and shall also specify, if applicable, the conversion price then in effect and the date on which the right to convert such Securities or the portions thereof to be redeemed will expire. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
On or before the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.04) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption (other than those theretofore surrendered for conversion into Common Stock) at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If any Security called for redemption is converted pursuant hereto, any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall be paid to the Issuer upon the Issuer's request, or, if then held by the Issuer, shall be discharged from such trust. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 70 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter time period shall be acceptable to the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05) stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Issuer prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officers' Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of
 
any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. If any Security selected for partial redemption is surrendered for conversion after such selection, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Upon any redemption of less than all the Securities, the Issuer and the Trustee may treat as Outstanding Securities surrendered for conversion during the period of 15 days next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption, and need not treat as Outstanding any Security authenticated and delivered during such period in exchange for the unconverted portion of any Security converted in part during such period.
Section 12.03If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and, except as provided in Sections 6.05 and 10.04, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be convertible into Common Stock, if applicable, and to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption;, that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.03 and 2.07 hereof.
. Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
provided
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security and, if applicable, such Security shall remain convertible into Common Stock until the principal of such Security shall have been paid or duly provided for.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
 
Section 12.04Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.

. Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds.

sinking fund payment date
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 and, if applicable, receive credit for Securities (not previously so credited) converted into Common Stock and so delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the 60th day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.05) (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such
 
series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such Officers' Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officers' Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such 60th day, to deliver such Officers' Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or a lesser sum in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency if the Issuer shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency) or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officers' Certificate as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing), shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.03) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part
 
at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series, shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity. The Issuer's obligation to make a mandatory or optional sinking fund payment shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the sinking fund redemption price allocable to any Securities or portions thereof called for redemption pursuant to the preceding paragraph on any sinking fund payment date and converted into Common Stock;, , if the Trustee is not the conversion agent for the Securities, the Issuer or such conversion agent shall give the Trustee written notice prior to the date fixed for redemption of the principal amount of Securities or portions thereof so converted.
provided
that
On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 5 and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10, or the default cured on or before the 60th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of May 23, 2011.

Attest:
 
 
This is one of the Notes of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: May 23, 2011
 
 
 
Texas Instruments Incorporated (the "") promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum described herein. This Note will be payable on each Interest Payment Date commencing on August 15, 2011, to the person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on the preceding Interest Record Date. Interest payments for this Note shall be the amount of interest accrued from the date of issue or from the last interest payment date to, but excluding, the interest payment date. Interest on this Note will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed.
Issuer
The amount of interest for each day this Note is outstanding (the "") will be calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for that day by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal amount of this Note. The amount of interest to be paid on this Note on any interest payment date will be calculated by adding the daily interest amounts for each day in the interest period.
daily interest amount
This Note will bear interest for each interest period at a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR, as determined by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) for such period, plus 0.18%. Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Issuer of the interest rate for the next interest period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holder of the Note, the Trustee and the Issuer. The interest rate will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
All percentages resulting from these calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one half cent being rounded upwards).
On any Interest Determination Date, USD LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If on an Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m. (London time), or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Trustee will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
 
If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Issuer) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, USD LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, USD LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the rate of USD LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of USD LIBOR for the then current interest period.
Upon request from the Holder of this Note, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate in effect on this Note for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate borne by the Note and on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) to the extent lawful.
For purposes of the foregoing discussion of interest payable on Floating Rate Notes, the following definitions are applicable:
"" means the calculation agent as appointed by Texas Instruments Incorporated, which initially shall be the Trustee.
Calculation Agent
"" with respect to an interest period will be the second London Business Day preceding the first day of the interest period.

A Holder shall register the transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer need not issue, authenticate, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes or portions thereof for a period of fifteen (15) days before the mailing of a notice of redemption, nor need the Issuer register the transfer or exchange of any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes and the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Notes may be amended or supplemented and any existing default or Event of Default or compliance with certain provisions may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of Outstanding Securities (including the Notes) under the Indenture that are affected by such amendment, supplement or waiver (voting together as a single class).

If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (July 25, 2011)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced second-quarter revenue of $3.46 billion, net income of $672 million and earnings per share of 56 cents.
We are pleased with the continued success of the TI portfolio in Analog and Embedded Processing.  Sequential revenue growth was driven by Embedded Processing up 12 percent and Analog up 3 percent, and we believe we again gained market share in both segments, said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and chief executive officer.  In the quarter, we also resumed production ahead of schedule at our Japan factories that were damaged in the earthquake, thanks to excellent work by our teams on the ground.
We expect growth in the third quarter, but because of mixed macroeconomic and market signals we are prepared for a broader-than-normal range of growth possibilities.  We note that production at some computing and consumer manufacturers appears lukewarm even though were heading into the back-to-school and holiday seasons.  At the same time, Asian distributor resales have been strong, demand from our Japanese customers is increasing and our backlog increased in the second quarter.  Weve planned for modest sequential growth in the third quarter, yet are prepared to support higher demand if it materializes.
TIs pending acquisition of National Semiconductor has cleared all antitrust reviews with the exception of China, which is underway.  The company continues to expect the transaction to close before the end of the year.
We look forward to welcoming the people of National Semiconductor and to expanding the portfolio of unique products we can offer our Analog customers, Templeton concluded.
2Q11 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TIs operating profit was negatively impacted by about $50 million due to costs associated with the March earthquake in Japan.  These costs were net of proceeds from ongoing insurance claims and were included in cost of revenue in the companys Other segment.  Costs of $13 million associated with TIs pending acquisition of National Semiconductor also were included in the Other segment.
Operating profit declined from a year ago primarily due to lower gross profit, which declined as a result of the earthquake-related costs, lower factory utilization and lower revenue.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was about even as profit from higher revenue was offset by lower factory utilization, higher earthquake-related costs and higher operating expenses.
 
2Q11 segment results
 
 
* Includes net costs from the earthquake in Japan of about $50 million in the second quarter of 2011 and about $30 million in the first quarter of 2011.  Also, includes acquisition-related costs of $13 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $2 million in the first quarter of 2011.
  
Analog:
(includes high-volume analog & logic, high-performance analog and power management products)
  
Embedded Processing:
(includes digital signal processor and microcontroller catalog products that are sold across a wide variety of markets, as well as application-specific products that are used in communications infrastructure and automotive electronics)
  
Wireless:
(includes
connectivity products, OMAP applications processors and baseband products)
Other:  
(includes
DLP
products, custom ASIC products, calculators and royalties, as well as products sold under transitional supply agreements associated with recently acquired factories)
2Q11 additional financial information
 
 
Outlook
For the third quarter of 2011, TI expects:
TI will update its third-quarter outlook on September 8, 2011.
For the full year of 2011, TI expects approximately the following:
 
 
 
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) on which we pay dividend equivalents is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded from earnings per common share was $10 million, $11 million and $10 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2011, June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in prior periods' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Oct. 24, 2011)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $3.47 billion, net income of $601 million and earnings per share of 51 cents.  EPS includes 9 cents in charges associated with the companys acquisition of National Semiconductor.
The highlight of the third quarter was the completion of the purchase of National Semiconductor.  We welcome the people of National to TI, and together were already taking our combined portfolio of almost 45,000 Analog products to customers all over the world, said Rich Templeton, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Our revenue for the third quarter was higher than we expected though, overall, the quarter was below the seasonal average.  We expect the same in the fourth quarter as economic uncertainty continues to weigh on demand in almost every major market segment in which we operate.  We are well prepared to continue to gain share in our core businesses, no matter the economic conditions.
 
3Q11 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TI closed its acquisition of National Semiconductor on September 23, 2011, and from that date began to consolidate the results of the acquired operations into TIs Analog segment under the name Silicon Valley Analog.  Silicon Valley Analog revenue for that limited time was $18 million and operating profit was $2 million.
Acquisition-related charges of $154 million are included in the Other segments results.  As required by the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, these charges include $7 million in cost of revenue attributable to the fair value write-up of acquired inventory that was sold after the date of acquisition.  The remainder, $147 million, includes restructuring costs, transaction costs, retention bonuses and amortization of intangibles.  In addition, there was a $10 million discrete tax charge.
TIs third-quarter 2011 gross profit and operating profit were negatively impacted by costs associated with lower levels of factory utilization in the quarter as the company lowered production in response to weaker demand, as well as charges for inventory obsolescence on certain custom programs.  These were partially offset by a net benefit resulting from proceeds from ongoing insurance claims associated with the March earthquake in Japan.
Operating profit declined from a year ago primarily due to lower gross profit, as well as acquisition costs.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was lower due to acquisition costs, which were partially offset by lower operating expenses.
3Q11 segment results
 
*  Includes total acquisition-related costs of $154 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $13 million in the second quarter of 2011.  Also includes a net benefit from ongoing insurance claims associated with the earthquake in Japan of $23 million in the third quarter of 2011 and a net cost of $50 million in the second quarter of 2011.
  
Analog:
(includes High Volume Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog, Power Management and Silicon Valley Analog)
  
Embedded Processing:
(includes digital signal processor and microcontroller catalog products that are sold across a wide variety of markets as well as application-specific products that are used in communications infrastructure and automotive electronics)
  
Wireless:
(includes
connectivity products, OMAP applications processors and baseband products)
Other:  
(includes
DLP
products, custom ASIC products, calculators and royalties as well as products sold under transitional supply agreements associated with recently acquired factories)
3Q11 additional financial information
Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2011, TI expects:
EPS will be negatively impacted by about 15 cents from acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter.  These will include about $160 million of acquisition costs and, additionally, about $100 million included in cost of revenue.
TI will update its fourth-quarter outlook on December 8, 2011.
For the full year of 2011, TI expects approximately the following:
 
 
 
 
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), on which we pay dividend equivalents, is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded from earnings per common share was $10 million, $13 million and $10 million for the quarters ending Sept. 30, 2011, Sept. 30, 2010 and June 30, 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Exhibit 99.1
On September 23, 2011 (the Closing Date), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) completed the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) for total cash consideration of approximately $6.5 billion.  The acquisition was financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and $3.5 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2011.  
 
The acquisition is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date, including identifiable intangible assets such as developed technologies, are recorded at their estimated fair value.  The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill, which will not be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test.
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on the latest available historical consolidated financial statements of TI and National, which are incorporated by reference into this current report on Form 8-K/A.  In preparing these statements, certain historical financial information for National, which had a fiscal year that ended on the last Sunday of May, was recast to a reportable period comparable to TIs reporting period (TI reports on a calendar-year basis) and that is within 93 days of TIs calendar reporting periods.  To the results for Nationals fiscal year ended May 30, 2010, we added the results for the six months ended November 28, 2010, and subtracted the results for the six months ended November 27, 2009, to get the statement of income for the twelve months ended November 28, 2010.  To the results for Nationals fiscal year ended May 29, 2011, we subtracted the results for the six months ended November 28, 2010, to get the statement of income for the six months ended May 29, 2011, and to the results for Nationals fiscal year ended May 30, 2010, we subtracted the results for the six months ended November 29, 2009, to get the statement of income for the six months ended May 30, 2010.  In addition, certain reclassifications were made to the reported financial information of National to conform to the reporting classifications of TI.
The unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, give effect to the acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2010, and therefore will differ from actual results reported by TI.  No unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet is presented in this Form 8-K/A as TI has previously filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, which included the financial position of National in its consolidated results.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the acquisition, (2) factually supportable and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of TI and National.  The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect any operating efficiencies, cost savings or revenue enhancements that may be achieved by the combined companies.  In addition, certain nonrecurring expenses expected to be incurred within the first twelve months after the acquisition, such as announced or planned restructuring events, are also not reflected in the pro forma statements.
TI is reviewing Nationals accounting policies to determine whether to harmonize any differences in policies.  These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not assume any material differences in accounting policies.
These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are preliminary and are provided for informational purposes only and are not indicative of what the actual results of operations and financial position would have been had the acquisition taken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the combined companies.  The pro forma adjustments are based on information available as of the date of this current report on Form 8-K/A.  Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes.  These preliminary assumptions and estimates are subject to change as TI finalizes the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with its acquisition of National.  Therefore, final adjustments may differ from the pro forma adjustments presented herein.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of: TI, which are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011; and National, which is included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2011, incorporated by reference in this current report on Form 8-K/A.
 
Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Income
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pro Forma Balance Sheet:
No unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet is presented in this Form 8-K/A, as TI has previously filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, which included the financial position of National in its consolidated results.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2011 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker, Vice President-Investor Relations
Good afternoon and thank you for joining TIs mid-quarter financial update for the fourth quarter of 2011. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TIs current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual, with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyones time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TIs website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TIs results to differ materially from managements current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TIs most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed and lowered our expected ranges for TIs revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.19 billion and $3.33 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.25. The reductions are due to broadly lower demand across a wide range of markets, customers and products, except for wireless applications processors.
Operator, you can now open the line for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question.  Operator?
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And well go first to Uche Orji with UBS.
Thank you very much. Ron, can I just ask you if there are any one-time items that may have impacted the EPS, the way it did relative to revenue downgrade?
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
Uche, are you asking specifically about why it seems like EPS moves...
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
That is correct.
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
...down disproportionate to the revenue?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Yes.
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
I dont know that I would say  actually, there are some one-time items. Let me kind of walk through that transition in general if I can.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
First of all, I would say, mix is unfavorable. And if you think about it, we actually havent talked yet about product areas per se, but what I would say is, were seeing downside versus our expectations in some of the more profitable areas, such as communications infrastructure and some of the catalog, Analog and Embedded Processing product areas while at the same time, were seeing upsides in Wireless. So that mix shift is unfavorable to profit margins, and therefore EPS.
I think also impacting us this quarter is utilization. With revenue down more than we had initially expected, weve also further reduced production loadings to avoid building excess inventory. And so as a result, the underutilization expense will be higher this quarter, therefore further pressuring profit margins compared to last quarter.
And then finally, maybe to the point you had initially asked, we will have higher acquisition-related expenses by about $20 million, which is about $0.01 per share higher than what we had previously expected.
Do you have a follow-on, Uche?
Yes, I do. Thank you very much for that. Now, in terms of the, what changed between the last earnings call and now, obviously we know the macro has continued to weaken, but, in terms of the expectation that we were seeing a bottoming process forming, are you still willing to stand by that comment, even though youve had to lower now? If I had to recalibrate how you view things from here onwards in respect to earlier comments from your last earnings call, how shall I think about it?
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
Okay, so lets start with the, what changed. And again, as I said in my opening remarks, the weakness really is pretty broad-based with the exception of Wireless. So revenue in our Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments is weaker than we had originally expected. If you look at it by end market, communications infrastructure is exceptionally weak. Really thats being driven by UMTS-based systems in North America as those couple of carriers await the outcome of their proposed merger.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Industrial markets also remain weak and I would say, in that space, we have both customers and distributors seemingly pushing component inventory levels just to very low levels. In the computing space, computing overall is down with declines at storage or hard disk drive customers especially exacerbated by the flooding in Thailand. And then consumer product areas, such as televisions and video games, are also weak this quarter.
I mentioned the one bright spot is Wireless, and there, our OMAP revenue is doing very well this quarter. Just as a reminder, were now seeing the benefit of customer programs that have ramped into production using our latest OMAP 4 processor, those customer programs include Samsungs Nexus smartphone, which is our first production program based on Googles Ice Cream Sandwich reference design; Samsungs Galaxy S II smartphone; Motorolas DROID BIONIC and RAZR smartphones; LGs Thrill smartphone with its 3D playback and capture feature; and then most recently, the Amazon Fire tablet and the Barnes & Noble NOOK tablet are both based upon OMAP 4.
And then probably the final end market area that I would mention is automotive, and there, I would describe that sales into automotive applications, we would expect this quarter to be about flat sequentially, which was really about as we had expected.
So thats really what changed, Uche, and thank you for your question. And well move to the next caller.
Operator: Thank you. Well go next to Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Yeah. Thank you. I was wondering if you could add some color if you could on the order linearity. When did  did you see cancellations and push-outs? Or is it just turns didnt come in as expected? And how did orders progress month by month for the quarter so far? Thank you.
<Q  Shawn Webster  Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.>:
Okay. Shawn, I would say, orders, total orders will likely decline some from the third quarter level. This decline includes the seasonal impact from calculators as well as what I would just characterize as lumpiness in baseband. If we just look at our semiconductor products and pull out baseband because of that lumpiness I would say orders there have generally been moving sideways since the significant drop that we saw in the month of July and that we talked about in our October call. Theyve been kind of noisy from a month-to-month basis but the overall trend has been flattish since that period.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?
Yes. Just on inventories, I was wondering if you could hazard a guess if you think your OEM and your distribution customers are burning inventory now or what your visibility there is?
<Q  Shawn Webster  Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.>:
Clearly reducing inventory, so  and I would say really in both fronts. The distribution, we obviously see that data most clearly because we just know what distributors are carrying and they are continuing to take inventories down. I would say they have inventories down to very low levels. Then our belief is that at the OEM customers inventory is being reduced and that in fact were under-shipping those customers production levels.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Okay, Shawn, thank you for your questions. Well move to the next caller.
Operator: Thank you. Well go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thanks for taking my question. Ron, I have actually a longer-term question. In the past year youve added a significant amount of capacity and I understand these are not short-term decisions, but structurally are there actions that you can take to limit downside if macro remains somewhat weak for the next one or two quarters also?
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
You mean specifically in terms of shutting down some of that capacity?
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Yes. Because gross margins have taken a big hit over the last several quarters and Im trying to understand how you can sort of limit downside from here given that the visibility is still somewhat weak out there.
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
Vivek, I would just say thats not in our plans. Obviously there are a lot of options we could do, but especially given our view that were under-shipping demand. Therefore when customers are through with their inventory correction we will be seeing growth even if there is no growth in end demand or inventory replenishment, just as we move back to the customers production levels. So, in that environment and especially considering the low carrying costs of the capacity that we have on board, we have no intention to take any of that, especially the new capacity that weve been bringing on, and doing anything other than fill it up over the course of time.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Did you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Yes, so one more. You mentioned that you were under-shipping demand. So, if you look at historical trends, how long can that situation persist, i.e., is Q4 a bottom? Is Q1 a bottom? How do we get a sense for that, based on what you have seen in similar situations before?
<Q  Vivek Arya  Bank of America Merrill Lynch>:
Okay, sure. And I think this ties somewhat back to the question Uche asked me that I hadnt gotten to specifically, which is, do we still believe that were in this, a bottoming process, the downturn? And the answer is, we do. So, what we look at first of all is, the inventory levels of TI chips at customers and distributors are now very low. And as I said before, we believe were under-shipping demand. So just to reiterate, at some point, customers will have to stop reducing inventory. And when that happens, our revenue will grow as our shipments increase to match the customers production levels, even if theres no growth in end demand or replenishment of inventory.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
And for anybody thats watched this industry cycle over the course of time, you fully understand that once you start to get in that process and customers regain confidence in their own outlook, the next phase is, they will typically then layer in additional inventory as well. The customers historically have not forecast these snap-backs in their demand, and instead they rely on short product lead times to support their increased demand. We think we are very well positioned, both with our inventory as well as our short lead times, to support that inevitable increase in demand. And the other thing that I would point to, which I had mentioned earlier, is just the stability, you might say, in terms of the orders took a step down in the month of July, but they have generally been flattish since that time, which is to us indicative of a bottoming process as well.
I dont have an exact time period, is it this quarter, is it next quarter as to when that snap back could occur. Historically if you look at semiconductor inventory corrections, the response time generally results in a couple of quarters of inventory burn and thats just looking at history, but well have to see what this one holds. I guess I would say that we continue to be encouraged that were in the bottoming process, even though demand was a little weaker than what we had initially expected this quarter.
Okay, Vivek, I believe that was your follow-up. Well move to the next caller please.
Operator: Well go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Great. Thanks, Ron. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess first question is, kind of strategically, with all the strategic fab capacity that you guys have, how do you think about using that in this kind of environment, or maybe even more specifically as things start to bounce back a little bit? Do you try to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing to pick up a little bit of that incremental bump in business that youll see as customers start to normalize the order patterns? Or is it more important you keep pricing pretty steady and try to get the margins back to a more healthy level?
<Q  James Covello  Goldman Sachs & Co.>:
Well margins will return to more normalized levels just as we fill that capacity up. So...
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Sure.
<Q  James Covello  Goldman Sachs & Co.>:
...my view is that probably doesnt tie so much to pricing and just a matter of as we ship more units and therefore amortize that what currently is an underutilization expense, that will do good things for margins.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Youve heard us say many times in the past that for the most part the proprietary product lines that we sell tend to be more spec elastic versus price elastic, so even though were aggressive in pursuing new opportunities, we tend to do it based on the product specifications that were offering, the support package, the applications engineering, as opposed to thinking that somehow if we drop a couple cents off the price, that somehow that would make a difference in the demand that we actually see.
So, again we tend not view price. Although, I will also say we recognize we have to be competitive on price and I think we have a cost structure that allows us to be competitive with any competitor in the world. So, again I think of it this way for our sales people, price is not an excuse for them to lose a piece of business, but nor is it the reason they should win a piece of business. We want to be competitive on price but we win the business based on other considerations.
Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
Yes. This question is specifically about analog. I understand theres a lot of program ramps and design wins and share gains in apps processors, but relative to the analog piece of the business when is it fair for us to measure your share gain story again? In other words, it is always difficult in the downturn to say well, theyre not gaining any share in a downturn, but when is it going to be fair for us to say look at your revenue share of the industry versus your revenue share in a previous period of the cycle and to determine whether the share gain story is playing out?
<Q  James Covello  Goldman Sachs & Co.>:
Jim, I dont know that its not fair to look at it in a downturn. I mean we look at it every quarter. Now, we dont overreact to any particular data point but I think the right way to do it is to sample it quarterly and we ask ourselves the question if theres a quarter where we believe we underperformed we ask ourselves why, and frankly you guys should be asking us why as well. Sample it quarterly. The best way to make this story work over the long-term is to make sure it works every quarter.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
At the same time maybe in a downturn like this you may see more strategic long-term moves in terms of share from the standpoint of gaining position at customers on new design programs and things like that more so than the difference show up in revenue that particular quarter. But again, every quarter absolutely counts.
Okay, Jim, and well move to the next caller. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Well go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Thanks for taking my question. Ron, you said on your October quarter call I believe that you said that the distributor inventories were at six weeks and that was at normal levels. It sounds like theyre lower now. Given that you have pretty clear visibility there can you quantify where they are now? Or at least talk qualitatively about how close they are relative to where they were at the depths of the financial crisis?
<Q  Mark Lipacis  Jefferies & Co., Inc.>:
I dont want to try to quantify where distributors are right now until the end of the quarter, Mark, but I think your interpretation of what were saying is correct that distributor inventory is going down this quarter. In fact, maybe if I can just comment on distribution overall, but make some specific inventory comments. If you just look at resales we would expect resales from distribution to decline compared to the third quarter although at this point, it looks like theyll decline a little less than TIs revenue would overall if we take the National, or the SVA revenue, out just because we only had it for, what, a week last quarter.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Inventory distributors we expect to be down by a double-digit percentage at this point. And again, thats compared with the third quarter. Although Ill also say that that includes inventory returns from a discontinued National distributor. And so the returns from that distributor probably will contribute maybe a couple  few points of the decline in and of itself. But even without that you can see theres a pretty sharp decline in distributor inventory levels.
Just one data point that I saw that Ill pass on almost anecdotally. If you look at inventory for products that we would characterize as specific to the industrial market, just in the last couple of quarters, inventory of those products at distributors has been cut in half. Again the distributors are moving pretty aggressively in terms of reducing inventory. And we all have to watch it, because demand can come back pretty quickly. Again call it the buffer, where we feel comfortable with that, is that inside TI our own inventory we think were pretty well-positioned. So distributors are tightening up somewhat, but we feel that we have enough buffer inside TI to be able to respond as business comes back again.
Do you have a follow-on, Mark?
Yes, please. Thank you. Thanks for that detail. In trying to model the cash flow for next year, I guess I have to believe that front-end CapEx will be at maintenance levels. And then you may or may not have to get back-end equipment. One, is that a fair way to think about it? And two, could you give us a sense of what is like a maintenance level of CapEx?
<Q  Mark Lipacis  Jefferies & Co., Inc.>:
Maybe one way to look at it overall, Mark, is I think historically weve guided that we would expect our CapEx to range somewhere between 5% to 8% of revenue. As you pointed out, with the capacity additions weve made, and over the past couple of years, I think its fair to  we clearly have pulled in capital spending from future years. We dont need to spend a lot on front-end capacity. And therefore, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range, kind of what you said, both maintenance on the front end and then additions to assembly/test.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
But what I would say is, even assembly/test, depending upon growth, as we have more units produced, obviously well need to expand our capacity on assembly/test after weve refilled the existing capacity. And so with utilization both on front end and back end coming back somewhat as weve gone through this downturn, clearly, we have room to grow from current levels before we really even need to spend on back-end capacity to any significance.
All right, Mark, thank you. And well move to the next caller.
Operator: Thank you. Well go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Yes. Thank you. Ron, you quantitatively talked about some of your end markets, but could you also do the same for your regions, please?
<Q  Tore Svanberg  Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.>:
Sure. I guess  and again, this is just based on the first two months of the quarter and extrapolating that through the end of the quarter, but its probably no surprise, Europe is currently our weakest region, followed by Asia and then the U.S. All three of those regions we would expect to be down based upon that two months worth of data. Japan, therefore, is the only region that is tracking to be up sequentially, and thats really as it just continues its post-earthquake recovery.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Yes. You talked about wireless infrastructure being exceptionally weak, and I think you mentioned maybe thats due to some push-outs. Do you have a sense on how those push-outs look like  meaning, is this a quarter or this going to be a multi-quarter push-out?
<Q  Tore Svanberg  Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.>:
I dont know. And I think as I said, it really goes beyond our customers. Its to their customers with the carriers, and I think youre all aware theyre trying to merge and how they spend and where they spend will be different based on whether that merger happens or if for some reason it doesnt happen. And so in the interim, while theyre sorting that out, theyve pretty much stopped spending. So I have no idea how to assess how long that may last, but thats whats currently impacting us there in terms of the decline.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Other carriers are flattish. Some of the programs in India or China that weve all talked about and hoped was maybe going to be ramping are still on hold at this point. But actually whats impacting us in terms of the decline would be those North American carriers that I talked about.
Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Thats the follow-on. I appreciate it. Thank you, Ron.
<Q  Tore Svanberg  Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.>:
Okay. Thank you. Lets go to the next caller, please.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Operator: Well go to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Thanks, Ron. I think the minivans got a flat tire right now. Hey, so one thing that you said today that you guys also said on the conference call about a month and a half ago was that bookings have essentially bottomed for the last couple of months. But clearly the revenue outlook is worse. Im just wondering, what is the difference there? Is this just in your opinion a massive inventory drawdown by the distys? Are your customers telling their demand is worse? Can you just sort of parse that out?
<Q  Chris Danely  JPMorgan Securities LLC>:
Chris, I dont know that I can talk too specifically about customer demand. But our assessment is that this is mostly them taking inventory levels down more than what we had expected as opposed to their demand is significantly weaker than what we had expected.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Yeah. Have you noticed any, I guess, worse performance from the National versus the legacy TI business, i.e., is there any more downside from National, do you think any of this is a result of the merger?
<Q  Chris Danely  JPMorgan Securities LLC>:
No. In fact I would say National, National is declining this quarter but declining about the same as our HPA revenue. And as you know, both of those areas are catalog products sold through distribution. And I would say they both have relatively strong ties to the industrial market, which is weak right now. But I wouldnt say National is disproportionately a factor one way or the other here.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Okay, Chris, thank you. And well move to the next caller.
Operator: Thank you. Well go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
Yeah, Ron. I guess Im trying to figure out a little bit better whats going on with gross margins in the December quarter. So, I guess, can you help me understand? If OpEx dollars are kind of flattish with the old model, that implies sort of a 200 basis point drop. If thats the case, whats utilization versus mix? And were you able to do anything on the OpEx line? Or with the National integration is OpEx kind of a fixed cost this quarter?
<Q  John Pitzer  Credit Suisse (United States)>:
Okay. And, John, let me make sure I understand. Or maybe let me just kind of reiterate what we said even last quarter. OpEx, I think we said in our October call, our view is that OpEx would go up somewhere in the $160 million to $170 million range, and that was a combination of basically having a full quarter of National OpEx in fourth quarter versus only a week of it in the third quarter.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Also I think we talked about some of the  as we adjusted in light of the environment and the forecast some of the variable elements of compensation in the third quarter, there were catch-up accruals basically to adjust the cumulative effect for first half, and that catch-up piece of those lower accruals would not therefore recur in the fourth quarter.
So we said OpEx would be up about $160 million to $170 million. Suffice to say in this environment were going to try to keep a tight control and do better than that, but that, certainly, part of it which is  were not going to be able to do anything about. OpEx will go up by about that amount. Gross margin, I think as you pointed out, will be down, but its also down for the two reasons I talked about: mix and then especially utilization.
And then the only other consideration that I should just remind you about is remember, on cost of revenue theres about $100 million of additional expense in the fourth quarter that I would describe as acquisition related. And that tied to the fair value markup of the inventory that we received from National as part of that acquisition. But those are probably the moving pieces that I can think of to point out at this point.
Did that answer your question, John?
Yeah, it did pretty much, Ron. I guess as a follow-up, midpoint of revenue coming down by about $140 million, I guess I just want to understand. Did Wireless quarter to date on the OMAP coming in better than you originally expected at the beginning of the quarter? Can you help us kind of give the magnitudes? If I ex out OMAP, whats the rest of the business doing versus expectations at the beginning of the quarter?
<Q  John Pitzer  Credit Suisse (United States)>:
Well, yes. OMAP is doing better than expected. I cant quantify it at this point in the quarter, but I will just say OMAP is growing very nicely. And well have more details for you in January. But we expected good growth out of it, and its delivering even better growth. And so other areas are making up the  more than offsetting that growth, and obviously weve taken the overall guidance down. So theyre all doing quite a bit worse than what we had anticipated when we came in. And again, probably for reasons of both macro as well as inventory reduction.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Okay, operator, I believe well take one additional caller, please.
Operator: Well go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Oh, hey, Ron, thanks for sneaking me in. Just an inquiry on the PC-related businesses, you mentioned some Thai flooding impact. Has that proven to be a little bit worse than what the company expected into the quarter, or pretty much in line?
<Q  Craig Ellis  Caris & Co., Inc.>:
Well, and again, if you go back to what we said in October, we looked at our own supply chain risks, both in terms of, I think, a lead frame that we bought from a supplier there that we knew would be disrupted, and some assembly/test that we had there. And I think we quantified that impact as about 1%. But again, that was just TIs supply chain. What we tried to communicate was the first-order effect, which would be the customer, the direct customer impact of hard disk drives that were manufactured in Thailand. And then maybe even a second-order effect of PC manufacturers that couldnt get hard disk drives, that might be weaker than otherwise expected. And again, we didnt, we had some estimates there, but clearly that is having impact. Certainly the first-order effect.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
I dont know how much to  were not the best source to be able to comment on the PC manufacturers. Clearly, theyre going to be impacted by the same macro considerations that every other market segment is, so they likely would have been weak anyway. Was that weakness exacerbated by a lack of storage? I dont know.
Did you have a follow-on, Chris  or, Craig  Im sorry.
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, no problem, Ron, thanks. With one of the design wins you have with OMAP 4, the Kindle Fire, youve done a good job getting other content in there, like Wi-Fi. As you look at your design-in funnel, with Ice Cream Sandwich systems, do you see a greater propensity of those design wins bundling more TI content, or how do we think about your ability to attach other components when you get that OMAP 4 design win?
<Q  Craig Ellis  Caris & Co., Inc.>:
I would describe that as pretty strong. No guarantees, but usually, almost always when we win OMAP, well add some power management, analog-type products attached to it and then sometimes, connectivity. We dont bundle the two, so there will be places we sell connectivity without OMAP, there will be places we sell OMAP without connectivity, and then there will be customers we sell both into. But, almost always, when we sell OMAP customers just find it more convenient to work with TI on a lot of the analog products such as power management as well as our sale forces is trained to work their way through those customer systems and pick up as much of that companion analog content as they possibly can. I would say when we sell OMAP we usually do very well selling other products outside of OMAP as well.
<A  Ron Slaymaker  Texas Instruments Incorporated>:
Okay, Craig, thank you for your questions.
Before we end the call let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you and good evening.
Operator: This does conclude todays conference. Thank you for your participation.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Jan. 23, 2012)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $3.42 billion, net income of $298 million and earnings per share of 25 cents.  EPS includes 16 cents in charges associated with the companys acquisition of National Semiconductor and 7 cents in charges associated with the closure of two older manufacturing facilities (details below).
Revenue in the fourth quarter was higher than expected across all our major product lines, reinforcing our belief that were at the bottom of this downturn.  Im pleased to say that despite the downturn and the lower factory utilization that came with it, cash flow from operations was strong and well above levels as compared with similar points in prior downturns.  Our strategic focus on our core businesses and efficient investment in capacity are key to our strong generation of cash, said Rich Templeton, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  As we move into 2012, we enter the final phase of our planned exit from the baseband market, and thus further tighten our focus on Analog, Embedded Processing and Wireless.
In addition to financial results, TI also announced plans to close two older semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas, over the course of the next 18 months.  Production from these sites will be moved to other more advanced TI facilities.  Combined, these factories supported about 4 percent of TIs revenue in 2011, and each employs about 500 people.  The total charge for these closures is estimated at about $215 million, of which $112 million was incurred in the fourth quarter and the remainder will occur over the next seven quarters.  Annual savings will be about $100 million once the transition is complete.  These sites have made strong, high-quality contributions over the 30-plus years each has operated, said Templeton.  They demonstrate the tremendous cash flow potential associated with analog products, where factory lives are literally measured in decades.  However, were now at the point where each of these sites requires significant upgrades, and it makes financial sense to shift production to larger, more advanced facilities.
4Q11 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
TI closed its acquisition of National Semiconductor on September 23, 2011, and from that date began to consolidate the results of the acquired operations into TIs Analog segment under the name Silicon Valley Analog.  Total acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter are $256 million.  As required by the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, these charges include $103 million in cost of revenue attributable primarily to the fair value write-up of acquired inventory.  The remainder, $153 million, includes amortization of intangibles, retention bonuses and restructuring costs.
Results also include $112 million of restructuring charges associated with the planned facility closings announced today.
In addition to the impact from acquisition-related charges, TIs fourth-quarter 2011 gross profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with low levels of factory utilization in the quarter, as well as charges for Wireless baseband inventory.
Operating profit declined from a year ago primarily due to acquisition-related charges, lower gross profit and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as a gain on the sale of a product line in the year-ago quarter.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was lower primarily due to higher total acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges, as well as lower gross profit.
TIs annual effective tax rate declined to 24 percent from the previously estimated 25 percent.  Results include a cumulative adjustment for this rate change, as well as a net discrete tax benefit of $11 million.
 
4Q11 segment results
 
*  Includes total acquisition-related charges of $256 million and restructuring charges of $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, total acquisition-related charges of $154 million in the third quarter of 2011 and a gain on the sale of a product line of $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
  
Analog:
(includes High Volume Analog & Logic, Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog)
  
Embedded Processing:
(includes digital signal processor and microcontroller catalog products that are sold across a wide variety of markets as well as application-specific products that are used in communications infrastructure and automotive electronics)
  
Wireless:
(includes
OMAP applications processors, connectivity products and baseband products)
Other:  
(includes
DLP
products, custom ASIC products, calculators and royalties as well as products sold under transitional supply agreements associated with recently acquired factories)
4Q11 additional financial information
Year 2011 financial summary
 
Results include total acquisition-related charges of $426 million in 2011 and a gain on the sale of a product line of $144 million in 2010.  Results also include restructuring charges of $112 million in 2011 compared with $33 million in 2010.
TIs operating profit declined in 2011 primarily due to lower gross profit and higher total acquisition-related charges, higher operating expenses that resulted primarily from the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog, and a gain on the sale of a product line in 2010.  Gross profit was negatively impacted primarily by a combination of lower revenue, lower average levels of factory utilization, acquisition-related charges and inventory charges.
Year 2011 segment results
 
 
2011 additional financial information
Outlook
For the first quarter of 2012, TI expects:
Baseband revenue is expected to decline from $279 million in the fourth quarter to about $75 million in the first quarter, and range from $50 million to $100 million in each remaining quarter of 2012.  EPS will be negatively impacted by about 9 cents from $170 million of total acquisition-related charges that will include about $150 million of acquisition charges and, additionally, about $20 million included in cost of revenue.  Restructuring charges will negatively impact EPS by about 1 cent.
TI will update its first-quarter outlook on March 8, 2012.
For the full year of 2012, TI expects approximately the following:
The tax rate estimate is based on current tax law and does not assume reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of 2011.
 
 
 
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), on which TI pays dividend equivalents, is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded from earnings per common share was $5 million, $14 million and $10 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and September 30, 2011, respectively; and $34 million and $44 million for years ended December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
* These balances have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect changes in estimates of fair value related to the acquisition of National Semiconductor.
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (April 23, 2012)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced first-quarter revenue of $3.12 billion, net income of $265 million and earnings per share of 22 cents.  EPS includes 10 cents of charges associated with the companys acquisition of National Semiconductor and restructuring.
 
As we expected, our business cycle bottomed in the first quarter, and early signs of growth began to emerge, said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and CEO.  Orders were up 13 percent, and backlog is growing again.  Particularly encouraging is the breadth of increased orders across geographical regions and markets, including the industrial sector.
 
Sales in our Analog segment were about level with the prior quarter.  We continue to make progress with Silicon Valley Analog, formerly National Semiconductor, as this product line gains traction with customers and holds a strong position in the important industrial market.  Sales in Embedded Processing were up 7 percent led by growth in the automotive and communications infrastructure markets.  Sales in our Wireless segment declined sharply as we entered the final phase of our exit from baseband products, which were less than 3 percent of total sales in the quarter.  We are expanding the reach of our Wireless segment into multiple markets and experiencing strong diversity in our design-ins.
Were poised for growth and share gains as markets rebound.  Our product portfolio is strong, and our design position with customers is excellent.  Our inventory is well-staged, and production in our factories is ramping.  Our teams are confident and hungry, and we expect 2012 to be a good year for growth.
1Q12 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
Total acquisition-related charges associated with TIs September 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor are $174 million in the first quarter.  These charges include $21 million in cost of revenue associated with the contract termination of a distributor.  The remainder, $153 million, includes amortization of intangibles, retention bonuses and other items.  Results also include $10 million of restructuring charges associated with the planned closings of two older factories announced in January 2012.
Revenue in the quarter includes insurance proceeds of about $65 million related to interruption of TIs business operations as a result of the 2011 Japan earthquake.
Compared with a year ago, lower gross profit in the quarter primarily reflects lower revenue.  Compared with the fourth quarter, lower gross profit reflects lower revenue, which was partially offset by lower charges to cost of revenue related to the National acquisition and an increase in insurance proceeds.
Operating profit declined from a year ago primarily due to lower gross profit, total acquisition-related charges and higher operating expenses due to the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit was higher primarily due to lower restructuring charges and lower total acquisition-related charges.
1Q12 segment results
*  Includes total acquisition-related charges of $174 million and restructuring charges of $10 million in the first quarter of 2012, total acquisition-related charges of $256 million and restructuring charges of $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and total acquisition-related charges of $2 million in the first quarter of 2011.

1Q12 additional financial information
Outlook
For the second quarter of 2012, TI expects:
The second quarters results will be negatively affected by about $100 million of acquisition charges and about $10 million of restructuring charges.  Combined, these items will impact EPS by about 6 cents.
TI will update its second-quarter outlook on June 11, 2012.
For the full year of 2012, TI continues to expect approximately the following:
The tax rate estimate is based on current tax law and does not assume reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of 2011.
 
 
 
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), on which we pay dividend equivalents, is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded is $4 million, $10 million and $5 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012, March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2011.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (July 23, 2012)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced second-quarter revenue of $3.34 billion, net income of $446 million and earnings per share of 38 cents.  EPS includes 6 cents of charges associated with the companys September 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and restructuring.
TI revenue in the second quarter was about as we had expected, said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and CEO.  Our Analog and Embedded Processing segments grew sequentially, while our Wireless segment declined.
Although we believe customers and distributors have low inventory levels, the global economic environment is causing both to become increasingly cautious in placing new orders.  Our backlog grew last quarter but orders slowed in the month of June and our backlog coverage for September is lower than normal.  As a result of this increased uncertainty, we currently estimate that our revenue in the third quarter will be about even with last quarter and below our seasonal average growth rate.  If customer demand increases as the quarter progresses, we are ready to support higher shipments with short product lead times, a strong inventory position and available manufacturing capacity.
 
In the meantime, we remain focused on strengthening our market positions in Analog and Embedded Processing.  These areas are complementary and benefit from TIs extensive and expanding relationships with customers around the world.  As we continue to broaden our portfolio of leadership products, especially our standard catalog products, we enhance our ability to serve these customers.
 
2Q12 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
Acquisition charges associated with TIs acquisition of National Semiconductor (now referred to as Silicon Valley Analog in TIs Analog segment) are $104 million in the second quarter and include amortization of intangibles, retention bonuses and other items.  Results also include $13 million of restructuring charges associated with the planned closings of two older factories announced in January 2012.
Compared with a year ago, lower gross profit in the quarter primarily reflects lower revenue and the associated costs from low levels of factory utilization.  Compared with the first quarter, higher gross profit reflects higher revenue, which more than offset lower insurance proceeds related to the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.
Operating profit declined from a year ago due about equally to higher acquisition and restructuring charges, lower gross profit and higher operating expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was due to the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit increased primarily due to higher gross profit.  Also contributing to this increase were lower acquisition charges as well as lower operating expenses.

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about August 6
2012, which is the fifth business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as "T+5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisors.

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in connection with any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person,
 
if any, who controls the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VI under the first or second paragraphs hereof is unavailable in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the
 
one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VI were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VI are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VI and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
In further consideration of the agreements of the Company herein contained, each Underwriter severally covenants as follows:
(a) Not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(b) Not to use, refer to or distribute any free writing prospectus except (i) a free writing prospectus that (A) is not an issuer free writing prospectus and (B) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Offered Securities or the offering thereof, which information is limited to the categories of terms referenced on Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement or otherwise permitted under Rule 134 of the Securities Act, (ii) a free writing prospectus as shall be agreed in writing with the Company that is not distributed, used or referred to by such Underwriter in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination (unless the Company consents in writing to such dissemination) or (iii) a free writing prospectus identified in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement as forming part of the Time of Sale Prospectus.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Manager's absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the Applicable Time and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange or in the U.S. over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or a severe deterioration in U.S. financial markets or any other calamity or crisis that is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clause (a)(iv), such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the Manager's judgment, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and this Agreement. Any such termination of this Agreement shall be without liability on the part of any Manager or on the part of the Company except as stated in Article IX.
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
 
agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, none of the Underwriters is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section VI hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Exhibit 99
 
      
DALLAS (Sept. 20, 2012) Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today said it will raise its quarterly cash dividend 24 percent.  The new quarterly dividend will be $0.21 per share of common stock, resulting in annual dividend payments of $0.84 per common share.  The current quarterly dividend is $0.17 per share.
This dividend increase is a direct result of our strengthening portfolio and our lower capital needs, said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive officer.  As more of our revenue comes from Analog and Embedded Processing, our cash flow from operations continues to improve.  In addition, our opportune purchases of manufacturing capacity have positioned us well for growth while also allowing our capital spending levels to drop.  This means that we can return more cash to our shareholders.
The new quarterly cash dividend will be payable November 19, 2012, to stockholders of record on October 31, 2012, contingent upon formal declaration by the Board of Directors at its regular meeting in October.
This is the ninth consecutive year TI has increased its dividend, and it marks the fiftieth year the company has paid dividends to its shareholders on an uninterrupted basis.

ITEM 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The Registrants news release dated October 22, 2012, regarding its third-quarter 2012 results of operations and financial condition is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
 
ITEM 9.01  Exhibits
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Oct. 22, 2012)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced third-quarter revenue of $3.39 billion, net income of $784 million and earnings per share of 67 cents.  EPS includes 7 cents of charges associated with the company's acquisition of National Semiconductor and restructuring that were comprehended in TI's outlook provided in September.  EPS also includes a benefit of 22 cents for changes in taxes and a Japanese pension program that were not included in the company's outlook.
"TI revenue grew sequentially and operations were well executed even though the economy and semiconductor market remained weak and likely will get weaker in the fourth quarter," said Rich Templeton, TI's chairman, president and CEO.  "Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing each grew revenue by 2 percent.  Our operations were disciplined, with expenses and inventory levels both down, and our core businesses grew profit faster than revenue."
Regarding TI's business model, which is focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, Templeton said, "These two core businesses now comprise 70 percent of our revenue.  The importance of this strategy shows in the strong cash that we generate even in weak markets and in our ability to return that cash to shareholders.  In the third quarter, our free cash flow exceeded $1 billion, and we returned more than 75 percent of it through dividends and share repurchases.  Our confidence in the long-term sustainability of our business model drove the dividend increase of 24 percent that we announced in the quarter."  
3Q12 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
Acquisition charges associated with TI's acquisition of National Semiconductor are $106 million in the third quarter and include amortization of intangibles, retention bonuses and other items.  Included in Restructuring charges/other is a net benefit of $144 million associated with the Japan pension program change.  Partially offsetting this benefit are expenses of $22 million associated with the previously announced planned closure or potential sale of several older factories.
Compared with a year ago, gross profit was about even as the effect of lower revenue and the costs associated with lower levels of factory utilization were offset by profit from higher business interruption insurance proceeds related to the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, as well as lower manufacturing costs.  Compared with the prior quarter, higher gross profit primarily reflects higher revenue, specifically business interruption insurance proceeds.  Business interruption insurance proceeds in the quarter were $60 million.
Operating profit increased from a year ago as the benefit from the Japan pension program change and lower acquisition charges more than offset higher operating expenses that resulted primarily from the inclusion of a full quarter of Silicon Valley Analog.  Compared with the second quarter, operating profit was higher primarily due to the Japan pension program change, as well as higher gross profit and lower operating expenses.
Results include a $90 million discrete tax benefit, which is primarily due to additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2007 through 2011, and a $67 million benefit from the cumulative effect of the company's lowering its estimated effective tax rate for 2012.  The lower tax rate estimate was primarily due to a revised estimate of the impact of non-U.S. effective tax rates.

TI will update its fourth-quarter outlook on December 10, 2012.
For the full year of 2012, TI expects approximately the following:

ITEM 2.05.  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On November 14, 2012, Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI") announced that it will reduce costs and focus investments in its Wireless business on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth.  Cost reductions include the elimination of about 1,700 jobs worldwide.  TI estimates that these actions will be substantially complete by the end of 2013.
Total charges for these actions are estimated to be about $325 million, of which about $220 million is for severance and related benefits and most of the remainder is for noncash impairments of intangible assets related to the Wireless business, including goodwill. Most of these charges will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The severance and related benefits will result in future cash expenditures.
As a result of these actions, TI expects annualized savings of about $450 million by the end of 2013.

Exhibit 99
 
 
DALLAS (Nov. 14, 2012)  Consistent with previously stated strategic plans, Texas Instruments (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) announced today it will reduce costs and focus investments in its Wireless business on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth. Cost reductions include the elimination of about 1,700 jobs worldwide.
TI previously outlined intentions to focus its OMAP processors and wireless connectivity solutions on a broader set of embedded applications with long life cycles, instead of its historical focus on the mobile market where large customers are increasingly developing their own custom chips. These changes require fewer resources and less investment.
"We have a great opportunity to reshape our OMAP processor and wireless connectivity product lines to concentrate on embedded markets. Momentum is already building with new embedded applications and a broad set of customers, and we are accelerating our efforts in these areas," said Greg Delagi, senior vice president of Embedded Processing. "These job reductions are something we do with a heavy heart because they impact people we care deeply about. We will work closely with all employees affected by these changes to provide a range of assistance related to compensation, benefits and job search."
As a result of these actions, the company expects annualized savings of about $450 million by the end of 2013. Total charges will be about $325 million, most of which will be accounted for in the current quarter. TI's fourth-quarter outlook, published on October 22, did not comprehend these restructuring charges.

The Registrants news release dated January 22, 2013, regarding its fourth-quarter and 2012 results of operations and financial condition is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Jan. 22, 2013)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $2.98 billion, net income of $264 million and earnings per share of 23 cents.
EPS includes 6 cents of charges associated with the companys 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation and restructuring that was included in the companys outlook provided in December.  EPS also includes 23 cents of charges associated with the recently announced restructuring of the companys Wireless business of which 21 cents was included in the companys outlook.  In addition, EPS includes 15 cents for a discrete tax benefit and associated interest that was not included in the companys outlook.  Excluding these items, non-GAAP EPS rounds to 36 cents.
We continue to operate in a weak demand environment, said Rich Templeton, TIs chairman, president and CEO.  Our visibility into future demand remains limited as our lead times are short and our customers are reluctant to commit to extended backlog.  On the positive side, we believe customers and distributors are operating with lean inventory.  Our own operations are disciplined and performing well, with gross margin up despite increased underutilization costs, and with operating expenses down from a year ago.
Even in the current economy, our strategy is yielding high free cash flow and strong returns to our shareholders.  For the full year, free cash flow of almost $3 billion grew 20 percent and was 23 percent of our revenue.  We returned 90 percent of this free cash flow to our shareholders through our continued share repurchases and higher dividend payments.  Our strong free cash flow is the result of more of our revenue coming from Analog and Embedded Processing, which offer solid growth and high margins and have low capital needs.  Our free cash flow will also benefit from our strategic purchases of manufacturing capacity during the past few years.  We have almost half of our manufacturing capacity available to support future growth, which means we can maintain our capital spending at very low levels in the years ahead, even as our revenue grows.
4Q12 financial summary
Amounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.
 
*  Non-GAAP; Cash flow from operations minus Capital expenditures.
Acquisition charges associated with TIs acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011 were $88 million in the fourth quarter, primarily amortization of intangibles.  Included in Restructuring charges/other are charges of $351 million associated with restructuring the Wireless business, including $90 million of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment, and $12 million associated with the previously announced planned closure of several older factories.
Compared with a year ago, gross profit declined due to lower revenue and the costs associated with lower levels of factory utilization.  These were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and the non-recurrence of the $103 million in cost of revenue in the year-ago quarter attributable primarily to the fair value write-up of acquired inventory associated with the National acquisition.  Compared with the prior quarter, gross profit declined due to lower revenue, including the non-recurrence of $60 million in business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the 2011 earthquake in Japan.
Operating profit decreased from a year ago as the combination of higher restructuring charges and lower gross profit more than offset lower acquisition charges and operating expenses.  Compared with the prior quarter, operating profit declined primarily due to higher Restructuring charges/other, including the Wireless restructuring charge and the non-recurrence of a $144 million benefit in the prior quarter associated with a change in a Japan pension program, as well as lower gross profit.
Other income (expense) included $38 million of income for interest associated with a discrete tax benefit. This tax benefit was $147 million and primarily consists of additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2006.
4Q12 segment results
 
*  Includes Restructuring charges/other and/or Acquisition charges.
 
 
  
Analog:
(includes High Volume Analog & Logic, Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog)

Beginning with the first-quarter 2013 financial report, TI will transition its segment reporting to align with the companys strategic focus and new organizational structure.  The Wireless segment will be eliminated, as the company has announced that it is winding down investment in Wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets.  Financial results for these products will be included in the Other segment for the remainder of their lives.  Financial results for Wireless products that address embedded applications, a strategic focus for the company, will be reported in the Embedded Processing segment.
4Q12 additional financial information
 
Year 2012 financial summary
 
*  Non-GAAP; Cash flow from operations minus Capital expenditures.
Results include total acquisition-related charges of $471 million in 2012, including $21 million in cost of revenue, and $426 million in 2011, including $111 million in cost of revenue.  Results also include Restructuring charges/other of $264 million in 2012 and $112 million in 2011.
TIs operating profit declined in 2012 primarily due to the combination of lower gross profit and higher operating expenses.  Gross profit declined as a result of lower revenue.  Operating expenses were higher as a result of the acquisition of National Semiconductor.
Year 2012 segment results
 
2012 additional financial information
The company used $1.80 billion to repurchase 59.8 million shares of its common stock and paid dividends of $819 million.
Outlook
For the first quarter of 2013, TI expects:
Revenue:  $2.69  2.91 billion
Earnings per share:  $0.24  0.32
At the middle of this range, revenue is expected to be down $179 million sequentially.  About $135 million, or about 75 percent, of this decline is expected to come from Wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets from which the company is exiting.
The first quarters EPS will be negatively affected by about 6 cents from acquisition and restructuring charges.  EPS will include a discrete tax benefit of 6 cents resulting from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2012.
TI will update its first-quarter outlook on March 7, 2013.
For the full year of 2013, TI expects approximately the following:
The tax rate estimate is based on current law and includes the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2013.
 
 
 
As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), on which we pay dividend equivalents, is excluded from the calculation of EPS.  The amount excluded is $4 million, $5 million and $14 million for the quarters ending December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and September 30, 2012, respectively; and $31 million and $34 million for years ending December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts in prior periods financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP financial information
This earnings release includes two measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (non-GAAP measures):  diluted earnings per share excluding the effects of certain costs, and free cash flow.  These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.
Free cash flow was calculated as noted in the body of the release by subtracting capital expenditures (Additions to property, plant and equipment) from the GAAP-based Cash flows from operating activities.  The components of this calculation are included in the tables in the body of the release.  We provide this non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to give investors insight into the companys liquidity, cash-generating capability and the amount of cash available to return to investors.
Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 include charges for the 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and various restructuring actions, as well as a discrete tax benefit.  A non-GAAP measure of EPS excluding these items provides investors insight into TIs underlying business results.  The table below reconciles this non-GAAP measure to results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99
DALLAS (Feb. 21, 2013)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today said it will increase its quarterly dividend by 33 percent, from $0.21 per share to $0.28, payable May 20, 2013, to shareholders of record on April 30, 2013.  Annualized, the new dividend will be $1.12.  Additionally, TI authorized the repurchase of an additional $5 billion of its common stock bringing the total outstanding authorization to $8.4 billion.

As a result, TI believes it can consistently convert 20-25 percent of its revenue into free cash flow* and return 100 percent of that free cash flow (less debt repayment) to shareholders.
With todays dividend announcement, this will be the 10 consecutive year of dividend increases.  The new dividend is contingent upon formal declaration by the Board of Directors at its regular meeting in April.  Common stock repurchases have reduced the companys outstanding shares by 36 percent since the end of 2004.

Non-GAAP financial information
This earnings release includes references to free cash flow and various ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (non-GAAP measures).  Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure of Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as Cash flow from operations). 
 
The free cash flow measures were compared to the following GAAP items to determine the various non-GAAP ratios presented below and referred to in the release:  Revenue, Dividends paid and Stock repurchases.  Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based ratios is provided in the table below.
 
The company believes all of these non-GAAP measures provide insight into its liquidity, its cash-generating capability and the amount of cash available to return to investors as well as insight into its financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.
 
The Cash flow from operations and Capital expenditures as a percentage of Revenue provided in the above chart will not calculate to the free cash flow as a percentage of Revenue due to rounding.
The Dividends paid and Stock repurchases as a percentage of Cash flow from operations provided in the above chart will not sum to the total cash returned as a percentage of Cash flow from operations due to rounding.

Exhibit 99.1
ITEM 1. Business.
Company Overview
At TI, we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We began operations in 1930. We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries. We have three segments: Analog, Embedded Processing and Other. We expect Analog and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and we therefore focus our resources on these segments.
We were the world's fourth largest semiconductor company in 2012 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from an external source.
Financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned Segment and geographic area data and is incorporated herein by reference.
Product Information
Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as chips) that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit. Our products, more than 100,000 orderable parts, are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment.
We sell catalog and, to a lesser extent, custom semiconductor products. Catalog products are designed for use by many customers and/or many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels. The majority of our catalog products are proprietary, but some are commodity products. The life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years, with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release. Custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application, are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer. The life cycles of custom products are generally determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months.
Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. Additional information regarding each segment's products follows.
Analog
Analog semiconductors change real-world signals - such as sound, temperature, pressure or images - by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as digital signal processors (DSPs). Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device, whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery. We estimate that we sell our Analog products to more than 100,000 customers. These sales generated about 55 percent of our revenue in 2012. According to external sources, the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about $39 billion in 2012. Our Analog segment's revenue in 2012 was about $7.0 billion, or about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position. We believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.
Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA).
HVAL products: These include both high-volume analog and logic products. High-volume analog includes integrated analog products for specific applications, including custom products. End markets for high-volume analog products include communications, automotive, computing and many consumer electronics products. Logic includes some commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications.
Power products: These include both catalog and application-specific products that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system. We design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices
1
(battery-powered devices, such as handheld consumer electronics, laptop computers and cordless power tools) and line-powered systems (products that require an external electrical source, such as computers, digital TVs, wireless basestations and high-voltage industrial equipment).
HPA products: These include catalog analog products, such as amplifiers, data converters and interface semiconductors, that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets, including the industrial, communications, computing and consumer electronics markets. HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.
SVA products: These consist of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) in 2011. These include power management, data converter, interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products, nearly all of which are complementary to our other Analog products. This portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets. SVA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.
Embedded Processing
Embedded Processing products are the brains of many electronic devices. Compared with general purpose microprocessors that perform many different tasks, embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. The devices vary from simple, low-cost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many end markets, particularly industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure.
An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.
Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 18 percent of our revenue in 2012. According to external sources, the worldwide market for embedded processors was about $17 billion in 2012. Our Embedded Processing segment's revenue in 2012 was about $2.3 billion. This was the number two position and represented about 13 percent of this fragmented market. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.
Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity.
Processor products: These include DSPs and applications processors. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors like our embedded OMAP
TM
and Sitara
TM
products run an industry-standard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks, often communicating with other systems.
Microcontroller products: Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system and low software complexity. Analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers. Microcontroller products also include radio frequency identification (RFID) products, which are frequently used in automotive applications and sold along with our microcontroller products.
Connectivity products: Connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data, and the requirements for speed, data capability, distance and power vary depending on the application. Our Connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements, including low-power wireless network standards like Zigbee
and other technologies like Bluetooth
, WiFi, GPS and Near Field Communications. Our Connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products, enabling data to be collected, transmitted and acted upon.
Other
Other includes revenue from our smaller product lines, such as DLP
(primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and calculators. It includes
2
royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures. We also include revenue, about $1.2 billion in 2012, from our baseband products and from our OMAP applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphone and consumer tablet applications, all of which are product lines that we have previously announced we are exiting. We expect this revenue to substantially cease by the end of 2013. Other generated about $3.6 billion in 2012.
We also include in Other restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related charges that are not used in evaluating results of and allocating resources to our Analog and Embedded Processing segments. These acquisition-related charges include certain fair-value adjustments, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, acquisition-related retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets. Other also includes certain corporate-level items, such as litigation and environmental costs, insurance proceeds, and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations, such as our worldwide manufacturing, facilities and procurement operations.

Applications for Our Products
The table below lists the major end markets that used our products in 2012 and the approximate percentage of our 2012 product revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets.
Market Characteristics
Product cycle
The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes. Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature.
Market cycle
The semiconductor cycle is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient
4
manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. The semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
Seasonality
Our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation. Our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second and third quarters, as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons. Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters.
Competitive landscape
We face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and depth of the sales network, technological innovation, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and scale.
The primary competitive factors for our Analog products include design proficiency, a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance, applications and sales support, and manufacturing expertise and capacity. Our primary Analog competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.; Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; Intersil Corporation; Linear Technology Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; QUALCOMM Incorporated; Richtek Technology Corporation; and STMicroelectronics NV.
The primary competitive factors for our Embedded Processing products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, installed base of software, software expertise, applications and sales support, and a product's performance and power characteristics. Primary competitors of our Embedded Processing segment include Atmel Corporation; Broadcom Corp.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; Microchip Technology, Inc.; NVIDIA Corporation; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; QUALCOMM Incorporated; Renesas Electronics Corporation; and STMicroelectronics NV.
Manufacturing
Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is tested, the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks, with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks.
The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology. Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable, and therefore less expensive, equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced CMOS logic products, such as our OMAP products.
We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity, potentially hurting our profit margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.
We expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs. To supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2012, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers and about 75 percent of our advanced CMOS logic needs from external foundries.
In 2011, we initiated closure of an older wafer fabrication facility in Hiji, Japan, and another in Houston, Texas. We expect to complete these plant closures in 2013.
5
Inventory
Our inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand. Because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence, we generally carry more inventory of those products than custom products. Additionally, we sometimes maintain catalog-product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished-goods inventory of low-volume products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand. We also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors.
Design Centers
Our design centers provide design, engineering and product application support as well as after-sales customer service. The design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers.
Customers
Our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), contract manufacturers and distributors. (An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others. An ODM designs and manufactures products for other companies, which then sell those products under their own brand.) In 2012, no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue.
Sales and Distribution
We market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force, distributors and authorized third-party sales representatives. We have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of China, India and Eastern Europe over the last few years. Distributors located around the world account for about 50 percent of our revenue. Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers. They also sell products from our competitors. Our distribution network holds a mix of distributor-owned and TI-consigned inventory. Over time, we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment. We sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers.
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments
From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio. We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies. Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to us. In September 2011, we acquired National Semiconductor Corporation.
Backlog
We define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers' individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations. Accordingly, our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period. Our backlog of orders was $1.17 billion at December 31, 2012, and $1.39 billion at December 31, 2011.
Raw Materials
We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also
6
have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future. In general, our license agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation.
Our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business.
We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies.
We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are Texas Instruments and our corporate monogram. Other valuable trademarks include OMAP
TM
and DLP
.
Research and Development
Our R&D expense was $1.88 billion in 2012, compared with $1.72 billion in 2011 and $1.57 billion in 2010. Our primary areas of R&D investment are Analog and Embedded Processing products.
We conduct most of our R&D internally. However, we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties, including software suppliers, universities and select external industry consortia, and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology.
From time to time we may terminate R&D projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product. We do not expect that all of our R&D projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale, or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion.

Notes to financial statements
1. Description of business and significant accounting policies and practices
Business
At Texas Instruments (TI), we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have
two
reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows:
We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. As previously announced, we restructured our Wireless business to focus our OMAP applications processors and connectivity products (formerly Wireless products) on embedded applications with long life cycles. Consistent with this restructuring, effective January 1, 2013, the Wireless segment was eliminated. Financial results for embedded OMAP applications processors and embedded connectivity products, both of which have many of the same characteristics as the products in our Embedded Processing segment, are now reported in that segment. Financial results for baseband products and Wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets, both of which are product lines that we have announced we are exiting, are included in Other. We also reclassified certain product lines, primarily radio frequency identification (RFID) products, from Other to Embedded Processing. See Note 16 for additional information on our business segments.
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods financial statements to conform to the
2012
presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.
On September 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of National. We accounted for this transaction under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 - Business Combinations, and the consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of National from the date of acquisition. See Note 2 for more detailed information.

We recognize revenue from direct sales of our products to our customers, including shipping fees, when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized consistent with the principles discussed above, but delivery occurs when the customer pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Estimates of product returns for quality reasons and of price allowances (based on historical experience, product shipment analysis and customer contractual arrangements) are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances include volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected.
We recognize revenue from direct sales of our products to our distributors, net of allowances, consistent with the principles discussed above. Title transfers to the distributors at delivery or when the products are pulled from consignment inventory, and payment is due on our standard commercial terms; payment terms are not contingent upon resale of the products.
We calculate credit allowances based on historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. For instance, we sell to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities they may have. To estimate allowances, we use statistical percentages of revenue, determined quarterly, based upon recent historical adjustment trends. We also provide allowances for certain growth-based incentives.
We provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slow-selling or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributors purchases from us. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributors on-hand inventory, we may credit them for the difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price
7
difference applied to our estimate of each distributors on-hand inventory of that product. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner.
We determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees. We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable. Where royalties are based on a percentage of licensee sales of royalty-bearing products, we recognize royalty revenue by applying this percentage to our estimate of applicable licensee sales. We base this estimate on historical experience and an analysis of each licensees sales results. Where royalties are based on fixed payment amounts, we recognize royalty revenue ratably over the term of the royalty agreement. Where warranted, revenue from licensees may be recognized on a cash basis.
We include shipping and handling costs in COR.
Advertising costs
We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was
$46 million
in
2012
,
$43 million
in
2011
and
$44 million
in
2010
.
Income taxes
We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Other assessed taxes
Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our statements of income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Unvested awards of share-based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our restricted stock units (RSUs), are considered to be participating securities and the two-class method is used for purposes of calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and, therefore, is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. 
Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions):
 
8
Potentially dilutive securities representing
52 million
,
24 million
and
66 million
shares of common stock that were outstanding during
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Investments
We present investments on our balance sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments. Specific details are as follows:
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. Consigned inventory was
$169 million
and
$129 million
as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively.
We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A specific allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. Remaining inventory includes a salability and obsolescence allowance based on an analysis of historical disposal activity. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs.
Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles and other capitalized costs
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization.
Impairments of long-lived assets
We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1 for our reporting units. The test compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value including goodwill. See Note 10 for additional information.
Foreign currency
The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are remeasured at historic exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E.
9
Derivatives and hedging
In connection with the issuance of variable-rate long-term debt in May 2011, as more fully described in Note 12, we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows related to interest payments. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are credited or charged to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (AOCI).
We also use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments.
We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Changes in accounting standards
As of December 31, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board had issued several accounting standards that we have not yet been required to adopt. None of these standards would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or financial disclosures.
2. Acquisition-related charges
National acquisition
On September 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of National by acquiring all issued and outstanding common shares in exchange for total consideration of
$6.56 billion
. We recognized
$3.528 billion
of goodwill, which was applied to the Analog segment.
None
of the goodwill related to the National acquisition was deductible for tax purposes.
We incurred various costs as a result of the acquisition of National that are included in Other consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. These total acquisition-related charges are as follows:
In 2011, we discontinued using one of Nationals distributors. We acquired the distributors inventory at fair value, resulting in an incremental charge of
$21 million
to COR upon sale of the inventory in 2012.
At acquisition, we recognized costs associated with the adjustments to write up the value of acquired inventory and property, plant and equipment to fair value. These costs are in addition to the normal expensing of the acquired assets based on their carrying or book value prior to the acquisition. The total fair-value write-up of
$96 million
for the acquired inventory was expensed as that inventory was sold. The total fair-value write-up for the acquired property, plant and equipment was
$436 million
. In the fourth quarter of 2011, depreciation was
$15 million
. It continues at a declining rate and is no longer separately disclosed as an acquisition-related charge.
10
The amount of recognized amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the National acquisition is based on estimated useful lives varying between
two
and
ten
years. See Note 10 for additional information.
Retention bonuses reflect amounts already or expected to be paid to former National employees who fulfill agreed-upon service period obligations and are recognized ratably over the required service period.
Stock-based compensation was recognized for the accelerated vesting of equity awards upon the termination of employees, with additional compensation being recognized over the applicable vesting period for the remaining grantees.
Severance and other benefits costs were for former National employees who were terminated after the closing date. These costs totaled
$70 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011, with
$41 million
in charges related to change of control provisions under existing employment agreements and
$29 million
in charges for announced employment reductions affecting about
350
jobs. All of these jobs were eliminated by the end of 2012 as a result of redundancies and cost efficiency measures, with approximately
$16 million
of additional expense recognized in 2012. Of the
$86 million
in cumulative charges recognized through December 31, 2012,
$65 million
was paid in 2012 and
$14 million
was paid in 2011.
Transaction and other costs include various expenses incurred in connection with the National acquisition. In 2011, we also incurred bridge financing costs.
In conformance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805  Business Combinations, the following unaudited summaries of pro forma combined results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, give effect to the acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2010. These pro forma summaries do not reflect any operating efficiencies, cost savings or revenue enhancements that may be achieved by the combined companies. In addition, certain non-recurring expenses, such as restructuring charges and retention bonuses, are not reflected in the pro forma summaries. These pro forma summaries are presented for informational purposes only and are not indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been had the acquisition taken place as of that date, nor are they indicative of future consolidated results of operations.
Other acquisitions
In October 2010, we acquired our first semiconductor manufacturing site in China, located in the Chengdu High-tech Zone. This acquisition, which was recorded as a business combination, used net cash of
$140 million
. As contractually agreed, we made an additional payment of
$35 million
to the seller in October 2011.
In August 2010, we completed the acquisition of
two
wafer fabs and equipment in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, for net cash of
$130 million
. The acquisition of the fabs and related
200
-millimeter equipment was recorded as a business combination for net cash of
$59 million
. We also settled a contractual arrangement with a third party for our benefit for net cash of
$12 million
, which was recorded as a charge in COR in Other. Additionally, we incurred acquisition-related costs of
$1 million
, which were recorded in SG&A. This acquisition also included
300
-millimeter production tools, which we recorded as a capital purchase for net cash of
$58 million
.
  
The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Operating results for transitional supply agreements are included in Other. Pro forma financial information for these acquisitions would not be materially different from amounts reported.
11
3. Restructuring charges/other
Restructuring charges/other is comprised of the following components:
Restructuring charges/other recognized by segment are as follows:
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges may consist of voluntary or involuntary severance-related charges, asset-related charges and other costs to exit activities. We recognize voluntary termination benefits when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement. We recognize involuntary severance-related charges depending on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. If the former, we recognize the charges once they are probable and the amounts are estimable. If the latter, we recognize the charges once the benefits have been communicated to employees.
Restructuring activities associated with assets are recorded as an adjustment to the basis of the asset, not as a liability. When we commit to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we accelerate the recognition of depreciation to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. When an asset is held to be sold, we write down the carrying value to its net realizable value and cease depreciation. Restructuring actions may be viewed as an impairment indicator requiring testing of the recoverability of intangible assets, including goodwill.
2012 Wireless action
In November 2012, we announced an action concerning our Wireless business that, when complete, is expected to reduce annualized expenses by about
$450 million
and will focus our investments on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth. About
1,700
jobs worldwide are expected to be eliminated. The total restructuring charges related to this action will be about
$360 million
, of which about
$245 million
will be for severance and related benefits. We recognized
$351 million
of these costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 in Other consisting of:
$245 million
for severance and benefit costs and other non-cash items of
$3 million
of accelerated depreciation of the affected facilities' assets,
$13 million
for other exit costs and
$90 million
for the non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill. See Note 10 for additional information on the goodwill impairment charge. We estimate that this action will be substantially complete by the end of 2013. As of December 31, 2012,
$4 million
has been paid to terminated employees for severance and benefits related to this action.
2011 action
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized restructuring charges associated with the announced plans to close
two
older semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas, in 2013. Each facility employed about
500
12
people. The total charge for these closures is estimated at
$215 million
, of which
$161 million
has been recognized through December 31, 2012, consisting of:
$113 million
for severance and benefit costs,
$23 million
of accelerated depreciation of the facilities assets and
$25 million
for other exit costs. Of the estimated
$215 million
total cost, about
$135 million
will be for severance and related benefits, about
$30 million
will be for accelerated depreciation of facility assets and about
$50 million
will be for other exit costs. In 2012,
$11 million
was paid to terminated employees for severance and benefits related to this action.
The restructuring action related to the acquisition of National is discussed in Note 2 and is reflected in Acquisition charges in our Consolidated statements of income.
2008/2009 actions
In October 2008, we announced actions to reduce expenses in our Wireless business, especially our baseband operation. In January 2009, we announced actions that included broad-based employment reductions to align our spending with weakened demand. Combined, these actions eliminated about
3,900
jobs; they were completed in 2009.
The table below reflects the changes in accrued restructuring balances associated with these actions:
(a) Reflects charges for goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation, impacts of postretirement benefit plans and accelerated depreciation.
The accrual balances above are a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment.
Other
Gain on transfer of Japan substitutional pension
During the third quarter of 2012, we transferred the obligations and assets of the substitutional portion of our Japan pension program from the pension trust to the government of Japan, resulting in a net gain of
$144 million
. See Note 11 for additional details.
Gain on divested product line
In November 2010, we divested a product line previously included in Other for
$148 million
and recognized a gain in operating profit of
$144 million
.
13
4. Losses associated with the 2011 earthquake in Japan
On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck near
two
of our
three
semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Japan. Our manufacturing site in Miho suffered substantial damage during the earthquake, our facility in Aizu experienced significantly less damage and our site in Hiji was undamaged. We maintain earthquake insurance policies in Japan for limited coverage for property damage and business interruption losses.
In 2011, we incurred cumulative gross operating losses of
$101 million
related to the earthquake and associated events in Japan. These losses related to property damage, the underutilization expense we incurred from having our manufacturing assets only partially loaded and costs associated with recovery teams assembled from across the world. Gross operating losses do not comprehend any lost revenue.
These losses have been offset by
$36 million
in cumulative insurance proceeds related to property damage claims (
$23 million
received in 2011 and
$13 million
for 2012). Almost all of these costs and proceeds are included in COR in our Consolidated statements of income and are recorded in Other.
In addition, we recognized
$172 million
in cumulative insurance proceeds through December 31, 2012, (
$135 million
received in 2012 and
$37 million
received in 2011) related to business interruption claims. These proceeds are recorded as revenue in our Consolidated statements of income and in Other.
In the third quarter of 2012, we completed discussions with our insurers and their advisors, settling all associated claims against our policies. All claims related to these events have been settled and the proceeds received.
5. Stock-based compensation
We have stock options outstanding to participants under various long-term incentive plans. We also have assumed stock options that were granted by companies that we later acquired. Unless the options are acquisition-related replacement options, the option price per share may not be less than
100 percent
of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Substantially all the options have a
ten
-year term and vest ratably over
four
years. Our options generally continue to vest after the option recipient retires.
We also have RSUs outstanding under the long-term incentive plans.
Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on the vesting date
, which is generally
four
years after the date of grant. Upon vesting, the shares are issued without payment by the grantee. RSUs generally do not continue to vest after the recipients retirement date. Holders of most RSUs receive an annual cash payment equal to the dividends paid on our common stock.
We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under various director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred compensation accounts established for such directors.
We also have an employee stock purchase plan under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employees compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is
85 percent
of the fair market value on the exercise date, and options have a
three
-month term.
Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:
These amounts include expense related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our employee stock purchase plan and are net of expected forfeitures.
14
We issue awards of non-qualified stock options generally with graded vesting provisions (e.g.,
25 percent
per year for
four
years). We recognize the related compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award. For awards to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the longer of the service period required to be performed by the employee in order to earn the award, or a
six
-month period.
Our RSUs generally vest
four
years after the date of grant. We recognize the related compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair-value methods and assumptions
We account for all awards granted under our various stock-based compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options under long-term incentive and director compensation plans using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions.
We determine expected volatility on all options granted after July 1, 2005, using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates.
We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling
ten
-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available.
Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for
zero
-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options.
Expected dividend yields are based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term.
The fair value per share of RSUs that we grant is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Our employee stock purchase plan is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount.
15
Long-term incentive and director compensation plans
Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans during
2012
were as follows:
The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years
2012
,
2011
and
2010
was
$31.60
,
$33.20
and
$23.47
per share, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, the total fair value of shares vested from RSU grants was
$120 million
,
$155 million
and
$51 million
, respectively.
Summarized information about stock options outstanding at
December 31, 2012
, is as follows:
During the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, the aggregate intrinsic value (i.e., the difference in the closing market price and the exercise price paid by the optionee) of options exercised was
$244 million
,
$231 million
and
$140 million
, respectively.
Summarized information as of
December 31, 2012
, about outstanding stock options that are vested and expected to vest, as well as stock options that are currently exercisable, is as follows:
(a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures of approximately
4 million
shares. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was
$414 million
.
As of
December 31, 2012
, the total future compensation cost related to equity awards not yet recognized in the Consolidated statements of income was
$460 million
, consisting of
$143 million
related to unvested stock options and
$317 million
related to RSUs. The
$460 million
will be recognized as follows:
$205 million
in 2013,
$153 million
in 2014,
$94 million
in 2015 and
$8 million
in 2016.
Employee stock purchase plan
Options outstanding under the employee stock purchase plan at
December 31, 2012
, had an exercise price of
$27.47
per share (
85 percent
of the fair market value of TI common stock on the date of automatic exercise). Of the total outstanding options,
none
were exercisable at year-end
2012
.
16
Employee stock purchase plan transactions during
2012
were as follows:
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the employee stock purchase plans during the years
2012
,
2011
and
2010
was
$4.52
,
$4.59
and
$3.97
per share, respectively. During the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, the total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was
$13 million
,
$10 million
and
$9 million
, respectively.
Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares
Our practice is to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options generally from treasury shares and, on a limited basis, from previously unissued shares. We settled stock option plan exercises using treasury shares of
25,064,951
in
2012
;
27,308,311
in
2011
and
19,077,274
in
2010
; and previously unissued common shares of
180,955
in
2012
;
390,438
in
2011
and
342,380
in
2010
.
Upon vesting of RSUs, we issued treasury shares of
3,187,490
in
2012
;
3,748,623
in
2011
and
1,392,790
in
2010
, and previously unissued common shares of
4,593
in
2012
;
73,852
in
2011
, with
none
in
2010
.
Shares available for future grant and reserved for issuance are summarized below:
(a) Includes
129,033
shares credited to directors deferred compensation accounts that settle in shares of TI common stock. These shares are not included as grants outstanding at
December 31, 2012
.
Effect on cash flows
Cash received from the exercise of options was
$523 million
in
2012
,
$690 million
in
2011
and
$407 million
in
2010
. The related net tax impact realized was
$56 million
,
$45 million
and
$21 million
(which includes excess tax benefits realized of
$38 million
,
$31 million
and
$13 million
) in
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.
 
6. Profit sharing plans
Profit sharing benefits are generally formulaic and determined by one or more subsidiary or company-wide financial metrics. We pay profit sharing benefits primarily under the company-wide TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan. This plan provides for profit sharing to be paid based solely on TIs operating margin for the full calendar year. Under this plan, TI must achieve a minimum threshold of
10 percent
operating margin before any profit sharing is paid. At
10 percent
operating margin, profit sharing will be
2 percent
of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is
20 percent
of eligible payroll, which is paid only if TIs operating margin is at or above
35 percent
for a full calendar year.
We recognized
$96 million
,
$143 million
and
$279 million
of profit sharing expense under the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan in
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.

7. Income taxes
Income before income taxes
 
Provision (benefit) for income taxes
Principal reconciling items from income tax computed at the statutory federal rate follow:
The total provision for 2012 in the reconciliation above includes
$252 million
of discrete tax benefits primarily for additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2011.
18
The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on the Consolidated balance sheets as follows:
We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. In
2012
, we recognized a net increase of
$43 million
in our valuation allowance. This increase was due to valuation allowances on unutilized tax credits. While the net deferred tax assets of
$2.16 billion
at
December 31, 2012
, are not assured of realization, our assessment is that a valuation allowance is not required on this balance. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income.
We have U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately
$175 million
,
none
of which will expire before the year 2023.
A provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend
payments from these subsidiaries are expected to result in additional tax liability. The remaining undistributed earnings (approximately
$5.54 billion
at
December 31, 2012
) have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings. The indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are primarily invested in tangible assets such as inventory and property, plant and equipment. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were
$171 million
,
$902 million
and
$1.47 billion
for the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.

Uncertain tax positions
We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements, we must determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E.
The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are summarized as follows:
The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of Deferred credits and other liabilities on our
December 31, 2012
, balance sheet. The interest receivable is a component of Other assets on our
December 31, 2012
, balance sheet.
Within the
$184 million
liability for uncertain tax positions as of
December 31, 2012
, are positions totaling
$159 million
that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized,
$78 million
of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized, primarily related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation. Regarding the
$184 million
liability:
Within the
$210 million
liability for uncertain tax positions as of
December 31, 2011
, are uncertain tax positions totaling
$233 million
that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized,
$83 million
of deferred tax assets would also be realized, primarily related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation.
As of
December 31, 2012
, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2000 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2008 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation. These procedures pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2003 through 2008. U.S. federal tax returns for National are currently under audit for tax years through fiscal year 2012.
20
In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the U.S., our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2005.
8. Financial instruments and risk concentration
Financial instruments
We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, the fair value of which was not material as of
December 31, 2012
. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of
December 31, 2012
, had a notional value of
$305 million
to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including
$140 million
to sell Japanese yen,
$26 million
to sell Chinese yuan and
$26 million
to sell British pound sterling.
Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our postretirement plan assets and deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value, which is described in Note 9. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 9 for the definition of Level 2 inputs.
Risk concentration
Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated balance sheets.
Details of these Accounts receivable allowances are as follows:
9. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities
Debt and equity investments
We classify our investments as available for sale, trading, equity method or cost method. Most of our investments are classified as available for sale.
Available-for-sale and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices, broker quotes or, when necessary, financial models (see fair-value discussion below). Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated balance sheets. We record other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities in OI&E in our Consolidated statements of income.
We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Changes in the fair value of debt securities classified as trading securities are recorded in OI&E.
Our other investments are not measured at fair value but are accounted for using either the equity method or cost method. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are reflected in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investees financial results. Gains and losses on cost-method investments are recorded in OI&E when realized or when an impairment of the investments value is warranted based on our assessment of the recoverability of each investment.
21
Details of our investments and related unrealized gains and losses included in AOCI are as follows:
At
December 31, 2012
, we had no significant unrealized losses associated with our available-for-sale investments. We have determined that our remaining available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses are not other-than-temporarily impaired as we expect to recover the entire cost basis of these securities. We do not intend to sell these investments, nor do we expect to be required to sell these investments, before a recovery of the cost basis. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
. During the third quarter of 2012, we sold all of our remaining investments in auction-rate securities.
For the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were
$2.20 billion
,
$3.55 billion
and
$2.56 billion
, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not significant.
 
The following table presents the aggregate maturities of investments in debt securities classified as available for sale at
December 31, 2012
:
Gross realized gains and losses from sales of long-term investments were not significant for
2012
,
2011
or
2010
. Other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of these investments recognized in OI&E were
$7 million
,
$2 million
and
$1 million
in
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.
22
Fair-value considerations
We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements.
The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.
 
23
The following table summarizes the change in the fair values for Level 3 assets and liabilities for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.
10. Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles
The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by segment for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2012, and determined the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value was based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements.
In November 2012, as a result of unsuccessful efforts to divest certain Wireless product lines and the subsequent decision to restructure and wind down those product lines, we reassessed the recoverability of the goodwill associated with the former Wireless segment. We determined its fair value, using a discounted cash flow analysis, was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, performed the required second step of the impairment analysis to determine the amount of the impairment charge. We deducted the fair value of the former Wireless segment from the total of the estimated fair values of the segment's identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets with no carrying value. This calculation resulted in an implied negative fair value of goodwill. As a result, we recognized a non-cash, non-tax deductible impairment charge of
$90 million
for all the associated goodwill of the former Wireless segment. We recognized this impairment in Restructuring charges/other in the Consolidated statements of income, as discussed in Note 3. There was
no
impairment of goodwill during
2011
or
2010
.
24
The addition to Analog goodwill in
2011
was from the National acquisition. We also recognized other intangible assets associated with this acquisition of
$2.96 billion
, primarily for developed technology and customer relationships. In
2012
, we had
no
additional intangible assets from an acquisition. The components of acquisition-related intangible assets as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, are as follows:
(a) In-process R&D is not amortized until the associated project has been completed. Alternatively, if the associated project is determined not to be viable, it will be expensed.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was
$342 million
,
$111 million
and
$48 million
for
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively, primarily related to developed technology. Amortization expenses related to the National acquisition were
$325 million
and
$87 million
for
2012
and
2011
, respectively. Future estimated amortization of acquisition-related intangibles for the years ended December 31 is as follows:
11. Postretirement benefit plans
Plan descriptions
We have various employee retirement plans including defined benefit, defined contribution and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. As a part of the National acquisition, we assumed the assets and liabilities of its defined benefit plans, primarily those associated with the United Kingdom and Germany.
U.S. retirement plans:
Our principal retirement plans in the U.S. are qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans (all of which were closed to new participants after November 1997), a defined contribution plan and an enhanced defined contribution plan. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.
Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pre-tax contributions to various investment choices, including a TI common stock fund. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans, and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings.
At
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, as a result of employees elections, TIs U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling
20 million
shares and
22 million
shares valued at
$610 million
and
$639 million
, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares for
2012
and
2011
were
$16 million
and
$13 million
, respectively.
25
Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was
$70 million
in
2012
,
$55 million
in
2011
and
$50 million
in
2010
.
Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of service and the highest
five
consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.
 
U.S. retiree health care benefit plan:
U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employees date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plans participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement.
Non-U.S. retirement plans:
We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employees years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.
As of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, as a result of employees elections, TIs non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at
$13 million
and
$12 million
, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock for
2012
and
2011
were not material.
 
Effect on the statements of income and balance sheets
Expense related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans was as follows:
(a) Includes restructuring and non-restructuring-related settlement charges.
(b) In Japan, we maintain employee pension fund plans (EPFs) pursuant to the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law(JWPIL). An EPF consists of two portions: a substitutional portion based on JWPIL-determined minimum old-age pension benefits similar to Social Security benefits in the United States; and a corporate portion established at the discretion of each employer. Employers and employees are exempt from contributing to the Japanese Pension Insurance (JPI) if the substitutional portion is funded by an EPF.
The JWPIL was amended to permit each EPF to separate the substitutional portion and transfer those obligations and related assets to the government of Japan. After such a transfer, the employer is required to contribute periodically to JPI, and the government of Japan is responsible for future benefit payments relating to the substitutional portion.
During the third quarter of
2012
, our EPF received final approval for such a separation and transferred the obligations and assets of its substitutional portion to the government of Japan. On a pre-tax basis, this resulted in a net gain of
26
$144 million
recorded in Restructuring charges/other on our Consolidated statements of income and included in Other. This net gain of
$144 million
consisted of two parts - a gain of
$337 million
, representing the difference between the fair values of the obligations settled (
$533 million
) and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan (
$196 million
), offset by a settlement loss of
$193 million
related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in AOCI.
For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on the plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of
three
years.
 
Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans were as follows:
27
Amounts recognized on the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2012
, were as follows:
Amounts recognized on the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2011
, were as follows:
Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about
$100 million
to our retirement benefit plans in
2013
. The amounts shown for underfunded U.S. defined benefit plans were for non-qualified pension plans. Because contributions to those non-qualified plans are not tax deductible until the benefit is actually paid to the employee, we do not fund them. As of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, the unfunded benefit obligations of those non-qualified plans were
$61 million
and
$56 million
, respectively.
Accumulated benefit obligations, which represent the benefit obligations excluding the impact of future salary increases, were
$1.01 billion
and
$875 million
at year-end
2012
and
2011
, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and
$2.23 billion
and
$2.54 billion
at year-end
2012
and
2011
, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.
The amounts recorded in AOCI for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, are detailed below by plan type:
The estimated amounts of net actuarial loss and unrecognized prior service cost (credit) included in AOCI as of
December 31, 2012
, that are expected to be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are:
$23 million
and
$1 million
for the U.S. defined benefit plans;
$11 million
and
$4 million
for the U.S. retiree health care plan; and
$39 million
and
($4) million
for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.
28
Information on plan assets
We report and measure the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at fair value. The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 9.
29
The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. In recent years, our investment policy has shifted toward a closer matching of the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have added a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. For the U.S. plans, we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on investments in U.S. equity funds.
The only Level 3 assets in our worldwide benefit plans are certain private equity limited partnerships in our U.S. pension plan and diversified hedge and property funds in a non-U.S. pension plan. These investments are valued using inputs from the fund managers and internal models. The following table summarizes the change in the fair values for Level 3 plan assets for the years ending
December 31, 2012
and
2011
:
 
30
Assumptions and investment policies
We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the U.S., we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plans expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. Both the settlement approach and the yield curve approach produce a discount rate that recognizes each plans distinct liability characteristics. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate.
Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries.
The table below shows target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets.
We intend to rebalance the plans investments when they are not within the target allocation ranges. Additional contributions are invested consistent with the target ranges and may be used to rebalance the portfolio. The investment allocations and individual investments are chosen with regard to the duration of the obligations of each plan.
31
Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31, are as follows:
The plans are slightly outside their target allocation ranges due to cash funding late in the year.
None
of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. As of
December 31, 2012
, we do not expect to return any of the plans assets to TI in the next 12 months.
The following table shows the benefits we expect to pay to participants from the plans in the next ten years. Almost all of the payments will be made from plan assets and not from company assets.
Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care plan at December 31 are as follows:
A
one
percentage point increase or decrease in health care cost trend rates over all future periods would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the U.S. retiree health care plan at
December 31, 2012
, by
$26 million
or
$22 million
, respectively. The service cost and interest cost components of
2012
plan expense would have increased or decreased by
$2 million
.
 
Deferred compensation arrangements
We have a deferred compensation plan that allows U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under this plan are made based on the participants distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans.
As of
December 31, 2012
, our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plan was
$139 million
and is recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. Except as described in the next paragraph,
no
assets are held in trust for the deferred compensation plan and so we remain liable to the participants. To serve as an economic hedge against changes in fair values of this liability, we invest in similar mutual funds that are recorded in Long-term investments. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related investment in SG&A as discussed in Note 9.
In connection with the National acquisition, we assumed its deferred compensation plan. As of
December 31, 2012
, this consisted of
$35 million
of obligations and matching assets held in a Rabbi trust.
No
further contributions will be made to this plan.
32
12. Debt and lines of credit
Short-term borrowings
We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of
December 31, 2012
, we have a
five
-year variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to
$2 billion
through March 2017. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of
December 31, 2012
, we have
no
commercial paper outstanding, having repaid
$1 billion
on a cumulative basis in
2012
.
Long-term debt
In August 2012, we issued an aggregate principal amount of
$1.5 billion
of fixed-rate long-term debt, with
$750 million
due in 2015 and
$750 million
due in 2019. The proceeds of the offering were
$1.492 billion
, net of the original issuance discount. We also incurred
$7 million
of issuance costs that are included in Other assets and are being amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt.
In May 2011, we issued fixed- and floating-rate long-term debt to help fund the National acquisition. The proceeds of the offering were
$3.497 billion
, net of the original issuance discount. We also incurred
$12 million
of issuance costs that are included in Other assets and are being amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt.
We also have an interest rate swap agreement related to the
$1 billion
floating-rate debt due
2013
. Under this agreement, we will receive variable payments based on
three
-month LIBOR rates and pay a fixed rate through
May 15, 2013
. Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to exactly offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the
three
-month LIBOR-based interest payments. We have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and record changes in its fair value in AOCI. As of
December 31, 2012
, the fair value of the swap agreement is a
$2 million
liability. The net effect of this swap is to convert the
$1 billion
floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate obligation bearing a rate of
0.922 percent
.
At the acquisition date, we assumed
$1 billion
of outstanding National debt with a fair value of
$1.105 billion
. The excess of the fair value over the stated value is amortized as a reduction of Interest and debt expense over the term of the related debt. In
2012
and
2011
, we amortized
$26 million
and
$9 million
, respectively. During
2012
, we repaid
$375 million
of this debt.
Total long-term debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
is as follows:
Interest and debt expense was
$85 million
in
2012
and
$42 million
in
2011
. This was net of the amortization of the debt premium and other debt issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were
$97 million
in
2012
and
$54 million
in
2011
. Capitalized interest was not material.
33
13. Commitments and contingencies
Operating leases
We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal provisions and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Rental and lease expense incurred was
$124 million
,
$109 million
and
$100 million
in
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Capitalized software licenses
We have licenses for certain internal-use electronic design automation software that we account for as capital leases. The related liabilities are apportioned between Accounts payable and Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets, depending on the contractual timing of payments.
 
Purchase commitments
Some of our purchase commitments entered in the ordinary course of business provide for minimum payments. At
December 31, 2012
, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases, capitalized software licenses and purchase commitments:
Indemnification guarantees
We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate or accrue for any future liabilities that may result.
 
Warranty costs/product liabilities
We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Consistent with general industry practice, we enter into formal contracts with certain customers that include negotiated warranty remedies. Typically, under these agreements our warranty for semiconductor products includes
three years of coverage; an obligation to repair, replace or refund; and a maximum payment obligation tied to the price paid for our products
. In some cases, product claims may exceed the price of our products.
General
We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we also negotiate contingent consideration payment arrangements associated with certain acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value.
Discontinued operations indemnity
In connection with the 2006 sale of the former Sensors & Controls (S&C) business, we have agreed to indemnify Sensata Technologies, Inc., for specified litigation matters and certain liabilities, including environmental liabilities. In a settlement with a third party, we have agreed to indemnify that party for certain events relating to S&C products, which events we consider remote. We believe our total remaining potential exposure from both of these indemnities will not exceed
$200 million
. As of
December 31, 2012
, we believe future payments related to these indemnity obligations will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
14. Stockholders equity
We are authorized to issue
10,000,000
shares of preferred stock.
No
preferred stock is currently outstanding.

Reportable segments
Our financial reporting structure is comprised of
two
reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. These reportable segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. A summary of each reportable segment follows:
The information presented in our Notes to financial statements has been recast to reflect our elimination of the Wireless segment, which was effective January 1, 2013. Financial results for embedded OMAP applications processors and embedded connectivity products (formerly Wireless products), both of which have many of the same characteristics as the products in our Embedded Processing segment, are reported in that segment. Financial results for baseband products and Wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets, both of which are product lines that we have announced we are exiting, are included in Other. We refer to those exited product lines collectively as legacy wireless products. We also reclassified certain product lines, primarily radio frequency identification (RFID) products, from Other to Embedded Processing.
Other
Other includes other operating segments that neither meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments nor are they aggregated with other operating segments. These operating segments primarily include our smaller product lines such as DLP products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and calculators.
In addition to revenue from our legacy wireless products, Other also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures. Other may also include certain unallocated income and expenses such as gains and losses on sales of assets; sales tax refunds; and certain litigation costs, settlements or reserves. Except for these few unallocated items, we allocate all of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.  
Acquisition-related charges related to National are also recorded in Other in
2012
and
2011
, as detailed in Note 2.
Restructuring charges related to the 2012 Wireless action and the
2011
announced action in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas; losses and insurance proceeds associated with the
2011
earthquake in Japan; and the 2012 gain on the transfer of the Japan substitutional pension are also included in Other. In
2010
, the gain related to a divestiture of a product line is included in Other. See Notes 3 and 4 for additional information.
We use centralized manufacturing and facilities organizations to provide products and support to our operating segments. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and therefore is not provided.
With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. There was no significant intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. All dollar amounts in the tables in this discussion are stated in millions of U.S. dollars, except per-share amounts.
Overview
At TI, we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We began operations in 1930. We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries. We have three segments: Analog, Embedded Processing and Other. We expect Analog and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and we therefore focus our resources on these segments.
We were the world's fourth largest semiconductor company in 2012 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from an external source.
Financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned Segment and geographic area data and is incorporated herein by reference.
Product information
Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as chips) that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit.
Our products, more than 100,000 orderable parts, are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment.
We sell catalog and, to a lesser extent, custom semiconductor products. Catalog products are designed for use by many customers and/or many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels. The majority of our catalog products are proprietary, but some are commodity products. The life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years, with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release. Custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application, are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer. The life cycles of custom products are generally determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months.
Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. Additional information regarding each segment's products follows.
Analog
Analog semiconductors change real-world signals - such as sound, temperature, pressure or images - by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as digital signal processors (DSPs). Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device, whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery. We estimate that we sell our Analog products to more than 100,000 customers. These sales generated about 55 percent of our revenue in 2012. According to external sources, the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about $39 billion in 2012. Our Analog segment's revenue in 2012 was about $7.0 billion, or about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position. We believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.
Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA).
HVAL products: These include both high-volume analog and logic products. High-volume analog includes integrated analog products for specific applications, including custom products. End markets for high-volume analog products include communications, automotive, computing and many consumer electronics products. Logic includes some commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications.
39
Power products: These include both catalog and application-specific products that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system. We design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices (battery-powered devices, such as handheld consumer electronics, laptop computers and cordless power tools) and line-powered systems (products that require an external electrical source, such as computers, digital TVs, wireless basestations and high-voltage industrial equipment).
HPA products: These include catalog analog products, such as amplifiers, data converters and interface semiconductors, that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets, including the industrial, communications, computing and consumer electronics markets. HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.
SVA products: These consist of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) in 2011. These include power management, data converter, interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products, nearly all of which are complementary to our other Analog products. This portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets. SVA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.
Embedded Processing
Embedded Processing products are the brains of many electronic devices. Compared with general purpose microprocessors that perform many different tasks, embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. The devices vary from simple, low-cost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many end markets, particularly industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure.
An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.
Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 18 percent of our revenue in 2012. According to external sources, the worldwide market for embedded processors was about $17 billion in 2012. Our Embedded Processing segment's revenue in 2012 was about $2.3 billion. This was the number two position and represented about 13 percent of this fragmented market. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.
Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity.
Processor products: These include DSPs and applications processors. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors like our embedded OMAP
TM
and Sitara
TM
products run an industry-standard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks, often communicating with other systems.
Microcontroller products: Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system and low software complexity. Analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers. Microcontroller products also include radio frequency identification (RFID) products, which are frequently used in automotive applications and sold along with our microcontroller products.
Connectivity products: Connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data, and the requirements for speed, data capability, distance and power vary depending on the application. Our Connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements, including low-power wireless network standards like Zigbee
and other technologies like Bluetooth
, WiFi, GPS and Near Field Communications. Our Connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products, enabling data to be collected, transmitted and acted upon.
40
Other
Other includes revenue from our smaller product lines, such as DLP
(primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and calculators. It includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures. We also include revenue, about $1.2 billion in 2012, from our baseband products and from our OMAP applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphone and consumer tablet applications, all of which are product lines that we have previously announced we are exiting. We expect this revenue to substantially cease by the end of 2013. Other generated about $3.6 billion in 2012.
We also include in Other restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related charges that are not used in evaluating results of and allocating resources to our Analog and Embedded Processing segments. These acquisition-related charges include certain fair-value adjustments, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, acquisition-related retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets. Other also includes certain corporate-level items, such as litigation and environmental costs, insurance proceeds, and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations, such as our worldwide manufacturing, facilities and procurement operations.
Inventory
Our inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand. Because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence, we generally carry more inventory of those products than custom products. Additionally, we sometimes maintain catalog-product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished-goods inventory of low-volume products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand. We also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors.
Manufacturing
Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is tested, the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks, with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks.
The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology. Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable, and therefore less expensive, equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced CMOS logic products, such as our OMAP products.
We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity, potentially hurting our profit margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.
We expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs. To supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2012, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers and about 75 percent of our advanced CMOS logic needs from external foundries.
In 2011, we initiated closure of an older wafer fabrication facility in Hiji, Japan, and another in Houston, Texas. We expect to complete these plant closures in 2013.
Product cycle
The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes. Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature.
41
Market cycle
The semiconductor cycle is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. The semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
Seasonality
Our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation. Our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second and third quarters, as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons. Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters.
Tax considerations
We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to several types of taxes including those that are based on income, capital, property and payroll, as well as sales and other transactional taxes. The timing of the final determination of our tax liabilities varies by jurisdiction and taxing authority. As a result, during any particular reporting period we may reflect in our financial statements one or more tax refunds or assessments, or changes to tax liabilities, involving one or more taxing authorities.
Results of operations
The information presented in this Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) has been recast to reflect our elimination, effective January 1, 2013, of the Wireless segment. As previously announced, we now focus our OMAP applications processors and connectivity products (formerly Wireless products) on embedded applications with long life cycles. Financial results for embedded OMAP applications processors and embedded connectivity products, both of which have many of the same characteristics as the products in our Embedded Processing segment, are now reported in that segment. Financial results for baseband products and Wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets, both of which are product lines that we have announced we are exiting, are included in Other and are referred to collectively as legacy wireless products. We also reclassified certain product lines, primarily radio frequency identification (RFID) products, from Other to Embedded Processing. Revenue from those reclassified product lines was about $130 million in 2012.
Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. New products tend not to have a significant impact because our revenue is derived from such a large number of products. From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the mix of products shipped.
2012 compared with 2011
During 2012, we faced a weak demand environment, but our operations performed well and we strengthened our strategic position.  We reached a milestone in 2012, with 72 percent of our revenue coming from our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing.  Also during the year, we successfully integrated National into our operations and increased the diversity of our customer base, especially in the industrial sector.  Despite lower revenue that resulted primarily from our exit from baseband products, we grew our free cash flow to almost $3 billion, or 23 percent of revenue.  Our free cash flow was the result of more of our revenue coming from Analog and Embedded Processing, which offer solid growth and high margins and have low capital needs.  We returned 90 percent of this free cash flow to stockholders through our continued share repurchases and higher dividend payments.  Free cash flow will continue to benefit from our strategic purchases of manufacturing capacity during the past few years. (Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of the purpose for providing this non-GAAP measure, see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section.)
42
Details of 2012 financial results
Revenue in 2012 was $12.82 billion, down $910 million, or 7 percent, from 2011 primarily due to a weak demand environment. Revenue from a full year's inclusion of SVA slightly more than offset lower revenue from wireless baseband products.
Gross profit in 2012 was $6.37 billion, a decrease of $404 million, or 6 percent, from 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin in 2012 was 49.6 percent of revenue compared with 49.3 percent in 2011.
Operating expenses were $1.88 billion for R&D and $1.80 billion for SG&A. R&D expense increased $162 million, or 9 percent, from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA. R&D expense as a percent of revenue was 14.6 percent compared with 12.5 percent in 2011. SG&A expense increased $166 million, or 10 percent, from 2011 due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was 14.1 percent compared with 11.9 percent in 2011.
Acquisition charges related to the National acquisition were $450 million in 2012 and $315 million in 2011. The increase was due to a full year of amortization of acquired intangible assets. See Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements for details.
Restructuring charges/other were $264 million in 2012 and $112 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the restructuring of our former Wireless segment, partially offset by a $144 million gain we recognized from the transfer of the obligations and assets of a portion of our Japan pension program from the pension trust to the government of Japan. See Note 3 to the financial statements for details.
43
Operating profit was $1.97 billion, or 15.4 percent of revenue, compared with $2.99 billion, or 21.8 percent of revenue, in 2011. The decrease was due to, in decreasing order, lower gross profit, higher operating expenses, higher restructuring charges and higher acquisition charges.
OI&E for 2012 was income of $47 million compared with $5 million for 2011. The increase was primarily due to tax-related interest income.
Interest and debt expense was $85 million compared with $42 million in the year-ago period. The increase over 2011 was primarily due to having debt outstanding for a full year in 2012 compared with about eight months in 2011. We issued debt in May 2011 and assumed debt in September 2011, both in connection with our acquisition of National. See Note 12 to the financial statements for details.
The annual effective tax rate for 2012 was 22 percent. Taxes at this rate were reduced by discrete tax benefits of $252 million, resulting in a total tax provision for 2012 of $176 million compared with a total tax provision of $719 million for the prior year. The decrease in the total tax provision was due to the combination of lower income before income taxes and the impact of the discrete tax benefits. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of the expiration of the federal research tax credit at the end of 2011. The discrete tax benefits in 2012 were primarily due to additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2011. The tax provision for 2012 did not include the January 2013 reinstatement of the federal research tax credit. The effect of the reinstatement of about $65 million for 2012 will be recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013.
See Note 7 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of effective tax rates to the statutory federal tax rate.
Net income was $1.76 billion, a decrease of $477 million, or 21 percent, from 2011. EPS for 2012 was $1.51 compared with $1.88 for 2011. The decline in EPS was due to lower net income. EPS benefitted $0.03 from 2011 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program.
Segment results
A detailed discussion of our segment results appears below.
Analog
Analog revenue increased $623 million, or 10 percent, from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA, and to a lesser extent, growth in Power Management. Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue from High Performance Analog. Revenue from High Volume Analog & Logic products was about even.
Operating profit was $1.65 billion, or 23.6 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $43 million, or 3 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to higher operating expenses from the inclusion of a full year of SVA, partially offset by higher gross profit.
Embedded Processing
44
Embedded Processing revenue decreased $124 million, or 5 percent, compared with 2011 due to lower revenue from Processor products and, to a lesser extent, a less favorable mix of Microcontroller products. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from Connectivity products.
 
Operating profit was $158 million, or 7.0 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $229 million, or 59 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to lower gross profit, and to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses.
Other
* Included in Operating profit
Revenue from Other was $3.57 billion in 2012. This was a decrease of $1.41 billion, or 28 percent, from 2011 primarily due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products. Also contributing to the decline were the expiration of transitional supply agreements, a less favorable mix of DLP products and lower revenue from calculators and royalties. The decrease was partially offset by business interruption insurance proceeds resulting from the 2011 Japan earthquake and increased revenue from custom ASIC products.
Operating profit for 2012 from Other was $165 million, or 4.6 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $747 million, or 82 percent, compared with 2011 due to lower revenue and associated gross profit and higher restructuring and acquisition charges. Included in Restructuring charges/other for 2012 was a $144 million gain from the Japan pension program change. The increase in acquisition charges was due to a full year of increased amortization expense for acquired intangible assets.
Prior results of operations - 2011 compared with 2010
Our 2011 revenue was $13.73 billion, net income was $2.24 billion and EPS was $1.88.
Although 2011 started strong, global economic uncertainty and the March 2011 earthquake in Japan impacted TI, our customers and our suppliers.  Despite these challenges, we successfully completed the acquisition of National, we gained share in the Analog and Embedded Processing markets, and we continued to wind down our baseband operations.
Revenue in 2011 was $13.73 billion, down $231 million, or 2 percent, from 2010 due to lower revenue from wireless baseband products.
Gross profit in 2011 was $6.77 billion, a decrease of $720 million, or 10 percent, from 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a combination of, in decreasing order, lower revenue, lower average levels of factory utilization as we reduced production in response to weaker demand, acquisition-related charges reflected in COR and inventory charges. Lower factory utilization decreased our gross profit by $175 million from 2010. Gross profit margin was 49.3 percent of revenue compared with 53.6 percent in 2010.
Operating expenses were $1.72 billion for R&D and $1.64 billion for SG&A. R&D expense increased $145 million, or 9 percent, from 2010 primarily due to the addition of a partial year of SVA and higher product development costs in Embedded Processing and our other major Analog product lines. R&D expense as a percent of revenue was 12.5 percent compared with 11.2 percent in 2010.
SG&A expense increased $119 million, or 8 percent, from 2010 primarily due to the addition of a partial year of SVA, and to a lesser extent, higher investments in sales and marketing in support of our other major Analog product lines and Embedded Processing. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was 11.9 percent compared with 10.9 percent in 2010.
 
Acquisition charges were $315 million in 2011. There were no acquisition charges in 2010.
45
Restructuring charges/other of $112 million for 2011 were associated with the action initiated to close certain manufacturing facilities in Texas and Japan. Restructuring charges/other for 2010 included $33 million of restructuring charges associated with pension benefit settlements related to actions taken in 2009, offset by a gain of $144 million from the divestiture of a product line included in Other.
Operating profit was $2.99 billion, or 21.8 percent of revenue, compared with $4.51 billion, or 32.3 percent of revenue, in 2010. The decrease was due to, in decreasing order, lower gross profit, higher total acquisition-related charges, higher operating expenses and a gain on the divestiture of a product line in 2010.
OI&E for 2011 was income of $5 million. This was $32 million lower than in 2010 due to an expense in 2011 associated with a settlement related to a divested business.
Interest and debt expense was $42 million. This included interest and amortization of debt expense associated with our issuance of new debt in 2011 and the assumption of debt as a result of our acquisition of National.
  
The tax provision for 2011 was $719 million compared with $1.32 billion for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower income before income taxes.
Net income was $2.24 billion, a decrease of $992 million from 2010. EPS for 2011 was $1.88 compared with $2.62 for 2010. EPS benefited $0.07 from 2010 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program.
Segment results
A detailed discussion of our segment results appears below.
Analog
* Included in Operating profit
Analog revenue increased $396 million, or 7 percent, from 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of a partial year of SVA, and to a lesser extent, increased shipments of Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic products. Partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue from High Performance Analog due to normal price declines.
Operating profit was $1.69 billion, or 26.6 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $183 million, or 10 percent, compared with 2010 due to higher operating expenses from the inclusion of a partial year of SVA and, to a lesser extent, lower gross profit resulting from lower factory utilization.
Embedded Processing
* Included in Operating profit
46
Embedded Processing revenue was about even compared with 2010. Increased revenue from Microcontroller, and to a lesser extent, Connectivity, products were offset by lower revenue from Processor products.
Operating profit was $387 million, or 16.3 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $147 million, or 28 percent, compared with 2010 primarily due to lower gross profit, and to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses. Lower gross profit was primarily due to the effect of the mix of products, and to a lesser extent, lower factory utilization.
Other
* Included in Operating profit
Revenue from Other was $4.98 billion in 2011. This was a decrease of $649 million, or 12 percent, from 2010 due to decreased shipments across most areas.
Operating profit for 2011 from Other was $912 million, or 18.3 percent of revenue. This was a decrease of $1.19 billion, or 57 percent, compared with 2010 due to lower revenue and associated gross profit; charges associated with the National acquisition; the absence of a gain on divestiture; restructuring charges related to the action initiated in 2011 to close certain manufacturing facilities in Texas and Japan; and the net losses associated with the Japan earthquake.
Restructuring Action
In November 2012, we announced that we would restructure our Wireless business to focus investments on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth.  Specifically, we now focus our OMAP applications processors and connectivity products on embedded applications with long life cycles instead of on the smartphone and consumer tablet markets, where large customers are increasingly developing their own custom chips.  These changes will result in lower resource and investment demands.  As a result of the restructuring, we recorded a $351 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, of which $245 million was for severance and benefit costs and $106 million was for non-cash items, which includes a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment of $90 million. We expect about 1,700 jobs to be eliminated and about $450 million in annualized cost savings to be realized by the time this action is completed in 2013.
For more information on the restructuring action, see Note 3 to the financial statements.
Financial condition
At the end of 2012, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $3.96 billion, an increase of $1.03 billion from the end of 2011.
Accounts receivable were $1.23 billion at the end of 2012. This was a decrease of $315 million compared with the end of 2011. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to lower revenue in December 2012 than in December 2011. Days sales outstanding were 37 at the end of 2012 compared with 41 at the end of 2011.
Inventory was $1.76 billion at the end of 2012. This was a decrease of $31 million from the end of 2011. Days of inventory at the end of 2012 were 103 compared with 86 at the end of 2011. Our days of inventory increased in order to support higher customer service levels.
47
Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and revolving credit facilities. Cash flow from operations for 2012 was $3.41 billion, an increase of $158 million from the prior year due to an increase in cash provided by working capital.
We had $1.416 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.549 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2012.
We have a variable-rate revolving credit facility with a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2017. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
In 2012, investing activities used $1.04 billion. This compares with $6.17 billion used in 2011 primarily for the National acquisition, net of cash acquired. See Note 2 to the financial statements for details. For 2012, capital expenditures (Additions to property, plant and equipment) were $495 million compared with $816 million in 2011. Capital expenditures in 2012 were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. We used cash of $604 million to make net purchases of short-term investments in 2012 compared with $98 million in 2011.
In 2012, financing activities used net cash of $1.95 billion and provided $2.59 billion in 2011. In 2012, we received proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt (net of original issuance discount). This compares with proceeds in 2011 of $3.50 billion we received from the issuance of fixed- and variable-rate long-term debt (net of the original issuance discount) and $1.20 billion from the issuance of commercial paper. The 2011 issuance of long-term debt was used in the National acquisition. The commercial paper was issued for general corporate purposes and to maintain cash balances at desired levels. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional details. We used $1.38 billion to repay debt and commercial paper in 2012 compared with $200 million used to repay commercial paper in 2011. Dividends paid in 2012 of $819 million compared with $644 million in 2011, reflecting increases in the dividend rate in each year. In September 2012, we announced a 24 percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly dividend increased from $0.17 to $0.21 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $0.84 per share. We used $1.80 billion to repurchase 59.8 million shares of our common stock in 2012 compared with $1.97 billion used to repurchase 59.5 million shares in 2011. Employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in cash from financing activities. In 2012, these exercises provided cash proceeds of $523 million compared with $690 million in 2011.
We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Non-GAAP financial information
This MD&A includes a discussion of free cash flow, a measure that was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (non-GAAP measure).  We provide this measure to give investors insight into the company's liquidity and cash-generating capability and the amount of its cash available to return to investors. It is supplemental to the comparable GAAP measure.
Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (Additions to property, plant and equipment) from Cash flows from operating activities.  The components of this calculation are included in the table below.  
48
Long-term contractual obligations
(a) Long-term debt obligations include amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, i.e., obligations that will be retired within 12 months. The related interest payments are not included.
(f) Excluded from the table are $184 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned, future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $100 million in 2013, but funding projections beyond 2013 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation.
Critical accounting policies
In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, is recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, the sales amounts are fixed or determinable, and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations.
We reduce revenue based on estimates of future credits to be granted to customers. Credits include volume-based incentives, other special pricing arrangements and product returns due to quality issues. Our estimates of future credits are based on historical experience, analysis of product shipments and contractual arrangements with customers and distributors.
In 2012, about 50 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors. We recognize distributor revenue net of allowances, which are management's estimates based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. These allowances recognize the impact of credits granted to distributors under certain programs
49
common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities, or are allowed to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory, or other incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities. Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity. About 40 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory, and we expect this proportion to grow over time. The allowances we record against this revenue are not material.
 
In addition, we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made.
Income taxes
In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.
In addition to the factors described above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates. Retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item.
 
Inventory valuation allowances
Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Allowances are determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual materials and parts to historical usage rates, current backlog and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age of inventory, in order to identify specific components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products. In addition to this specific identification process, statistical allowances are calculated for remaining inventory based on historical write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.
Impairment of acquisition-related intangibles
and goodwill
We review acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered include the underperformance of an asset compared with expectations and shortened useful lives due to planned changes in the use of the assets. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value, determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Additionally, in the case of intangible assets that will continue to be used in future periods, a
50
shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized.
We review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise, such as significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. This impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions. We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable.
Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing.
Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting requires that we recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the acquisition date net fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
The measurement of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires considerable judgment. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, those determinations are usually based on significant estimates provided by management, such as forecasted revenue or profit. In determining the fair value of intangible assets, an income approach is generally used and may incorporate the use of a discounted cash flow method. In applying the discounted cash flow method, the estimated future cash flows and residual values for each intangible asset are discounted to a present value using a discount rate based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for the semiconductor industry. These cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of economic and market conditions including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
While we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which occurs before finalization of the purchase price allocation, changes in assumptions and estimates that result in adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on a retrospective basis as of the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to our Consolidated statements of income. The measurement period for the National acquisition concluded on December 31, 2011.
Changes in accounting standards
As of December 31, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board had issued several accounting standards that we have not yet been required to adopt.  None of these standards would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or financial disclosures
.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of December 31, 2012, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Commitments and contingencies

In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

indemnifying party
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VI under the first or second paragraphs hereof is unavailable in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VI were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VI are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VI and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
In further consideration of the agreements of the Company herein contained, each Underwriter severally covenants as follows:
(a) Not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(b) Not to use, refer to or distribute any free writing prospectus except (i) a free writing prospectus that (A) is not an issuer free writing prospectus and (B) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Offered Securities or the offering thereof, which information is limited to the categories of terms referenced on Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement or otherwise permitted under Rule 134 of the Securities Act, (ii) a free writing prospectus as shall be agreed in writing with the Company that is not distributed, used or referred to by such Underwriter in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination (unless the Company consents in writing to such dissemination) or (iii) a free writing prospectus identified in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement as forming part of the Time of Sale Prospectus.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Manager's absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the Applicable Time and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the The NASDAQ Stock Market or in the U.S. over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or a severe deterioration in U.S. financial markets or any other calamity or crisis that is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clause (a)(i), such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the Manager's judgment, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and this Agreement. Any such termination of this Agreement shall be without liability on the part of any Manager or on the part of the Company except as stated in Article IX.
 
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, none of the Underwriters is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Offered Securities contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section VI hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by the Depositary, in the case of Notes represented by a Global Note, or by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of Notes that are not represented by a Global Note.
7. Defaults and Remedies.
If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
8. Authentication.
This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.
9. Abbreviations and Defined Terms.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Note or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
10. CUSIP Numbers.
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Notes and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for Texas Instruments Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.000% Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and together with the 2018 Notes, the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 1, 2013 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the "Representatives"), as representatives of the several underwriters listed in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 23, 2011 (the "Indenture") by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, and an Officer's Certificate to be issued pursuant thereto on or about May 8, 2013. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-186803, the "Registration Statement") for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
We, as your counsel, have examined originals or copies of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have, without independent inquiry or investigation, assumed that (i) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, (ii) all documents submitted to us as copies conform to authentic, complete originals, (iii) all documents filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that have not been executed will conform to the forms thereof, (iv) all signatures on all documents that we reviewed are genuine, (v) all natural persons executing documents had and have the legal capacity to do so, (vi) all statements in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company that we reviewed were and are accurate and (vii) all representations made by the Company as to matters of fact in the documents that we reviewed were and are accurate.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the additional assumptions and qualifications set forth below, we advise you that, in our opinion, the Notes have been duly authorized in accordance with the Indenture, and, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, such Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability.
In connection with the opinions expressed above, we have assumed that (i) the Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission and such effectiveness shall not have been terminated or rescinded; and (ii) at or prior to the time of the delivery of the Notes, the Indenture and the Notes are each valid, binding and enforceable agreements of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company). We have also assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Notes (a) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any public policy, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company.
We are members of the Bars of the States of New York and California and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on the date hereof and further consent to the reference to our name under the caption "Validity of Securities" in the base prospectus and supplement thereto, which are a part of the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
Very truly yours,
