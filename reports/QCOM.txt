     In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216, the following information, which is intended to be furnished under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition," is instead being furnished under Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure."
     On April 23, 2003, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2003. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1 QUALCOMM Contact: Julie Cunningham Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4224 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail: juliec@qualcomm.com QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2003 RESULTS REVENUES $1.0 BILLION AND EPS $0.13 REVENUES $1.0 BILLION AND EPS $0.38, EXCLUDING QSI SEGMENT SAN DIEGO - April 23, 2003 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced its second quarter fiscal 2003 results ended March 30, 2003. Revenues were $1.0 billion in the second fiscal quarter, up 50 percent year-over-year, primarily due to increasing demand for CDMA products across global markets. Second quarter net income was $103 million, up 135 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share were $0.13, up 160 percent from $0.05 in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Second quarter net income includes $160 million in asset impairment charges related to Vesper. Following the recent denial of Vesper's request by the Brazilian regulator to use mobile service in the 1900 MHz frequencies band, we have decided to pursue an expedited exit strategy, including the sale or other disposition of Vesper and/or its assets. The impairment loss recognized is the difference between the carrying values of Vesper's long-lived assets and their estimated fair market values. Revenues excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment were $1.0 billion in the second fiscal quarter, up 54 percent year-over-year. Net income excluding the QSI segment was $314 million, up 95 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share excluding the QSI segment were $0.38, up 90 percent year-over-year. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are listed in this release with more detailed information for the prior periods presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. "During the March quarter, we exceeded our earnings target and delivered excellent year-over-year growth. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $460 million in the second fiscal quarter including the effect of initiating our first-ever stock repurchase program," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "New CDMA2000 1X networks were launched by operators in China, India, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Brazil, and new - more -
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 2 of 16 WCDMA networks were recently launched in Japan, Italy, the U.K. and Australia. The highest-speed commercial 3G data networks, based on our CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology, are generating substantial increases in subscriber revenues for operators in South Korea. Several new 1xEV-DO networks are expected to be launched in the coming months, together with exciting new applications, including streaming video. Seven operators in six nations have now commercially deployed a broad selection of BREW-based applications and services, including Vivo, the joint venture of Telefonica Moviles and Portugal Telecom in Brazil. Despite these many positive developments, we were disappointed by the Brazilian regulator's denial of Vesper's request to provide full mobility service, a request we believe was in accordance with previous regulation and one which would have greatly benefited subscribers in Brazil. As a result, we have initiated efforts to exit our Vesper investment and realize the maximum value possible from its assets." Research and development (R&D) expenses were $132 million, including $2 million for QSI, in the second fiscal quarter, up 13 percent year-over year. The increase in R&D expenses compared to the year ago quarter was primarily related to QCT product initiatives. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $136 million, including $19 million for QSI, in the second fiscal quarter, up 9 percent year-over-year. The increase in SG&A expense compared to the year ago quarter was primarily due to an increase in employee and other expenses related to the expansion of the QCT customer base and our support and marketing efforts related to the BREW(TM) application development platform. Our fiscal 2003 effective income tax rate is now estimated to be 43 percent, compared to 36 percent in fiscal 2002. Excluding the QSI segment, our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate is now estimated to be 33 percent, due to increased foreign sales at lower tax rates, compared to 35 percent in fiscal 2002. The change in the estimated 2003 effective tax rate excluding QSI required an adjustment from the 34 percent effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, resulting in a 32 percent effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company also reversed approximately $1.1 billion of its valuation allowance on substantially all of its U.S. deferred tax assets during the three months ended March 30, 2003 as a credit to stockholders' equity.
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 3 of 16 QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses, including the Vesper Companies in Brazil. QSI revenues, which are primarily related to the consolidation of the Vesper Companies, were $26 million in the second fiscal quarter, down 10 percent sequentially. QSI losses before taxes were $246 million in the second fiscal quarter. This includes Vesper related losses of $188 million, which consist primarily of $160 million of asset impairment charges and $22 million of losses from operations (net of minority interest). The balance of the QSI losses before taxes is primarily our share of equity losses from our investment in Inquam of $33 million and other-than-temporary losses on investments of $24 million. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2003 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the third fiscal quarter will increase by approximately 27 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.30-$0.31 in the third fiscal quarter, an increase of approximately 25-29 percent year-over-year. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 23 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. This would represent a 44 percent growth in MSM chip shipments year-over-year. Approximately 96 percent of chip shipments in the third fiscal quarter are expected to be 3G CDMA2000 MSM phone chips. - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the third quarter will increase by approximately 24 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.23 in the third fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.08 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to a $0.02 loss per share in the year ago quarter. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 4 of 16 vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. FISCAL 2003 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 30-33 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.38-$1.41 for fiscal 2003, up 41-44 percent year-over-year, exceeding our previous guidance. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 103-110 million units in calendar 2003 with a decrease of approximately 10 percent in average selling prices of CDMA phones, upon which royalties are calculated. - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 27-30 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84-$0.87 for fiscal 2003, up 91-98 percent year-over-year, including an estimated $0.54 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $3.9 billion on December 29, 2002 and $3.2 billion on September 29, 2002. Our previously announced stock repurchase program was initiated in the second fiscal quarter utilizing $124 million in the quarter. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment are presented in this release.
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 5 of 16 RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT SEGMENT INFORMATION (IN THOUSANDS): Second Quarter - Fiscal Year 2003 First Quarter - Fiscal Year 2003 Second Quarter - Fiscal Year 2002 Six Months - Fiscal Year 2003 Six Months - Fiscal Year 2002
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 6 of 16 (1) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (2) Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $61.1 million of amortization of goodwill, $3.1 million of amortization of intangible assets and $1.0 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, offset by $0.1 million of credits related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business and $0.7 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business. In the first six months of fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $122.3 million of amortization of goodwill, $6.1 million of amortization of intangible assets and $3.1 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, offset by $0.1 million of credits related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business and $2.1 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business. With the adoption of FAS 142 in 2003 and given the immateriality of the other adjustments, the Company no longer makes these adjustments to its results excluding QSI in fiscal 2003. (3) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding. N/M - Not Meaningful BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS QUALCOMM CDMA TECHNOLOGIES (QCT) - Shipped approximately 28 million MSM(TM) phone chips to customers worldwide during the second fiscal quarter, up from approximately 14 million units in the year ago quarter. - Shipped approximately 25 million 3G CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO MSM phone chips during the second fiscal quarter for a cumulative total of nearly 94 million 3G CDMA2000 MSM phone chips. - Shipped CSM infrastructure chips for 3G CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO to support more than 1.5 million equivalent voice channels, down from approximately 2.5 million in the year ago quarter. - Announced that more than 10 million gpsOne(TM)-enabled devices are now in commercial use in Japan, South Korea and the United States, making QUALCOMM's gpsOne technology the world's most widely deployed personal location system. - Announced strong market demand for the advanced multimedia MSM6100(TM) chipset solution. A total of eight handset manufacturers, including Curitel, Kyocera, LG Electronics, Motorola, Samsung Electronics, Sharp Corporation, Synertek and Toshiba, covering 22 separate planned device designs, have already begun to take receipt of shipments of the MSM6100 chipset in order to support rollouts of these new devices this year.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of

The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
     In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216, the following information, which is intended to be furnished under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition," is instead being furnished under Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure."
     On July 23, 2003, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2003. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable debt securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.

Revenues were $922 million in the third fiscal quarter, up 20 percent year-over-year. Third quarter net income was $192 million, compared to a loss of $14 million year-over-year. Earnings per share were $0.23, compared to a loss of $0.02 per share year-over-year. Revenues excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment were $891 million in the third fiscal quarter, up 24 percent year-over-year. Net income excluding the QSI segment was $267 million, up 38 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share excluding the QSI segment were $0.33, up 38 percent year-over-year. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. "Our business generates excellent positive cash flows at the same time revenues and earnings continue to grow. As a result, our Board approved a 40 percent increase in cash dividends to return value to our shareholders," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "During the third quarter, we announced several new multimode chips and the industry-leading MSM7xxx family of chips to further strengthen our product road map and support our customers." "The China and India markets are gaining momentum, and we are encouraged by the performance of CDMA operators in the Americas, Japan and South Korea. During the quarter, Reliance Infocomm launched the first CDMA2000 1X nationwide commercial service in India, bringing advanced 3G wireless voice and data services to more than 250 cities. Reliance, Tata and the other CDMA operators in India totaled over three million subscribers at the end of June. China Unicom launched its prepaid service in several cities. VIVO in Brazil and China Unicom launched commercial - more -

Verizon Wireless in the U.S. reported impressive data revenues with its BREW-based Get It Now(sm) service. We believe these events, along with initial deployments of WCDMA in Japan and Europe, will set the stage for CDMA to capture a greater share of the total wireless market over the next year," Jacobs said. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $136 million, including $1 million for QSI, in the third fiscal quarter, up 15 percent year-over year. The increase in R&D expenses compared to the year ago quarter was primarily related to QCT new product development efforts. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $117 million, including $8 million for QSI, in the third fiscal quarter, down 23 percent year-over-year. The decrease in SG&A expense compared to the year ago quarter was primarily due to reduced expenses at Vesper, including the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Our fiscal 2003 effective income tax rate is now estimated to be 45 percent, compared to 22 percent in fiscal 2002. The change in the estimated 2003 effective tax rate from 43 percent used in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 results in a 48 percent effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Excluding the QSI segment, our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate estimate remains at 33 percent, compared to 35 percent in fiscal 2002. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. Vesper losses before taxes were $20 million in the third fiscal quarter compared to $35 million in the year ago quarter. The balance of the net loss before taxes in QSI was $7 million for the third fiscal quarter compared to $250 million in the year ago quarter. The third quarter of fiscal 2003 net loss included asset impairment charges related to the valuation of our Australian wireless licenses, other-than-temporary losses on investments, our share of equity losses from our investment in Inquam and impairment of a note receivable. Significant offsetting gains included the realization of value of a portion of our Auction Discount Voucher transferred to two wireless operators, realized interest income from our Pegaso investment and realized gains on the sale of marketable securities.
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 3 of 18 BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2003 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the fourth fiscal quarter will increase by approximately 2-6 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.27-$0.29 in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to $0.31 in the year ago quarter. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 19-21 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the fourth quarter will increase by approximately 2-6 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.19-$0.21 in the fourth fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.08 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to $0.23 per share in the year ago quarter. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. FISCAL 2003 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 31-33 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.40-$1.42 for fiscal 2003, up 43-45 percent year-over-year. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 103-108 million units in calendar 2003, and we estimate a decrease of approximately five percent in average selling prices of CDMA phones for fiscal 2003, upon which royalties are calculated.
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 4 of 18 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 30-31 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84-$0.86 for fiscal 2003, up 91-95 percent year-over-year, including an estimated $0.56 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $4.4 billion on March 30, 2003, $3.9 billion on December 29, 2002 and $3.2 billion on September 29, 2002. We have invested $158 million in net stock repurchases and have paid $79 million in cash dividends since the inception of these programs in February 2003. QSI businesses required funding of $40 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Collection of finance receivables from our Pegaso investment totaled $285 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment are included at the end of this news release.

QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2003 Results Page 6 of 18 (1) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (2) Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $61.5 million of amortization of goodwill, $4.0 million of amortization of intangible assets and $2.3 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, offset by $1.0 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business and $0.2 million of credits and $0.1 million of revenues related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business. In the first nine months of fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $183.8 million of amortization of goodwill, $10.1 million of amortization of intangible assets and $5.4 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, offset by $3.1 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business and $0.3 million of credits and $0.1 million of revenue related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business. With the adoption of FAS 142 in 2003 and given the immateriality of the other adjustments, the Company no longer makes these adjustments to its results excluding QSI in fiscal 2003. (3) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding.

QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI and between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented herein. NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: changing global economic conditions, particularly in the telecommunications and Internet-related industries and the resulting uncertainty in forecasting future results; timing and receipt of license fees and royalties; integrated circuit inventory and order levels; the Company's ability to execute additional 3G licenses; the scale-up, acceptance and operations of CDMA systems, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and systems in new markets such as China and India; the ability to sustain or improve operational efficiency and profitability; decreases in the rate of growth in CDMA-based wireless data and Internet access or the CDMA subscriber population; strategic investments, loans, acquisitions or divestitures the Company has or may pursue; the value realized on the sale of the Vesper Companies' business or assets; changes in the fair values of marketable securities and derivative instruments held; the development, deployment and

If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.

Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable debt securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields.

We expect to see increased royalty revenue with the deployment of WCDMA beginning to ramp, and are also well positioned to win a significant share of the WCDMA chip business and further expand the BREW footprint. BREW has already been adopted by 10 wireless operators in seven countries, and consumers have completed over 50 million downloads of BREW applications developed by the BREW global developer community." "In 2004, we look forward to the world continuing its migration to the most economic wireless platform, CDMA. As additional operators launch CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO and WCDMA, there will be an ever increasing need for multimode multiband handsets to enable true global roaming. In response to market demands, we plan to significantly increase our R&D spending and build on our innovations delivering the most cost effective and integrated CDMA-based products." "As a result of our performance and strong cash position, during fiscal 2003 we initiated a $1 billion stock repurchase program, paid our first quarterly dividend, and in the fourth quarter we increased the quarterly dividend. QUALCOMM remains well positioned to grow earnings and revenue with its large technology portfolio and strong balance sheet." Dr. Jacobs said. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $143 million in the fourth fiscal quarter, up 30 percent year-over-year. The increase in R&D expenses compared to the year ago quarter was primarily related to continued new product development efforts. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were relatively flat in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to the year ago quarter, increasing 1 percent to $134 million. Our fiscal 2003 effective income tax rate was approximately 36 percent, compared to 22 percent in fiscal 2002. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the reduction of valuation allowances in fiscal 2002 that were previously charged to tax expense. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 6%
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 3 of 19 mainly as a result of tax losses relating to Brazilian investments and operations. Excluding the QSI segment, our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 33 percent, compared to 35 percent in fiscal 2002. The lower rate was caused by higher foreign earnings which are subject to a lower tax rate. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. Vesper losses before taxes were $28 million in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $42 million in the year ago quarter. The remainder of the net loss before taxes in QSI was $14 million for the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $56 million in the year ago quarter. The net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 included $27 million of other-than-temporary losses on investments and $16 million in equity losses, partially offset by $32 million in net realized gains on investment sales. On September 25, 2003, Embratel Participacoes S.A. (Embratel) entered into an agreement to acquire from us for nominal consideration the Vesper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction) excluding the tower and rooftop antennae assets and related property leases (Tower Sites). Concurrent with the closing, Vesper will enter into a multi-year arrangement whereby it pays a monthly fee to us to use the Tower Sites. The sum of these fees, net of certain pass through expenses, is expected to exceed $77 million over the life of the arrangement. The closing of the Embratel sale transaction is contingent upon a number of events being completed prior to or concurrent with closing, including regulatory approval. Assuming the requisite government approvals are received and all conditions to close are satisfied, we anticipate providing approximately $40 million to $45 million in aggregate funding (including $6 million of interim funding) by the closing date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. We expect to record an approximate $35 million to $45 million loss if and when the transaction closes, including the recognition of cumulative foreign translation losses. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 4 of 19 FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2004 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the first fiscal quarter will increase sequentially by approximately 16-22 percent and decrease year-over-year by approximately 1-6 percent. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.37-$0.40 in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $0.42 in the year ago quarter. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 27-28 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. We expect approximately 106 - 108 million CDMA phones to be sold in calendar 2003. - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the first quarter will increase sequentially by approximately 14-20 percent and decrease year-over-year 1-5 percent. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.25-$0.28 in the first fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.12 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to $0.13 per share in the year ago quarter. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. FISCAL 2004 - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 5-9 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.37-$1.43 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.42 last fiscal year. We anticipate the combination of R&D and SG&A expenses to grow approximately 18-20 percent year-over-year, primarily to serve the expanding market for CDMA2000 and WCDMA chipsets. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 131-136 million units in calendar 2004, and we estimate a decrease of approximately 8 percent in average selling prices of CDMA phones for fiscal 2004, upon which royalties are calculated, compared to an estimated decrease in fiscal 2003 of 2 percent. - Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 3-7 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $1.17-$1.23 for fiscal 2004, up 16-22 percent year-over-
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 5 of 19 year, including an estimated $0.20 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized gains or losses, gains or losses on derivatives, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $5.0 billion on June 29, 2003 and $3.2 billion on September 29, 2002. We have invested $158 million in net stock repurchases and have paid $135 million in cash dividends since the inception of these programs in February 2003. In fiscal 2003, QSI generated net cash of $634 million. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment are included at the end of this news release.

QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 7 of 19 (1) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (2) Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $61.5 million of amortization of goodwill, $3.2 million of amortization of intangible assets, $0.5 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, $0.2 million in cost of revenues related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business, offset by $7.3 million of credits and $0.9 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business In fiscal 2002, goodwill amortization and other adjustments included $245.3 million of amortization of goodwill, $13.3 million of amortization of intangible assets, $5.9 million of payroll expenses on stock option exercises, offset by $7.4 million of selling, general and administrative credits and $0.1 million of revenue related to the sale of the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless infrastructure business and $4.0 million of credits related to the reduction of reserves established in connection with the Globalstar business. With the adoption of FAS 142 in 2003 and given the immateriality of the other adjustments, the Company no longer makes these adjustments to its results excluding QSI in fiscal 2003. (3) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding.

This conference call may contain forward-looking financial information. The conference call will include a discussion of "non-GAAP financial measures" as that term is defined in Regulation G. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as the other material financial and statistical information to be discussed in the conference call, will be posted on the Company's Investor Relations web site at www.qualcomm.com immediately prior to commencement of the call. A taped audio replay will
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 11 of 19 be available via telephone on November 5, 2003 beginning at approximately 4:30 p.m. (PST) through November 10, 2003 at 4:30 p.m. (PST). To listen to the replay, U.S. callers may dial (800) 633-8284 and international callers may dial (402) 977-9140. U.S. and international callers should use reservation number 21153026. An audio replay of the conference call will be available on the Company's web site at www.qualcomm.com for two weeks following the live call. QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2003 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM. NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The Company presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable debt securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results Page 12 of 19 management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI and between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented herein. NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: changing global economic conditions, particularly in the telecommunications and Internet-related industries and the resulting uncertainty in forecasting future results; timing and receipt of license fees and royalties; integrated circuit inventory and order levels; the Company's ability to execute additional 3G licenses; the scale-up, acceptance and operations of CDMA systems, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and systems in new markets such as China and India; the ability to sustain or improve operational efficiency and profitability; decreases in the rate of growth in CDMA-based wireless data and Internet access or the CDMA subscriber population; strategic investments, loans, acquisitions or divestitures the Company has or may pursue; the successful close of the Embratel sale transaction; changes in the fair values of marketable securities and derivative instruments held; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of evolving CDMA technology standards; developments in current or future litigation; customer receivables and performance guarantees; component shortages; and international business activities, as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports. ### QUALCOMM(R), QCT(R) QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions(R), OmniTRACS(R), GlobalTRACS(R), MSM(TM), CSM(TM), CSM6800(TM), MSM6025(TM), MSM6150(TM), MSM6250(TM), MSM6500(TM), MSM6550(TM), MSM6800(TM), Launchpad(TM) and BREW(TM) are trademarks and/or service marks of QUALCOMM Incorporated.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
     On December 2, 2003 (the "Closing Date"), Vsper Holding, Ltd ("VHL"), a majority-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company"), and QUALCOMM do Brasil Ltda. ("QdB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, conveyed all of their rights, title and interest in and to the shares of capital stock of Vsper Holding S.A. and Vsper Holding So Paulo S.A. (collectively, the "Brazilian Holding Companies"), constituting all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Brazilian Holding Companies, to Embratel Particpaes S.A. ("Embratel"), pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") dated as of September 25, 2003 among VHL, QdB and Embratel. In addition to indirectly acquiring the shares of Vsper S.A. and Vsper So Paulo S.A. (the "Vsper Operating Companies") held by the Brazilian Holding Companies, under the SPA Embratel also directly acquired on the Closing Date from VHL all of its rights, title and interest in and to all the remaining shares of capital stock of the Vsper Operating Companies. While the SPA provided for the payment by Embratel of nominal consideration in the total amount of approximately $1 U.S. for the shares of the Brazilian Holding Companies and Vsper Operating Companies, the Company and Embratel have separately agreed that no actual payment thereof was to be made, and no consideration for such shares was received. This price was determined by arms-length negotiations.
     Although under the SPA Embratel directly or indirectly acquired 100% of the shares of the Vsper Operating Companies, the Company has effectively retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary ("TowerCo"), ownership and control of the Vsper Operating Companies' 622 existing communication towers and related interests in tower site property leases ("Vsper Towers"). The communication towers had a net book value of approximately $5 million at September 30, 2003. All other assets of the Vsper Operating Companies as of the Closing Date were included in the Embratel sales transaction. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Vsper Operating Companies and TowerCo entered into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the Vsper Operating Companies' option for up to two successive five year terms) whereby the Vsper Operating Companies will pay a monthly fee for use of aerial and ground space on the tower sites. Under this arrangement, the Company preserves the ability, and plans, to sell some or all of its interest in TowerCo and/or the tower sites (with assignment of the associated rights under the usage rights agreement).
     The Company provided approximately $6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to fund operations of the Vsper Operating Companies and additionally provided approximately $39 million in aggregate funding to or for the benefit of the Vsper Operating Companies on or before the Closing Date to facilitate the transaction. Such facilitation included enabling the Vsper Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt (at an agreed discount) and transfer ownership of the Vsper Towers to TowerCo free and clear of any local bank security interest. All other liabilities of the Vsper Operating Companies as of the Closing Date were included in the Embratel sales transaction. The Company expects to realize an estimated loss of $50 million to $60 million on the Embratel sales transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
     On November 19, 2002, QdB won bids to acquire personal mobile service ("SMP") licenses in the state of So Paulo (excluding So Paulo metro), the state of Minas Gerais, and in the Northeast region of Brazil. Approximately $8 million of the approximate $82 million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in December 2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated
Table of Contents
obligation was financed by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment for inflation, payable in six equal annual installments starting in fiscal 2006. These SMP licenses with a net book value of approximately $103 million and a corresponding liability of approximately $111 million at September 30, 2003 were not included in the Embratel sales transaction. The Company has initiated the waiver and return of the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information does not include the accounting for the return of the SMP licenses.
     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued in January 2003. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46 were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003. The Company has determined that the Vsper Operating Companies are variable interest entities; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Vsper Operating Companies. The Vsper Operating Companies will therefore not be consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements after the Closing Date. However, numerous implementation issues and questions exist related to the application of FIN 46 and it is expected that the FASB will issue additional guidance that may clarify or revise FIN 46 as issued. The Company will continue to monitor guidance provided by the FASB to determine the effect, if any, FIN 46 will have on this transaction.
     None of the Company, its affiliates, the Company's directors or officers, or any of its directors' or officers' associates has any material relationship with Embratel.

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 21, 2004 QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2003. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information including marketable securities and excluding the QSI segment. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented in the press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1 QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS REVENUES $1.2 BILLION, EPS $0.43 REVENUES $1.2 BILLION, EPS $0.51 EXCLUDING QSI SEGMENT SAN DIEGO - January 21, 2004 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced its first quarter fiscal 2004 results ended December 28, 2003. Revenues were $1.2 billion in the first fiscal quarter, up 37 percent sequentially and 13 percent year-over-year. First fiscal quarter net income was $352 million and earnings per share were $0.43, up 21 percent and 23 percent sequentially and up 46 percent and 43 percent year-over-year, respectively. Revenues excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment were $1.2 billion in the first fiscal quarter, up 39 percent sequentially and 13 percent year-over-year. First fiscal quarter net income excluding the QSI segment was $419 million and earnings per share were $0.51, up 77 percent and 76 percent, respectively, compared to the prior quarter, and both up 21 percent year-over-year. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. "Our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 have exceeded our expectations by every measure," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "We now anticipate the full 2004 fiscal year to be stronger than we had earlier anticipated due to increased worldwide demand for CDMA phones and devices with increased functionality such as color screens, cameras and multimedia capabilities. We also believe that CDMA channel inventories approached near record low levels in the fourth fiscal quarter, fueling increased demand for our MSMs." "Verizon's recent announcement of their intent to proceed with a nationwide deployment of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO will have a positive effect on broadband wireless data use not only in the United States but around the world. Clearly, demand for wireless data is no longer a phenomenon associated with any single geography. Now with high speed, low latency CDMA-based networks and competitive pricing, data capabilities are fueling the next wave of innovation of value to enterprises as well as individuals. Verizon will soon offer, throughout most of the United States, a wireless broadband - -more-
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 2 of 16 experience with rich content and multimedia capabilities that consumers have been experiencing in South Korea, Brazil and more recently in Japan. BREW will play an ever more important role in exciting consumers with a broad range of attractive applications, supporting enterprises in readily developing vertical applications and enabling developers and carriers to realize new revenue streams. Indeed, combined with 1xEV-DO, the power of BREW for supporting new applications will quickly impact many aspects of our lives and commerce." "In this period of rapid change, QUALCOMM's close integration of technology and system software development, chipset design, application software support, and customer interaction and service provides a unique strategic advantage. QUALCOMM's technology leadership in multiband and multimode devices for worldwide roaming in combination with our history of on-time delivery positions us well for continued success in the 3G CDMA markets." Research and development (R&D) expenses were $150 million in the first fiscal quarter, up 33 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increased R&D investment in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) to continue to drive broadly segmented chipset platforms in response to market demand including WCDMA (UMTS), CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $137 million in the first fiscal quarter, down 8 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to a decrease in SG&A expenses of the Vesper Operating Companies in Brazil, which we sold during the first fiscal quarter. First fiscal quarter revenues grew $333 million sequentially, including a $111 million increase in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) segment revenues and a $247 million increase in QCT segment revenues. QTL revenues were greater than anticipated due primarily to greater CDMA phone shipments by our licensees, at higher than expected average selling prices. In the first quarter fiscal 2004 our licensees reported CDMA phone sales for the fourth quarter fiscal 2003 of approximately 31 million units as compared to the Company's initial expectation of approximately 26 million units. QCT sold approximately 32 million MSM phone chips in the first quarter fiscal 2004, which was greater than our initial expectation of 27-28 million MSM phone chips. The increase in QCT R&D expenses compared to the year ago quarter and the effects of reductions in
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 3 of 16 average sales prices and changes in product mix were the primary reasons that QCT earnings decreased year-over-year. Our fiscal 2004 effective income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 33 percent, including an effective income tax rate for QSI of 3 percent. In fiscal 2003 our effective income tax rate was approximately 36 percent. The effective tax rate in the first quarter fiscal 2004 was approximately 35 percent. The reported and QSI effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 differ from the expected annual effective tax rates due to the tax impact of the sale of the Vesper Operating Companies. Excluding the QSI segment, our fiscal 2004 effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 31 percent, compared to 33 percent in fiscal 2003. The lower estimated annual effective tax rates as compared to the prior fiscal year are largely due to higher foreign earnings which are subject to a lower rate. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. Operating losses of the Vesper Operating Companies were $7 million in the first fiscal quarter compared to $30 million in the year ago quarter. In addition, we recorded a net realized loss of $52 million on the sale of the Vesper Operating Companies to Embratel in December 2003. The remainder of the net loss before taxes in QSI was $9 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $103 million in the year ago quarter. In addition to Vesper, the net loss in the first quarter fiscal 2004 included $16 million in equity losses, partially offset by $14 million in interest income, including $10 million in deferred interest income related to Pegaso's prepayment in full of the principal amount of all outstanding loans owed under an equipment loan facility. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the second fiscal quarter will decrease approximately 6-13 percent sequentially and increase 3-11 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 4 of 16 approximately $0.38-$0.41 in the second fiscal quarter, compared to $0.38 in the year ago quarter. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 29-31 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. We anticipate that operating expenses will increase in the second fiscal quarter compared to the first fiscal quarter due to seasonal factors such as higher employee payroll taxes and public company expenses, as well as continued increases in our R&D workforce. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the second quarter will decrease approximately 9-15 percent sequentially and increase 1-8 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.34-$0.37 in the second fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.04 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to $0.13 per share in the year ago quarter. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2004. We now anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 8-12 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.56-$1.61 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.42 last fiscal year. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 138-146 million units in calendar 2004, and we estimate a decrease of approximately 7 percent in average selling prices of CDMA phones for fiscal 2004, upon which royalties are calculated, compared to an average selling price that held constant in fiscal 2003. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 6-10 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41-$1.46 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.01 last fiscal year, including an estimated $0.15 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 5 of 16 excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5.9 billion at the end of the first quarter fiscal 2004, compared to $5.4 billion on September 28, 2003 and $3.9 billion on December 29, 2002. We paid $56 million in cash dividends in the first quarter fiscal 2004. In the first quarter fiscal 2004, net cash transfers from QSI were $113 million. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are included at the end of this news release.

     On April 21, 2004 QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2004. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.

Exhibit 99.1 QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail: ir@qualcomm.com QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS REVENUES $1.2 BILLION, EPS $0.58 REVENUES $1.2 BILLION, EPS $0.53 EXCLUDING QSI SEGMENT SAN DIEGO - April 21, 2004 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced its second quarter fiscal 2004 results ended March 28, 2004. Revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, up one percent sequentially and 20 percent year-over-year. The second quarter fiscal 2004 net income was $488 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58, up 39 percent and 35 percent sequentially and 374 percent and 346 percent year-over-year, respectively. The second quarter fiscal 2004 net income excluding the QSI segment was $442 million, up six percent sequentially and 41 percent year-over-year. The second quarter fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment were $0.53, up four percent sequentially and 39 percent year-over-year. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. In this quarter we disposed of all remaining operations and assets related to the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," their results of operations and cash flows are presented as discontinued operations within the QSI segment. Our statements of operations and cash flows for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this and are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. "Our financial results reflect the strong acceptance and rapid global growth of 3G CDMA," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "Consumers and enterprises increasingly recognize the benefits of CDMA-based networks, with the number of subscribers now exceeding 200 million. Early 3G CDMA entrants continue to perform well. KDDI, the first CDMA operator -more-
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 2 of 19 in Japan, announced its sixth consecutive month as the leading Japanese operator in net subscriber additions, and now has approximately 14 million subscribers on its 3G network. Better coverage and new handsets have accelerated WCDMA (UMTS) uptake and resulted in over 4 million cumulative subscribers in Japan and Europe at the end of the quarter. NTT DoCoMo, the largest Japanese operator, added approximately 724,000 subscribers to its 3G FOMA network in March 2004, for a total of over three million WCDMA subscribers. In South Korea, local number portability and compelling 1xEV-DO handsets contributed to the highest monthly net additions in two years and a 1xEV-DO base that now exceeds 6.4 million subscribers. The United States CDMA market continues to grow, benefiting from local number portability and the popularity of camera phones and color screens. Finally, we experienced continued growth in China and India and strong growth in Brazil, propelled by low-priced MSM6000-based entry level phones." "This quarter, we matched the prior quarter's record high by shipping approximately 32 million MSM phone chips; however, worldwide demand for our chipsets exceeded our supply, particularly the MSM5100 and MSM5500. We anticipate supply to better align with demand over the course of the next two quarters. "Research and development continued at high levels. Both the CDMA2000 1X Revision D and the 1xEV-DO Revision A standards were completed, each supporting peak data rates of 3.1 Mbps on the forward link and 1.8 Mbps on the reverse link. We publicly demonstrated CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Gold Multicast, allowing multimedia content to be sent simultaneously to many users; MediaFLO, an end-to-end product and service delivering multiple channels of video conveniently accessed by an on-screen channel guide; and Quality-of-Service features supporting greatly enhanced performance for Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VOIP), push-to-chat, and video telephony. We believe these and other projects will drive further expansion of 3G CDMA, subscriber migration from 2G systems, and higher revenues. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 grew $199 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2003, including a $130 million increase in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) segment revenues and a $65 million increase in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment revenues. QTL revenues increased over the prior year due primarily to greater phone and infrastructure equipment sales by our licensees. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, our licensees
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 3 of 19 reported CDMA phone sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 of approximately 37 million units, compared to 27 million units in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. QCT sold approximately 32 million Mobile Station Modem(TM) (MSM(TM)) phone chips in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 28 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $169 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, up 28 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to increases in costs related to integrated circuit products and corporate initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM1x and WCDMA (UMTS). Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $138 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, up 14 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses for an expanding customer base. Our annual effective income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 30 percent for fiscal 2004, for both total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI. In the first fiscal quarter our estimated effective tax rates were 32 percent and 31 percent for total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI, respectively. Due to the change in the estimated rate for fiscal 2004, in the second fiscal quarter our tax rates were 28 percent for total QUALCOMM and 29 percent for QUALCOMM excluding QSI. In fiscal 2003, our actual effective income tax rate was approximately 34 percent and 33 percent, for total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI, respectively. The lower estimated annual effective tax rate as compared to our prior estimate for fiscal 2004 and the prior fiscal year is largely due to expected higher foreign earnings which are subject to a lower rate. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we sold the Vesper Operating Companies to Embratel, realizing a net loss of $52 million on the sale. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, TowerCo, which owned and operated the Vesper communications towers, to Embratel, realizing a net gain of $40 million on the sale. Also in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil, approved
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 4 of 19 the return of personal mobile service (SMP) licenses. The related SMP debt was extinguished, resulting in a net gain of $19 million. As a result of the disposition of all remaining operations and assets related to the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, their results of operations and cash flows are presented as discontinued operations within the QSI segment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, QSI's results consist primarily of $21 million in equity losses, partially offset by $4 million in other income resulting from the transfer of a portion of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher to a wireless operator. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the third fiscal quarter will increase approximately 4-7 percent sequentially and 41-44 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.48-$0.50 in the third fiscal quarter, compared to $0.33 in the year ago quarter. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 33-35 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the third quarter will increase approximately 4-7 percent sequentially and 41-44 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.46-$0.48 in the third fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.02 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to $0.09 per share in the year ago quarter. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 5 of 19 FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2004. We now anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 26-29 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.93-$1.98 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.42 last fiscal year. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 152-160 million units in calendar 2004, and we estimate average selling prices of CDMA phones for fiscal 2004, upon which royalties are calculated, to remain constant year-over-year. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 26-29 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $1.86-$1.91 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.01 last fiscal year, including an estimated $0.07 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment for fiscal 2004. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and both current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled approximately $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $5.9 billion on December 28, 2003, and $4.4 billion on March 30, 2003. We paid $57 million in cash dividends, $0.07 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. On March 2, 2004, we announced a 43 percent increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share payable on June 25, 2004 to stockholders of record on May 28, 2004. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, net cash transfers from QSI were $39 million. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are included in this news release.
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 6 of 19 RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following tables, which present segment information, have been adjusted to reflect the SnapTrack reorganization (Note 1) and discontinued operations (Note 3) (dollars in thousands, except per share data): SECOND QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 FIRST QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 SECOND QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2003 SIX MONTHS - FISCAL YEAR 2004 SIX MONTHS - FISCAL YEAR 2003
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 7 of 19 - ---------- (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position location technology. The Company previously presented all of the revenues and operating results of SnapTrack in the QCT segment. As a result of the reorganization of SnapTrack, revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's server software business (software for location-based services and applications) became part of the QIS division in the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's client business (the gpsOne technology that is embedded with the integrated circuit products) remain with the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. (2) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (3) During fiscal 2004, the Company sold its consolidated subsidiaries, the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, and returned personal mobile service (SMP) licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. The results of operations of the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, including gains and losses realized on the sales transactions and the SMP licenses, are presented as discontinued operations. The Company's statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. (4) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding. * As adjusted.

QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 10 of 19 CONFERENCE CALL QUALCOMM's second quarter fiscal 2004 earnings conference call will be broadcast live on April 21, 2004 beginning at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on the Company's web site at: www.qualcomm.com. This conference call may contain forward-looking financial information. The conference call will include a discussion of "non-GAAP financial measures" as that term is defined in Regulation G. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as the other material financial and statistical information to be discussed in the conference call, will be posted on the Company's Investor Relations web site at www.qualcomm.com immediately prior to commencement of the call. A taped audio replay will be available via telephone on April 21, 2004 beginning at approximately 4:30 p.m. (PDT) through April 26, 2004 at 4:30 p.m. (PDT). To listen to the replay, U.S. callers may dial (800) 633-8284 and international callers may dial (402) 977-9140. U.S. and international callers should use reservation number 21187953. An audio replay of the conference call will be available on the Company's web site at www.qualcomm.com for two weeks following the live call. QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2003 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM. NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 11 of 19 The Company presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI and between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented herein. NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA based networks and CDMA based technology, including CDMA2000 1X and WCDMA (UMTS), both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the we have or may pursue; dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; developments in current and future litigation as well as other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports. ###

     On July 21, 2004 QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2004. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows.

Revenues were $1.3 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, up 50 percent year-over-year and 10 percent sequentially. The third quarter fiscal 2004 net income was $486 million, up 154 percent year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. The third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.58, up 152 percent year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. The third quarter fiscal 2004 net income excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment was $483 million, up 81 percent year-over-year and nine percent sequentially. The third quarter fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment were $0.57, up 73 percent year-over-year and eight percent sequentially. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. "The CDMA market continues to exhibit impressive growth as more subscribers are enjoying the benefits of third generation CDMA networks throughout the world," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "Record demand for our chipsets and stronger than expected WCDMA sales are driving higher revenues and earnings. Twenty-one device manufacturers have selected QUALCOMM's chipsets and system software for their WCDMA deployments. This is the largest customer base in the industry to work with a single WCDMA wireless chipset provider. This quarter, WCDMA royalties accounted for 25 percent of total third party royalties. Based on new and expanding networks and attractive subscriber equipment entering the market, and with increasing competition among 3G operators, we expect WCDMA revenue to constitute a growing portion of our financial results." -more-
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 2 of 20 "3G CDMA continues its rapid expansion around the world, with over 117 million subscribers now utilizing this 3G service following a rapid transition from 2G. In South Korea, over 7 million subscribers have further upgraded to 1xEV-DO, demonstrating a large consumer market for broadband wireless data, especially multimedia downloads and advanced games. In the U. S., with first Verizon Wireless and more recently Sprint PCS deploying 1xEV-DO, and now AT&T Wireless launching WCDMA in four markets, we will soon have three nationwide operators as well as a number of regional operators offering third generation wireless services to the enterprise and consumer markets. The experience first gained with CDMA2000 advanced services and devices will benefit all 3G operators, ensuring the availability of attractive applications and devices and supporting evaluation of different marketing strategies. QUALCOMM continues to work closely with all 3G operators to support the successful rollout of CDMA worldwide. We continue a heavy investment in research and development to ensure the availability of the services and devices requested by operators, to reduce their costs, and to further increase the support provided by BREW." Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 grew $449 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003, including a $236 million increase in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment revenues and a $194 million increase in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) segment revenues. QCT sold approximately 35 million Mobile Station Modem(TM) (MSM(TM)) phone chips in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 23 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. QTL revenues increased over the prior year due primarily to greater phone sales at higher average selling prices by our licensees. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, our licensees reported CDMA phone sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 of approximately 38 million units, compared to 26 million units reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $194 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, up 43 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to increases in costs related to integrated circuit products and corporate initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM1x and WCDMA (UMTS).
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 3 of 20 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $162 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, up 40 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses, a charitable grant to an educational institution for the primary purpose of furthering the study of engineering and math, and legal fees. Our fiscal 2004 annual effective income tax rates from continuing operations are estimated to be approximately 29 percent and 30 percent for total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI, respectively. The QUALCOMM rate is lower than the QUALCOMM rate excluding QSI because of capitial losses tax effected in QSI. In the second quarter fiscal 2004 our annual effective income tax rate from continuing operations was estimated to be approximately 30 percent for both total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI. In the third quarter fiscal 2004 our tax rates from continuing operations were 27 percent for total QUALCOMM and 28 percent for QUALCOMM excluding QSI. The 27 percent third quarter fiscal 2004 tax rate from continuing operations was reduced by approximately $26 million related to the filing of our 2003 federal tax return in June 2004, partially offset by a $14 million adjustment to our forecast of our ability to utilize capital losses. In fiscal 2003, our actual effective income tax rates from continuing operations were approximately 34 percent and 33 percent, for total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM excluding QSI, respectively. The lower estimated annual effective tax rates as compared to the prior fiscal year are largely due to higher foreign earnings expected in fiscal 2004 which are subject to a lower rate. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. Our QSI operator investment activities continue to decrease as planned. With the sale of TowerCo in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we no longer have any investment interest in the Vesper Operating Companies in Brazil. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, QSI's results consisted primarily of $18 million in equity losses, most of which related to our investment in Inquam, partially offset by $11 million in realized investment gains and investment income, and $5 million in other income resulting primarily from the transfer of a portion of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher to a wireless operator. STOCK SPLIT
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 4 of 20 On July 13, 2004, QUALCOMM's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company's Common Stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The non-taxable stock dividend will be distributed on August 13, 2004 to stockholders of record on July 23, 2004. Per share numbers presented herein are on a pre-stock split basis. QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND On July 13, 2004, we announced a 40 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.14 per share of common stock. The new dividend rate will be effective for the quarterly dividend payable on September 24, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 27, 2004. This dividend will increase the annual dividend rate to $0.56 per share of common stock. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses, income related to the use of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the fourth fiscal quarter will increase 57-65 percent year-over-year and increase approximately 2-7 percent sequentially. We anticipate that earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.54-$0.57 in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to $0.29 in the year ago quarter. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 36-38 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter will increase approximately 57-65 percent year-over-year and 2-7 percent sequentially. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately $0.53-
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 5 of 20 $0.56 in the fourth fiscal quarter, including an estimated $0.01 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to a $0.07 gain per share in the year ago quarter. FISCAL 2004 Based on the current business outlook, we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2004. We now anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will grow by approximately 33-35 percent year-over-year and earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $2.15-$2.18 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.42 last fiscal year. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be 161-168 million units in calendar 2004, and we estimate average selling prices of CDMA phones for fiscal 2004, upon which royalties are calculated, to increase to approximately $209, compared to our prior estimate of $195. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will grow by approximately 33-35 percent year-over-year and total QUALCOMM earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12-$2.15 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.01 last fiscal year, including an estimated $0.03 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment for fiscal 2004. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and both current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled approximately $7.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $5.4 billion on September 28, 2003, and $5.0 billion on June 29, 2003. We paid $81 million in cash dividends, or $0.10 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, cash transfers from QSI were offset by cash transfers to QSI, resulting in net cash transfers from QSI of zero. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are included in this news release.
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 6 of 20 RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following tables, which present segment information, have been adjusted to reflect the SnapTrack reorganization (Note 1) and discontinued operations (Note 3) (dollars in thousands, except per share data): THIRD QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 SECOND QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 THIRD QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2003 NINE MONTHS - FISCAL YEAR 2004 NINE MONTHS - FISCAL YEAR 2003
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 7 of 20 (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position location technology. The Company previously presented all of the revenues and operating results of SnapTrack in the QCT segment. As a result of the reorganization of SnapTrack, revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's server software business (software for location-based services and applications) became part of the QIS division in the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's client business (the gpsOne(TM) technology that is embedded within the integrated circuit products) remain with the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. (2) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (3) During fiscal 2004, the Company sold its consolidated subsidiaries, the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, and returned personal mobile service (SMP) licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. The results of operations of the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, including gains and losses realized on the sales transactions and the SMP licenses, are presented as discontinued operations. The Company's statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. (4) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding. * As adjusted as described in the notes above.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2003 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM. NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 11 of 20 strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The Company presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI and between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented herein. NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA based networks and CDMA based technology, including CDMA2000 1X and WCDMA (UMTS), both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees;
QUALCOMM Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results Page 12 of 20 fluctuations in the demand for CDMA based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the we have or may pursue; dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; developments in current and future litigation as well as other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports. ### QUALCOMM(R), Mobile Station Modem(TM), MSM(TM), gpsOne(TM), CSM(TM), MSM6150(TM), MSM6550(TM), MSM6280(TM), MSM7200(TM), MSM7500(TM), MSM7600(TM), CMix(TM), Compact Media Extensions(TM), radioOne(TM), RFR6135(TM), RFR6122(TM), RFT6122(TM), RFR6155(TM), RFT6150(TM), RFR6275(TM), BREW(R), BREWChat(R), QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions(R), OmniTRACS(R), QTRACS(R) and EutelTRACS(TM) are trademarks and/or service marks of QUALCOMM Incorporated.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On November 3, 2004 QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 26, 2004. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail: ir@qualcomm.com QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2004 RESULTS GAAP FY2004 REVENUES $4.9 BILLION, EPS $1.03 PRO FORMA REVENUES $5.1 BILLION, EPS $1.09 EXCLUDING QSI SEGMENT SAN DIEGO - November 3, 2004 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 year ended September 26, 2004. INTRODUCTION All of the share and per share amounts in this release reflect the two-for-one stock split that was effected in the form of a stock dividend on August 13, 2004 to QUALCOMM stockholders of record on July 23, 2004. Results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reflect the Company's decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to cease accruing estimated earned royalties before the actual amounts were reported by our licensees, as announced on October 28, 2004. Results that assume the accrual of estimated earned royalties before they are reported by our licensees (the "Prior Method of Estimating Royalties") are presented as supplemental information to assist investors with evaluating financial performance during this transition period. RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES Background For financial reporting purposes, the change resulting from the new royalty estimation method is made prospectively and has the one-time effect of significantly reducing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Therefore, GAAP results for fiscal 2004 do not reflect a full year of the economic performance of the Company's licensing business, as significant royalty revenue that would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 will now be recognized in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 when the actual royalty reports are received from licensees. -more-
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results GAAP Fiscal 2004 Revenues were $4.9 billion in fiscal 2004, up 27 percent compared to fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 earnings were $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.03, up 108 percent and 102 percent, respectively, compared to fiscal 2003. GAAP Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2004 Revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up 28 percent year-over-year and down 17 percent sequentially. Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 grew $247 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, including a $343 million increase in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment revenues and a $91 million decrease in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) segment revenues, including the effect of the change in method of accruing estimated earned royalties in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 partially offset by increases in royalties reported by our licensees. The fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.23, up 28 percent year-over-year and down 21 percent sequentially. The decrease in sequential revenue and diluted earnings per share is primarily attributable to the change in the Company's method of accruing estimated earned royalty revenues. These results include diluted earnings per share for the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment in fiscal 2004 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 of $0.02 and $0.03, respectively. GAAP Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2004 Operating Costs Research and development (R&D) expenses were $208 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up 45 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to increases in costs related to integrated circuit products and initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products including CDMA2000(R) 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $146 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up 24 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, largely attributable to employee growth.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results GAAP Effective Tax Rates Our GAAP fiscal 2004 effective tax rate for total QUALCOMM was approximately 25 percent compared to approximately 34 percent in fiscal 2003. The 2004 tax rate is lower than the 2003 tax rate largely due to higher foreign earnings in fiscal 2004 which are taxed at a lower rate, tax benefits resulting from the Company's forecast of its ability to use additional capital loss carryforwards, and the reduction, as a percentage of total earnings, of QTL pretax earnings which are taxed at a rate that is higher than our effective tax rate. The 10 percent fourth quarter fiscal 2004 tax rate from continuing operations for total QUALCOMM is lower than the annual effective tax rate due to the reduction in earnings taxed at a higher rate that resulted from the change in method of estimating QTL royalties as well as an increase in our forecast of our ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards. RESULTS UTILIZING THE PRIOR METHOD OF ESTIMATING ROYALTIES EXCLUDING THE QSI SEGMENT ("PRO FORMA" RESULTS) Background The following results exclude the QSI segment and use the Prior Method of Estimating Royalties for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2004. Results on this basis will only be given for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2004 and are provided to enable comparisons to our prior year results and our previous guidance published on September 17, 2004. For ease of reference, results utilizing the Prior Method and excluding QSI are referred to as "pro forma." Pro forma revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 include an estimate of $251 million in royalties that would have been recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 had we not made this change. This Prior Method, while no longer in accordance with GAAP, was determined to be consistent with our past practices. A summary of our September 17, 2004 guidance and a detailed reconciliation between total QUALCOMM GAAP results and the pro forma results is included herein and is presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. Pro Forma Fiscal 2004 Pro forma revenues were $5.1 billion in fiscal 2004, up 33 percent year-over-year, compared to our prior guidance of a 33-34 percent year-over-year increase. Pro forma diluted earnings per share were $1.09 in fiscal 2004, as compared to our prior guidance of $1.09-$1.10.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results Pro Forma Fiscal Fourth Quarter Pro forma revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up 57 percent year-over-year, as compared to our prior guidance of 60-62 percent. Pro forma diluted earnings per share were $0.29 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as compared to our prior guidance of $0.28-$0.30. Pro Forma Effective Tax Rate Our fiscal 2004 effective pro forma tax rate was approximately 29 percent compared to approximately 33 percent in fiscal 2003. The pro forma 2004 tax rate is lower than the 2003 tax rate largely due to higher foreign earnings in fiscal 2004 which are taxed at a lower rate. The annual effective tax rate declined from the approximately 30 percent forecast in the third quarter to a pro forma annual effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent resulting in a fourth fiscal quarter pro forma tax rate of approximately 26 percent. Fiscal 2004 Review and Commentary MSM and Phone Shipments: QCT sold approximately 39 million Mobile Station Modem(TM) (MSM(TM)) phone chips in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, our licensees reported CDMA phone sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of approximately 41 million units at an average selling price of $211, compared to 23 million units reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at an average selling price of $193. For most of this year, there has been insufficient channel inventory of our MSMs and CDMA phones as demand continued to increase throughout the fiscal year. The Company now believes that the CDMA channel has come back into better balance, due in part to the recent temporary slowdown of the South Korean market. As a result, unit shipments in the fourth fiscal quarter were lower than our estimate of 46 million units. The Company now anticipates that 48-50 million CDMA phones will be shipped in the December quarter. "The CDMA market experienced dramatic growth during QUALCOMM's fiscal year 2004," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "We met our earnings per share and revenue targets on a pro forma basis delivering year-over-year growth of 54% and 33%, respectively. The continuing growth in the worldwide adoption of CDMA technology has significantly increased the cash flow and earnings of QUALCOMM and we are pleased to share this success with our
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results stockholders through our dividend program. The performance of our business is once again a direct result of the dedication of the employees at QUALCOMM, their commitment to excellence and the effective partnerships we have achieved with our customers, both manufacturers and operators." "Clearly, the desire on the part of consumers and enterprises to utilize applications that require more efficient and faster data transmission is driving the deployment of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and operator requests for earlier availability of High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) for WCDMA. To support the growing worldwide demand for multimedia services, we announced an evolution of our 1xEV-DO technology called "Platinum Multicast" and a new air interface innovation called FLO(TM) (Forward Link Only). Both are designed to increase network capacity and reduce the costs associated with delivering high-quality video and audio to mobile handsets. On November 1, 2004, we announced plans to deploy and operate a nationwide mobile wireless multimedia network in the U.S. through a new subsidiary, MediaFLO USA Inc. This new subsidiary will provide a comprehensive wireless multimedia service by delivering a wide selection of program choices and very high-quality video and audio to U.S. consumers' mobile phones at mass market prices. Although the exact timing has not yet been decided, the Company intends a spin-off of our interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders." "QUALCOMM's performance this year was positively impacted by the continued deployments of WCDMA networks around the world. Growth and demand for WCDMA networks and services have strengthened recently with the availability of more feature rich devices, attractive applications, and continually improving coverage. Our strategy of integration and the ability to share powerful software features among all of our chipsets has proven to be a competitive advantage in the burgeoning WCDMA market. We remain focused on providing our customers a strong competitive advantage in performance and cost over other solutions in the market. Our leadership position in chipset development is enabling us to rapidly address the emerging demand for HSDPA and capitalize on the high data rate opportunities in the WCDMA market." "Due to the execution and continued confidence in our business plan, the QUALCOMM Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend twice during fiscal 2004 bringing the annual dividend to $0.28 per share of common stock after our recent two-for-one stock split. With a strong free cash flow, QUALCOMM is positioned for further increases to its dividend program. In fiscal 2005, we
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results plan to continue investing in areas that will further our technological leadership and drive another strong growth year for 3G CDMA." QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. The fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results consisted primarily of $44 million in net gains on investments and $6 million in other income primarily from the transfer of the remaining portion of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher to a wireless operator, partially offset by $17 million in equity losses and $11 million in other-than-temporary losses on investments. Our total QUALCOMM GAAP results include diluted earnings per share for the QSI segment in fiscal 2004 and the fourth fiscal quarter of $0.02 and $0.03, respectively. QSI net cash generated for fiscal 2004 was $169 million. Cash and Marketable Securities QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and both current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled approximately $7.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $5.4 billion on September 28, 2003. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations was $770 million compared to $462 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. We paid $114 million in cash dividends, or $0.07 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Detailed reconciliations between changes in total QUALCOMM GAAP cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and total QUALCOMM excluding the QSI segment are included in this news release. BUSINESS OUTLOOK Background - QSI Segment Includes MediaFLO Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the results of our newly announced MediaFLO(TM) U.S. operator business will be included as part of the QSI segment. Including the MediaFLO U.S. operator business in the QSI segment is consistent with our historical treatment of strategic investments in operators, and our intent to ultimately divest the business by spin-off of our interest to stockholders. Previously, the results of the MediaFLO U.S. operator business were presented as a non-reportable segment included in reconciling items. Business outlook information presented below includes the expected results of the MediaFLO U.S. operator in the QSI segment.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results Outlook and Comparable Period Information Will Be Presented Utilizing New Method ("New Method") of Estimating Royalties Our business outlook and future results will be provided in accordance with the New Method of estimating royalties based solely on reports received from licensees. Because fiscal 2004 QUALCOMM GAAP results are based on the Prior Method and reflect only partial economic performance of the Company's licensing business in the fourth quarter, we will compare the fiscal 2005 outlook (excluding QSI) to the fiscal 2004 results as if the New Method had been in effect for the entire 2004 fiscal year. The historical financial information for fiscal years 2003 through 2004 using the New Method is presented herein to assist investors with evaluating financial performance on a comparable basis. For fiscal 2001 through 2004 this information is presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. Forward-Looking Statements The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such forecasted items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. Fiscal 2005 Outlook Unit Shipments: Based on the current business outlook, we estimate the CDMA phone market will total approximately 218-228 million new unit shipments in calendar 2005. Based on the 223 million unit midpoint of this estimate, we anticipate shipments of approximately 168 million CDMA2000 units and approximately 55 million WCDMA units. We anticipate average selling prices for CDMA phones, CDMA2000 and WCDMA combined, to increase 5 percent in fiscal 2005 to approximately $215, compared to approximately $205 in fiscal 2004. Fiscal year average selling prices will be calculated from phone shipments from the September to the June quarters, consistent with our New Method for royalty accounting.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results Fiscal 2005 Outlook Excluding QSI Based on the current business outlook we anticipate fiscal 2005 revenues excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of approximately $5.8-$6.3 billion, an increase of 16-26 percent, and diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $1.15-$1.19, an increase of 8-12 percent for fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004 results excluding QSI of $1.06 utilizing the New Method. Fiscal 2005 earnings per share include a decrease of approximately $0.02 cents per share due to our three recently announced acquisitions. Under their existing agreements with QUALCOMM, two entities are entitled to share in a percentage of the royalty revenues for certain CDMA products received by QUALCOMM from certain third parties. One of these sharing arrangements expires in latter fiscal 2005 and the other in fiscal 2006. As a result, we have estimated a modest improvement to fiscal 2005 revenue and earnings. In fiscal 2006 we expect the termination of royalty sharing arrangements to contribute approximately $330 to $360 million to our fiscal 2006 revenue and pretax earnings. To enable and support the growth of our business, we anticipate a significant increase in operating expenses. We also expect a higher tax rate for fiscal 2005 of approximately 30 percent which will reduce earnings per share. GAAP Fiscal 2005 Outlook Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM GAAP revenues will be in the range of approximately $5.8-$6.3 billion, an increase of 18-29 percent and total QUALCOMM GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.12-$1.16 for fiscal 2005, an increase of 11-16 percent, including an estimated $0.03 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. Q1 Fiscal 2005 Outlook Unit Shipments: Based on the current business outlook, we estimate the CDMA phone market will be approximately 41 million new unit shipments in the September quarter and approximately 48-52 million for the December quarter. Royalty revenue for the December quarter will be based on the September quarter shipments reported to us on royalty reports received from our licensees in the December quarter. We estimate an average selling price of $213 for the September quarter shipments of 41 million units.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results Q1 Fiscal 2005 Outlook Excluding QSI Based on the current business outlook we estimate first quarter fiscal 2005 revenues excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of approximately $1.3-$1.4 billion, an increase of 12-23 percent year-over-year and relatively flat sequentially, in both cases assuming application of the New Method in the prior periods. Under the New Method, royalty revenues in the first fiscal quarter will reflect CDMA phone shipments that occurred in the quarter ended September 26, 2004. We estimate diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment to be in the range of $0.24-$0.26, a decrease of 10-17 percent sequentially and an increase of 4-13 percent year-over-year (again, assuming the utilization of the New Method in the comparable periods). This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 38-39 million MSM phone chips during the quarter, an increased tax rate and inclusion of the three recently announced acquisitions. GAAP Q1 Fiscal 2005 Outlook Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM GAAP revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 will be in the range of approximately $1.3-$1.4 billion, an increase of 7-18 percent year-over-year and 15-26 percent sequentially. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM GAAP diluted earnings per share will be approximately $0.23-$0.25 in the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 0-9 percent sequentially and 10-19 percent year-over-year, including an estimated $0.01 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment, compared to a $0.04 loss per share in the year ago quarter.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following tables, which present segment information, have been adjusted to reflect the SnapTrack reorganization (Note 1) and discontinued operations (Note 3) (dollars in millions, except per share data): Fourth Quarter - Fiscal Year 2004 Third Quarter - Fiscal Year 2004 Fourth Quarter - Fiscal Year 2003 Twelve Months - Fiscal Year 2004 Twelve Months - Fiscal Year 2003
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position location technology. The Company previously presented all of the revenues and operating results of SnapTrack in the QCT segment. As a result of the reorganization of SnapTrack, revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's server software business (software for location-based services and applications) became part of the QIS division in the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's client business (the gpsOne technology that is embedded within the integrated circuit products) remain with the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. (2) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (3) During fiscal 2004, the Company sold its consolidated subsidiaries, the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, and returned personal mobile service (SMP) licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. The results of operations of the Vesper Operating Companies and TowerCo, including gains and losses realized on the sales transactions and the SMP licenses, are presented as discontinued operations. The Company's statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. (4) The sum of the earnings per share amounts may not equal total earnings per share due to rounding. (5) We affected a two-for-one stock split in August 2004. All references to number of shares and per share amounts reflect the stock split. (6) QTL's results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflect the Company's decision to cease accruing royalties that had been earned but were estimated by us before the actual amounts were reported by our licensees. The new royalty estimation method is made prospectively and has the one-time effect of significantly reducing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Therefore, GAAP results for fiscal 2004 do not reflect a full year of the economic performance of the Company's licensing business, as significant royalty revenue that would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 will now be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 when the actual royalty reports are received from licensees. (7) Pro forma results assume the accrual of estimated earned royalties before they are reported by our licensees and are presented to assist investors with evaluation financial performance during this transition period. (8) Revenues using the New Method are presented to illustrate the differences between the previous estimation method used for royalties prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the new "As Reported by Licensees" method implementing starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. * As adjusted as described in the notes above. N/M - Not Meaningful BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS QUALCOMM CDMA TECHNOLOGIES (QCT) - Shipped approximately 39 million MSM phone chips to customers worldwide during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 20 million units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and approximately 35 million units in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
QUALCOMM Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results The Company presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company presents financial information using the Previous Method for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2004 and financial results as though the New Method had been in effect for prior periods to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's previous guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance as compared to guidance on a consistent and comparable basis. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results using the Previous and New Methods and between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and total QUALCOMM excluding the QSI segment are presented herein.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     In compliance with a Securities and Exchange Commission Frequently Asked Questions Bulletin on Form 8-K issued November 23, 2004, the Company is disclosing the following items which the Securities and Exchange Commission may deem to be material definitive agreement.
     On November 22, 2004, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"), the Committee approved the terms of the 2005 Annual Bonus Program which is applicable to key employees of the Company, including the executive officers. The design of the Company's 2005 Annual Bonus Program (the "Bonus Program") is substantially similar to the Company's 2004 and other prior year programs, and all such programs reward achievement at specified levels of financial and individual performance.
     Under the Bonus Program, just as the Company had done under the 2004 predecessor program, each officer position has an assigned target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year end annual salary. The target bonus levels are competitive with target bonuses for similar positions reported in independent, third-party published surveys used by the Committee. Depending on corporate and business unit financial performance and individual performance, each officer may earn between 0 and 2.5x of the target bonus. Two components comprise the fundamental design of each Bonus Program:
     The Committee's approval of the terms of the Bonus Program shall not be deemed to create an enforceable agreement between the Company and any employee or executive officer, and the Committee retains discretion to reduce or refuse to authorize any awards under the Bonus Program despite attainment of any specific objectives. No rights to any awards shall be deemed to exist unless and until the Committee or, with respect to non-executive officers, the Company, authorizes payment of any awards under the Bonus Program following the completion of any fiscal year measurement periods.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 SUMMARY OF 2005 ANNUAL BONUS PROGRAM The 2005 Annual Bonus Program (the "Bonus Program") of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") rewards achievement at specified levels of financial and individual performance. Under the terms of the Bonus Program, each officer position has an assigned target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year end annual salary. The target bonus levels are competitive with target bonuses for similar positions reported in independent, third-party published surveys used by the Company's Compensation Committee. Depending on corporate and business unit financial performance and individual performance, each officer may earn between 0 and 2.5x of the target bonus. Two components comprise the fundamental design of the Bonus Program: - Financial Performance of the Company or the Company and relevant business unit, as appropriate. Financial performance includes both revenue and Earnings Before Tax (EBT), with greater emphasis placed on EBT. The level of performance, upon which the bonus award is based, is determined from the ratio of fiscal year-end revenue and EBT compared to the planned revenue and EBT budgets reviewed by the Board of Directors at the beginning of the fiscal year. - Individual & Organizational Performance. This discretionary component enables the Committee, and the CEO for executive officers other than the CEO, to award a portion of the annual bonus based on each officer's performance and contribution to the Company during the fiscal year. The Committee's approval of the terms of the Bonus Program shall not be deemed to create an enforceable agreement between the Company and any employee or executive officer, and the Committee retains discretion to reduce or refuse to authorize any awards under the Bonus Program despite attainment of any specific objectives. No rights to any awards shall be deemed to exist unless and until the Committee or, with respect to non-executive officers, the Company, authorizes payment of any awards under the Bonus Program following the completion of any fiscal year measurement periods.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 19, 2005, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2004. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The financial information excluding QSI should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI are presented in the press release.
     The attached press release also presents 2004 financial information excluding QSI as though the New Method of recording royalties, based solely on reports from licensees, had been in effect for the entire year to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM results excluding QSI prepared under the New Method of recording royalties (for each quarter in 2004 and in total) are presented in the press release. The 2004 financial information excluding QSI and under the New Method of recording royalties presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
     The attached press release also presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding the QSI segment are presented in the press release.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail: ir@qualcomm.com QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS REVENUES $1.4 BILLION, EPS $0.30 REVENUES $1.4 BILLION, EPS $0.28 EXCLUDING QSI SEGMENT SAN DIEGO - January 19, 2005 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for its first quarter fiscal 2005 ended December 26, 2004. Revenues were $1.4 billion in the first fiscal quarter, up 15 percent year-over-year and 24 percent sequentially(1). First fiscal quarter net income was $513 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.30, up 46 percent and 43 percent, respectively, year-over-year, and up 31 percent and 30 percent, respectively, sequentially(1). Revenues excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment were $1.4 billion in the first fiscal quarter, up 21 percent year-over-year and 1 percent sequentially, when compared to 2004 results excluding QSI prepared under the "New Method"(1) of recording royalties. First fiscal quarter net income excluding the QSI segment was $474 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.28, up 21 percent and 17 percent, respectively, year-over-year, and down 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, sequentially. Throughout, comparative results excluding the QSI segment are presented as if the New Method had been in use in the prior year. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM results excluding QSI (for the first quarter fiscal 2005) and between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM results excluding QSI prepared under the New Method of recording royalties (for each quarter in 2004 and in total) are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com. - -------------------- (1)The New Method of recording royalties is based solely on reports received from licensees for royalty bearing sales of equipment in the prior quarter. The Company adopted this New Method during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 on a prospective basis. Under the Prior Method of recording royalties, the Company recorded an estimate of earned royalties in the quarter preceding its receipt of licensee reports. As a result of the change, GAAP results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflect only partial economic performance of the Companys licensing business as royalty revenue that would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Results under the New Method are presented herein to assist investors with evaluating financial performance on a comparable basis. - -more-
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 2 of 19 "The deployment and expansion of third generation (3G) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks and devices continues to drive our results," said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) contributed 32 percent to our royalty revenues from September quarter shipments, demonstrating further expansion of WCDMA networks and increasing device sales. Consumers and enterprises worldwide are attracted by and benefiting from an increasing range of entertaining and useful applications. The downloading of applications and content to wireless phones has grown dramatically, providing incremental revenue growth to 3G operators. By November of 2003, there had been more than 60 million downloads of BREW applications since the first BREW operator launched services in November of 2001. By November of 2004, over 200 million downloads of applications had occurred using the BREW system. BREW is now offered by 37 operators in 24 countries under various service brand names and the BREW developer community is thriving." "With the transition to 3G CDMA well under way, the growing demand for advanced features and services at an affordable market price is compelling operators to further upgrade to the higher data rates and resulting lower cost enabled by 1xEV-DO for CDMA2000(R) and by HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), available soon for WCDMA. CDMA2000 operators are rapidly expanding 1xEV-DO networks and using the increased capacity to offer multimedia services, which have proven popular in Korea and Japan. We recently announced first samples of the CSM6800(TM), the base station chip that supports CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A. With higher speed, especially on the reverse link, as well as lower latency, Revision A, when deployed, will enable the consumer and enterprise to not only receive, but also send large amounts of data using their wireless device. Revision A is designed to support fully-competitive push-to-talk services and high capacity, high quality VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). Competition among network operators is clearly speeding the 2G to 3G transition and the further evolution of 3G performance, services, and devices." "The wireless market is changing rapidly and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The mobile phone is becoming the essential consumer device and our strategy of comprehensive feature integration in our Mobile Station Modem(TM) (MSM(TM)) digital chipset is enabling convergence of a broad array of consumer functions within the ubiquitous phone. In a complementary cycle, the
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 3 of 19 BREW platform supports the availability of compelling applications in the marketplace to take advantage of these advanced features." Research and development (R&D) expenses were $228 million in the first fiscal quarter, up 52 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increased headcount related to development of integrated circuit products and initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products including CDMA2000(R) 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, and HSDPA. This includes $9 million in R&D expenses attributable to the QSI segment. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $148 million in the first fiscal quarter, up 25 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in employee related headcount expenses to support our growing worldwide customer base, and professional fees related to legal, patent and audit activities. This includes $5 million in SG&A expenses attributable to the QSI segment. Our fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 28 percent, compared to approximately 25 percent in fiscal 2004. Excluding the QSI segment, our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 30 percent, compared to 27 percent in fiscal 2004. The increased estimated annual effective tax rates as compared to the prior fiscal year are primarily due to proportionately less foreign earnings subject to a lower rate. The 2004 Working Families Act, enacted on October 4, 2004, extended the research and development tax credit. As a result, the effective tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of approximately 27 percent for total QUALCOMM and 29 percent excluding QSI are lower than the expected annual effective tax rates. QUALCOMM STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. The first quarter fiscal 2005 results consisted primarily of $51 million in net realized gains on investments and $3 million in gains on derivative instruments, partially offset by $14 million of operating expenses, including $9 million in R&D costs related to MediaFLO(TM) USA. Total QUALCOMM results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 include $0.02 of diluted earnings per share for the QSI segment.
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 4 of 19 BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. This outlook does not include the effects in the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 from expensing equity-based compensation programs under SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which is scheduled to be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will not adopt the revised standard prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. CORE BUSINESS OUTLOOK Comparisons of fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2004 for our core business (excluding the QSI segment) provided below present fiscal 2004 annual and quarterly results assuming application of the New Method of recording royalties based solely on reports received from licensees. FISCAL 2005 Based on the current business outlook, we are reiterating our prior revenue guidance and increasing our earnings guidance for fiscal 2005 excluding the QSI segment. We are also reiterating our prior calendar year CDMA market guidance and our estimate of fiscal 2005 CDMA phone average selling price. We anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment will be in the range of approximately $5.8-$6.3 billion, an increase of 16-26 percent year-over-year. We anticipate diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $1.16-$1.20 for fiscal 2005, an increase of 8-12 percent year-over-year. We estimate the CDMA phone market to be in the range of 218-228 million units in calendar 2005. Based on the 223 million unit midpoint of this estimate, we anticipate shipments of approximately 168
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 5 of 19 million CDMA2000 units and approximately 55 million WCDMA units. We anticipate average selling prices for CDMA phones, CDMA2000 and WCDMA combined, to increase 5 percent in fiscal 2005 to approximately $215 per unit, compared to approximately $205 in fiscal 2004. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that revenues excluding the QSI segment in the second fiscal quarter will be in the range of approximately $1.35-$1.45 billion, an increase of 14-22 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that diluted earnings per share excluding the QSI segment will be approximately $0.25-$0.27 in the second fiscal quarter, compared to $0.26 in the prior year. This estimate assumes shipments of approximately 35-37 million MSM phone chips during the quarter. We anticipate worldwide CDMA/WCDMA phone shipments of approximately 46-49 million units in the December quarter at an average selling price of approximately $214 per unit. Under the New Method, royalty revenues in the second fiscal quarter will be based solely on reports received from licensees for royalty bearing sales of equipment in the prior quarter ended December 26, 2004. GAAP OUTLOOK We compare 2005 GAAP outlook below to GAAP results for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 GAAP results are based on the Prior Method through the third quarter and reflect only partial economic performance of the Company's licensing business in the fourth quarter. FISCAL 2005 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues will be in the range of approximately $5.8-$6.3 billion, an increase of 18-29 percent year-over-year. We are increasing our earnings guidance for total QUALCOMM and now anticipate diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2005 will be approximately $1.15-$1.19, an increase of 12-16 percent year-over-year and including an estimated $0.01 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005 Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate that total QUALCOMM revenues in the second quarter will be in the range of approximately $1.35-$1.45 billion, an increase of 11-19 percent year-over-year. We anticipate that total QUALCOMM earnings per share will be approximately
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 6 of 19 $0.24-$0.26 in the second fiscal quarter, a decrease of 10-17 percent year-over-year and including an estimated $0.01 loss per share attributed to the QSI segment. CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $8.0 billion at the end of the first quarter fiscal 2005, compared to $7.6 billion on September 26, 2004 and $5.9 billion on December 28, 2003. We paid $176 million in cash for business acquisitions in the first quarter fiscal 2005. In the first quarter fiscal 2005, net cash transfers to QSI were $28 million. Detailed reconciliations between changes in total QUALCOMM GAAP cash flow and changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and total QUALCOMM excluding the QSI segment are included at the end of this news release.
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 7 of 19 RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following tables, which present segment information, have been adjusted to reflect the 2005 segment presentation (Notes 1 and 2), as well as to present QTL results for fiscal year 2004 as if the New Method of recognizing QTL revenues had been in effect for the entire year. GAAP equivalents and reconciliations for fiscal 2004 periods are included at the end of this news release (dollars in millions, except per share data): FIRST QUATER - FISCAL YEAR 2005 FOURTH QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 SECOND QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 FIRST QUARTER - FISCAL YEAR 2004 TWELVE MONTHS - FISCAL YEAR 2004 (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position location technology. As a result of the reorganization of SnapTrack,
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 8 of 19 revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's server software business (software for location-based services and applications) that were previously presented in the QCT segment became part of the QIS division in the QWI segment. Segment information for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. (2) During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reorganized its MediaFLO USA business into the QSI segment. The operating expenses related to the MediaFLO USA business were included in reconciling items through the end of fiscal 2004. Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reorganized a division in the QWI segment that develops and sells test tools into the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. (3) Reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other non-reportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Reconciling items related to earnings before taxes consist primarily of corporate expenses, charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes, unallocated net investment income, non-reportable segment results, interest expense and the elimination of intercompany profit. (4) The Company effected a two-for-one stock split in August 2004. All references to number of shares and per share amounts reflect the stock split. (5) QTL's results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflect the Company's decision to make the prospective change to the New Method of recording royalties based solely on reports received from licensees for royalty bearing sales of equipment in the prior quarter. This change had the one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Therefore, GAAP results for fiscal 2004 do not reflect a full year of the economic performance of the Company's licensing business, as royalty revenue that would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Results using the New Method of recording royalties are presented for prior periods to illustrate the differences between the Prior Method of recording royalties and the New Method implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. * As adjusted as described in the notes above. N/M - Not Meaningful Sums may not equal totals due to rounding.

This achievement marks the ongoing momentum for the BREW solution within the rapidly expanding global wireless industry. As of November 2004, 37 wireless operators were offering BREW services in 24 countries and cumulative BREW application downloads exceeded 200 million worldwide. - Announced advanced firmware over-the-air (FOTA) update capabilities via the BREW solution in conjunction with Insignia Solutions and Bitfone Corporation. These capabilities enable wireless operators and handset manufacturers to remotely reflash a BREW-enabled device's firmware-repairing software flaws or adding new functions-thus eliminating the
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 11 of 19 need for more costly and time-consuming in-store cable-based updates and massive device recalls. - Collaborated with Opera Software to give mobile users a more flexible shopping experience on their handsets. These new capabilities via Opera's mobile Web browser and the BREW solution allow operators to enhance their subscribers' wireless Internet experience by providing them with a feature-rich shopping experience, via BREW-enabled handsets. This advanced shopping experience gives users the opportunity to purchase and download contextually relevant content such as applications, ringtones, wallpapers and skins. - In October 2004, QUALCOMM completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Trigenix Limited (Trigenix), a United Kingdom-based developer of user interfaces for mobile phones for approximately $35 million, excluding assumed liabilities. Trigenix's suite of technologies provides additional substantial advantages to QUALCOMM's existing user interface offerings that enable flexible and customizable wireless device user interface for wireless operators and device manufacturers. QUALCOMM WIRELESS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS(R) (QWBS) - Shipped approximately 13,300 satellite-based systems (OmniTRACS(R), TruckMAIL(TM)) and more than 11,600 terrestrial-based systems (OmniExpress(R), GlobalTRACS(R), T2(TM) Untethered TrailerTRACS(R) and LINQ) in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

CONFERENCE CALL QUALCOMM's first quarter fiscal 2005 earnings conference call will be broadcast live on January 19, 2005 beginning at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Company's web site at: www.qualcomm.com. This conference call may contain forward-looking financial information. The conference call will include a discussion of "non-GAAP financial measures" as that term is defined in Regulation G. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as the other material financial and statistical information to be discussed in the conference call, will be posted on the Company's Investor Relations web site at www.qualcomm.com immediately prior to commencement of the call. A taped audio replay will
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 13 of 19 be available via telephone on January 19, 2005 beginning at approximately 4:30 p.m. (PST) through February 3, 2005 at 4:30 p.m. (PST). To listen to the replay, U.S. callers may dial (800) 633-8284 and international callers may dial (402) 977-9140. U.S. and international callers should use reservation number 21219395. An audio replay of the conference call will be available on the Company's web site at www.qualcomm.com for two weeks following the live call. QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2003 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM. NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company presents financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance. The Company presents cash flow information excluding QSI and including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash
QUALCOMM Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Page 14 of 19 management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company presents financial results as though the New Method of recording royalties had been in effect for prior periods to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and results excluding QSI, QUALCOMM results and results using the New Method and total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and total QUALCOMM excluding the QSI segment are presented herein. NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA based networks and CDMA based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEVDO and WCDMA, both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; developments in current and future litigation, as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports. ### QUALCOMM(R), Mobile Station Modem(TM), MSM(TM), FLO(TM), MediaFLO(TM), gpsOne(TM), CSM(TM), Qtv(TM), MSM6250(TM), MSM6255(TM), MSM6500(TM), MSM6550(TM), MSM6300(TM), radioOne(TM), powerOne(TM), RFL6202(TM), RFR6202(TM), RTR6250(TM), RFR6122(TM), RFT6122(TM), PM6650(TM), BREW(R), QChat(R), QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions(R), TruckMAIL(TM), OmniTRACS(R), OmniExpress(R), GlobalTRACS(R), T2(TM) and TrailerTRACS(R) are trademarks and/or service marks of QUALCOMM Incorporated.

      -. Mr. Sulpizio was granted an option, under the Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan (the "2001 Plan"), to purchase 18,000 shares of Company stock at an exercise price of $37.39 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on March 8, 2005 (the date of grant). The vesting and service requirements for these 18,000 options are identical in all material respects to the terms and conditions of stock options granted to members of the Company's Board of Directors. In particular, the 18,000 options vest and become exercisable over a five year period. During the first year, ten percent of the options vest at the six month anniversary and thereafter 1/60th of the total options vest on a monthly basis. A copy of this stock option agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Stock Option for Director Service
      -. Mr. Sulpizio was also granted an option under the 2001 Plan to purchase 157,000 shares of Company stock at an exercise price of $37.39 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on March 8, 2005 (the date of grant). Twenty percent of these 157,000 shares become vested and exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter 1/60th of the total options vest on a monthly basis. The only service recognized under this 157,000 option grant for the purpose of vesting is Mr. Sulpizio's service as an employee of the Company (and consequently if Mr. Sulpizio terminates employment but remains a Company director, the option will be handled as if Mr. Sulpizio no longer provided service to the Company). A copy of this stock option agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.2.
Stock Option for Employee Service
. On March 7, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). The Directors' Plan provides for the automatic grant of stock options to non-employee directors. The Directors' Plan's share reserve and all outstanding stock options granted under the Director Plan were automatically adjusted to reflect the Company's stock dividend in August of 2004. However, the number of stock options granted automatically to non-employee directors under the Director Plan was not adjusted automatically to reflect the Company's stock dividend. Consequently, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved the adoption of an amendment to the Director Plan which increased the number of initial options to be granted to new directors upon first becoming a non-employee director from 20,000 to 36,000 and the number of annual options granted from 10,000 to 18,000. A copy of the amended Directors' Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
Amendment of 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan
. In compliance with recent Securities and Exchange Commission interpretive guidance issued with respect to disclosure of executive compensation, the Company is disclosing the following items which the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") may deem to be material definitive agreements.

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT Pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Stock Option Agreement, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") has granted you an Option to purchase the number of shares of the Company's common stock ("Stock") indicated in the Grant Notice at the exercise price indicated in the Grant Notice.

The details of this Option are as follows: 1. VESTING. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, this option will vest as provided in the Grant Notice. 2. SERVICE. For the purposes of this Stock Option Agreement, the defined term "Service" as set forth in Section 2.1(dd) of the Plan shall be replaced and consequently, for all purposes under this Option, "Service" shall mean your employment or service with the Participating Company Group solely in the capacity of an Employee. Your Service shall be deemed to have terminated once you no longer are an Employee, even if you continue to render service to the Participating Company Group in any other capacity, such as a Consultant or Director. Furthermore, only to such extent as may be provided by the Company's leave policy, your Service as an Employee with the Participating Company Group shall not be deemed to have terminated if you take any military leave, sick leave, or other leave of absence approved by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a leave of absence shall be treated as Service for purposes of vesting only to such extent as may be provided by the Company's leave policy. Your Service shall be deemed to have terminated either upon an actual termination of Service as an Employee or upon the entity for which you perform Service ceasing to be a Participating Company; except that if the entity for which you perform Service is a Subsidiary Corporation and ceases to be a Participating Company as a result of the distribution of the voting stock of such Subsidiary Corporation to the shareholders of the Company, Service shall not be deemed to have terminated as a result of such distribution. The Company, in its discretion, shall determine whether your Service has terminated and the effective date of such termination. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth above, your Service as an Employee shall not be deemed to have terminated merely because the Participating Company for which you render Service ceases to be a member of the Participating Company Group by reason of a Spinoff Transaction, nor shall your Service be deemed to have terminated upon resumption of Service from the Spinoff Company to a Participating Company. For all purposes under the Plan and this Stock Option Agreement, your Service shall include Service as an Employee for the Spinoff Company provided you were employed by the Participating Company Group immediately prior to the Spinoff Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company's auditors determine that the provisions or operation of the preceding two sentences would cause the Company to incur a compensation expense and provided further that in the absence of the preceding two sentences no such compensation expense would be incurred, then the Company may unilaterally determine that the two preceding sentences shall be without force or effect, and the vesting and exercisability of 1
each outstanding Option and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof shall be determined under any other applicable provision of the Plan. 3. EXERCISE OF THE OPTION. 3.1 METHOD OF EXERCISE.

The Participant's Service shall be deemed to have terminated either upon an actual termination of Service or upon the entity for which the Participant performs Service ceasing to be a Participating Company; except that if the entity for which the Participant performs Service is a Subsidiary Corporation and ceases to be a Participating Company as a result of the distribution of the voting stock of such Subsidiary Corporation to the shareholders of the Company or a Parent Corporation, Service shall not be deemed to have terminated as a result of such distribution. Subject to the foregoing, the Company, in its discretion, shall determine whether the Participant's Service has terminated and the effective date of such termination.

Any decision or determination of the Company made by an Officer having actual authority with respect thereto, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Participating Company Group, any Participant, and all persons having an interest in the Plan, or any Option granted hereunder, unless such Officer's decision or determination is arbitrary or capricious, fraudulent, or made in bad faith. 3.3 POWERS OF THE BOARD. In addition to any other powers set forth in the Plan and subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the full and final power and authority, in its discretion: (a) To construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan and Options granted under it, in its discretion; to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration, and to take all such actions and make all such decisions as may be necessary or
appropriate for the operation and administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, all such decisions and determinations as may be expressly delegated to the Board by the terms of the Plan. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem, in its discretion, necessary, desirable, appropriate or expedient to make the Plan fully effective. (b) To amend the Plan or an Option as provided in Section 11.

The Board may abolish, or limit the powers of, the Committee at any time and revest in the Board all or some of the administration of the Plan. 3.5 INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or Officers or Employees of the Participating Company Group, members of the Board and any Officers or Employees of the Participating Company Group to whom authority to act for the Board or the Company is delegated shall be indemnified by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall offer to the Company, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same, and to retain complete control over the litigation and/or settlement of such suit, action or proceeding.
3.6 ARBITRATION. Any dispute or claim concerning any Options granted (or not granted) pursuant to this Plan and any other disputes or claims relating to or arising out of the Plan shall be fully, finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Diego, California. By accepting an Option, Participants and the Company waive their respective rights to have any such disputes or claims tried by a judge or jury. 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN. 4.1 MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be Twelve Million Six Hundred Thousand (12,600,000) (after adjustment to reflect the Company's stock dividend on August 13, 2004). The share reserve shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof. However, the share reserve, determined at any time, shall be reduced by the number of shares subject to the Prior Plan Options. If an outstanding Option, including a Prior Plan Option, for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or if shares of Stock are acquired upon the exercise of an Option subject to a Company repurchase option and are repurchased by the Company at the Participant's exercise or purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of such Option or Prior Plan Option or such repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. 4.2 ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares subject to the Plan and in the exercise price per share of any outstanding Options. If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Options are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event, as defined in Section 2.1(u)) shares of another corporation (the "NEW SHARES"), the Board may unilaterally amend the outstanding Options to provide that such Options are exercisable for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise price per share of, the outstanding Options shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Board, in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise price of any Option be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION. Only those persons who, at the time of grant, are serving as Non-Employee Directors shall be eligible to become Participants and to be granted an Option. 6. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS. Options shall be evidenced by Option Agreements specifying, among other things, the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Board shall from time to time
establish. Option Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions: 6.1 AUTOMATIC GRANT. Subject to the execution by a Non-Employee Director of an appropriate Option Agreement, Options shall be granted automatically and without further action of the Board, as follows: (a) INITIAL OPTION PRIOR TO AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director shall be granted an Option to purchase twenty thousand (20,000) shares of Stock (an "INITIAL OPTION") on the date such person first becomes a Non-Employee Director after the Effective Date; provided, however, that an Initial Option shall not be granted to a Director who is an Employee and who subsequently becomes a Non-Employee Director as a result of the termination of his or her status as an Employee. (b) INITIAL OPTION AFTER AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director shall be granted an Initial Option to purchase thirty six thousand (36,000) shares of Stock on the date such person first becomes a Non-Employee Director after the Amendment Date; provided, however, that an Initial Option shall not be granted to a Director who is an Employee and who subsequently becomes a Non-Employee Director as a result of the termination of his or her status as an Employee. (c) ANNUAL OPTION PRIOR TO AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who previously did not qualify as a Non-Employee Director because of his or her status as an Employee) was granted, prior to the Amendment Date, on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company (an "ANNUAL MEETING") immediately following which such person remains a Non-Employee Director, an Option to purchase ten thousand (10,000) shares of Stock (an "ANNUAL OPTION"); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director granted an Initial Option on, or within a period of 270 days prior to, the date of an Annual Meeting shall not be granted an Annual Option for such Annual Meeting. (d) ANNUAL OPTION AFTER AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who previously did not qualify as a Non-Employee Director because of his or her status as an Employee) shall be granted, after the Amendment Date, on the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which such person remains a Non-Employee Director, an Annual Option to purchase eighteen thousand (18,000) shares of Stock; provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director granted an Initial Option on, or within a period of 270 days prior to, the date of an Annual Meeting shall not be granted an Annual Option for such Annual Meeting. (e) RIGHT TO DECLINE OPTION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person may elect not to receive an Option pursuant to this Section by delivering written notice of such election to the Board no later than the day prior to the date such Option would otherwise be granted. A person so declining an Option shall receive no payment or other consideration in lieu of such declined Option. A person who has declined an Option may revoke such election by delivering written notice of such revocation to the Board no later than the day prior to the date such Option would be granted pursuant to Section 6.1(a), (b), (c) or (d) as the case may be.
6.2 EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share of Stock subject to an Option shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of the Option. 6.3 EXERCISABILITY AND TERM OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall vest and become exercisable as set forth below and shall terminate and cease to be exercisable on the tenth (10) anniversary date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Plan or the Option Agreement evidencing such Option. (a) INITIAL OPTIONS. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option, each Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable as follows: (i) twenty percent (20%) of the Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the Option, and (ii) 1/60th of the Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable each month, beginning on the date thirteen 13 months after the date of grant of the Option, provided the Participant's Service has not been terminated prior to such date. (b) ANNUAL OPTIONS. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option, each Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable as follows: (i) ten percent (10%) of the Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable on the date six (6) months after the grant of the Option, and (ii) 1/60th of the Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable each month, beginning on the date seven (7) months after the date of grant of the Option, provided the Participant's Service has not terminated prior to such date. 6.4 EARLY EXERCISE. The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionholder may elect at any time while an Employee, Director or Consultant to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Any unvested shares so purchased shall be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company, with the repurchase price to be equal to the original purchase price of the Common Stock, or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate; provided, however, that (i) the right to repurchase at the original purchase price shall lapse at the same rate as the Option vests as described elsewhere in the Plan, and (ii) such right shall be exercisable only within (A) the ninety (90) day period following the termination of the Participant's Service or (B) such longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the Participant. 6.5 PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. (a) FORMS OF CONSIDERATION AUTHORIZED. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i) in cash, by check or cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value not less than the exercise price, (iii) by delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (a "CASHLESS EXERCISE"), (iv) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Board from time to time to the extent permitted by
applicable law, or (v) by any combination thereof. The Board may at any time or from time to time, by approval of or amendment to the standard form of Option Agreement, grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration. (b) LIMITATIONS ON FORMS OF CONSIDERATION. (i) TENDER OF STOCK. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company's stock. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months (and were not used for another Option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company. (ii) CASHLESS EXERCISE. The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise. 6.6 TRANSFERABILITY. An Option shall not be transferable in any manner (including without limitation, sale, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, or assignment) other than, (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) by written designation of a beneficiary, in a form acceptable to the Company, with such designation taking effect upon the death of a Participant, (iii) by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form acceptable to the Company (including such representations, warranties and indemnifications as the Company shall require a Participant to make to protect the Company's interests and ensure that this Option has been transferred under the circumstances approved by the Company), by gift to a Participant's spouse, former spouse, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parent, stepparent, grandparent, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, persons having one of the foregoing types of relationship with a Participant due to adoption, any person sharing a Participant's household (other than a tenant or employee), a foundation in which these persons or the Participant control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests. A transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by these persons (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity is specifically included as a permissible type of transfer. In addition, a transfer to a trust created solely for the benefit (i.e., a Participant and/or any or all of the foregoing persons hold more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest in the trust) of a Participant and/or any or all of the foregoing persons is also a permissible transferee, or (iv) such other transferees as may be authorized by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion. During a Participant's life this Option is exercisable only by the Participant or a transferee satisfying the above conditions. Except in the event of a Participant's death, upon transfer of an Option to any or all of the foregoing persons, the Participant, as the Optionee, is liable for any and all taxes due upon exercise of those transferred Options. At no time will a transferee who is considered an affiliate under Rule 144(a)(1) be able to sell any or all such Stock without complying with Rule 144. The right of a transferee to exercise the transferred portion of this Option shall terminate in
accordance with the Participant' s right of exercise under this Option and is further subject to such representations, warranties and indemnifications from the transferee that the Company requires the transferee to make to protect the Company's interests and ensure that this Option has been transferred under the circumstances approved by the Company. Once a portion of an Option is transferred, no further transfer may be made of that portion of the Option. 6.7 EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE. (a) OPTION EXERCISABILITY. Subject to earlier termination of the Option as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Board in the grant of an Option and set forth in the Option Agreement, an Option shall be exercisable after a Participant's termination of Service only during the applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section and thereafter shall terminate. (i) DISABILITY AND NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If a Participant's Service terminates because of the Participant's Disability or after the Participant reaches Normal Retirement Age, then except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7(a)(ii), (A) the Participant's Service shall be deemed to continue and the exercisability and vesting of the Option and, in the case of an immediately exercisable option, the shares acquired upon exercise thereof shall continue under the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement, and (B) the Option to the extent unexercised and exercisable may be exercised by the Participant (or, the Participant's guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of the Option's term as set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option (the "Option Expiration Date"). (ii) DEATH. If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, or if the Participant dies after attaining Normal Retirement Age, or after the Disability of the Participant then, (A) the exercisability and vesting of the Option and any shares acquired on the exercise thereof shall be accelerated effective as of the date of the Participant's death, and (B) the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date of the Participant's death, may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Participant's death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date of the Participant's death, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. (iii) OTHER TERMINATION OF SERVICE. If the Participant's Service with the Participating Company Group terminates prior to Normal Retirement Age for any reason except Disability, or death, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Participant on the date on which the Participant's Service terminates, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant's Service terminates, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. (b) EXTENSION IF EXERCISE PREVENTED BY LAW. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.7(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section 10 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Participant is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
(c) EXTENSION IF PARTICIPANT SUBJECT TO SECTION 16(B). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.7(a) of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Participant to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which a sale of such shares by the Participant would no longer be subject to such suit, (ii) the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Participant's termination of Service, or (iii) the Option Expiration Date. 7. STANDARD FORMS OF AGREEMENTS. 7.1 OPTION AGREEMENT. Unless otherwise provided by the Board at the time the Option is granted, an Option shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Option Agreement approved by the Board concurrently with its adoption of the Plan and as amended from time to time. 7.2 AUTHORITY TO VARY TERMS. The Board shall have the authority from time to time to vary the terms of any standard form of agreement described in this Section 7 either in connection with the grant or amendment of an individual Option or in connection with the authorization of a new standard form or forms; provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such new, revised or amended standard form or forms of agreement are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. 8. CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event of a Change in Control, any unexercisable or unvested portions of outstanding Options and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof held by Participants whose Service has not terminated prior to such date shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior to the date of the Change in Control. The exercise or vesting of any Option and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof that was permissible solely by reason of this Section shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control. In addition, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or parent corporation thereof, as the case may be (the "ACQUIRING CORPORATION"), may either assume the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially equivalent options for the Acquiring Corporation's stock. Any Options which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the outstanding Options immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 2.1(u)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the outstanding Options shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.
9. TAX WITHHOLDING. 9.1 TAX WITHHOLDING IN GENERAL. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require the Participant, through cash payment or otherwise, including by means of a Cashless Exercise of an Option, to make adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an Option or the shares acquired pursuant thereto. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock or to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Option Agreement until the Participating Company Group's tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant. 9.2 WITHHOLDING IN SHARES. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise of an Option, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates. 10. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAW. The grant of Options and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Options shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities. Options may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Option may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of any Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 11. TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time. However, subject to changes in applicable law, regulations or rules that would permit otherwise, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section 4.2), and (b) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the
Company's stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule. No termination or amendment of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Option unless expressly provided by the Board. In any event, no termination or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Option without the consent of the Participant, unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. 12. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. 12.1 REPURCHASE RIGHTS. Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to a right of first refusal, one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion at the time the Option is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions. 12.2 PROVISION OF INFORMATION. Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company's common stockholders.

Exhibit 99.5 RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF QUALCOMM INCORPORATED QUALCOMM Incorporated, a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY: FIRST: The name of this corporation is QUALCOMM Incorporated. This corporation was originally incorporated under the name "QUALCOMM, Inc." through the filing of a Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 15, 1991. A Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed on September 10, 1991 changing the name of the corporation to QUALCOMM Incorporated. SECOND: The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of QUALCOMM Incorporated, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit A only restates and integrates and does not further amend the provisions of this corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as heretofore amended or supplemented, and there is no discrepancy between those provisions and the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit A. THIRD: The Restated Certificate of Incorporation so adopted reads in full as set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto and hereby incorporated by reference. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, QUALCOMM Incorporated has caused this certificate to be signed by its Secretary this 9th day of March, 2005. QUALCOMM Incorporated By: /s/ Cameron Jay Rains -------------------------------------- Cameron Jay Rains Secretary
EXHIBIT A RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF QUALCOMM INCORPORATED I. The name of this corporation is QUALCOMM Incorporated. II. The address of the registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is 32 Loockerman Square, Suite L-100, City of Dover, County of Kent, and the name of the registered agent of the corporation in the State of Delaware as such address is The Prentice-Hall Corporation System, Inc. III. The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. IV. This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock." The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is six billion eight million (6,008,000,000) shares. Six billion (6,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). Eight million (8,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of one one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). V. The relative rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the respective classes and series of shares are as follows: A. COMMON STOCK. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as designated herein and as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the corporation upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.
B. PREFERRED STOCK. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a certificate pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of them (a "Preferred Stock Designation"); and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. On September 26, 1995, the Board of Directors created a series of Preferred Stock designated as the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The relative designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof (in addition to the provisions otherwise set forth in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which are applicable to the Preferred Stock of all classes and series), are as set forth in the resolutions attached hereto as Attachment 1. VI. For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that: A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors. Every stockholder entitled to vote in any election of directors of this corporation may cumulate such stockholder's votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the stockholder's shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following September 11, 1991 (the "Initial Election Date"), the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. 3
At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Initial Election Date, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Initial Election Date, the term of office of the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes shall be filled by either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") voting together as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. B. The Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal the Bylaws. C. The directors of the corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide. D. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent. E. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the corporation. F. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; 4
or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. So long as shareholders may cumulate their votes in the election of directors, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors, or, if there be classes of directors, at an election of the class of directors of which he is a part. Furthermore, if the holders of any class or series of capital stock are entitled to elect one (1) or more directors by this certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time, the removal of such directors without cause shall be by a vote of the outstanding shares of that series or class of capital stock and not the outstanding shares of capital stock as a whole. VII. A director of the corporation shall, to the full extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director. VIII. A. (1) In addition to any affirmative vote required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in Section B of this Article VIII: (i) any merger or consolidation of the corporation or any Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) with (a) any Interested Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) or (b) any other corporation (whether or not itself an Interested Stockholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of an Interested Stockholder; or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder of any assets of the corporation or any Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) equal to or greater than 15% of the Corporation's assets as set forth on the Corporation's most recent audited consolidated financial statements; or (iii) the issuance or transfer by the corporation or any Subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary to any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder in exchange for cash, securities or other property (or a combination thereof) having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to or greater than 15% of the Corporation's assets as set forth on the Corporation's most recent audited consolidated financial statements; or (iv) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; or 5
(v) any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or recapitalization of the corporation, or any merger or consolidation of the corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving any Interested Stockholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary which is Beneficially Owned (as hereinafter defined) by any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law or of any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote. (2) The term "Business Combination" as used in this Article VIII shall mean any transaction which is referred to in any one or more of subparagraphs (i) through (v) of paragraph (1) of this Section A. B. The provisions of Section A of this Article VIII shall not be applicable to any particular Business Combination, and such Business Combination shall require only such affirmative vote as is required by law, any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation and any Preferred Stock Designation, if, in the case of a Business Combination that does not involve any cash or other consideration being received by the stockholders of the corporation, solely in their respective capacities as stockholders of the corporation, the condition specified in the following paragraph (1) is met, or, in the case of any other Business Combination, the conditions specified in either of the following paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) are met: (1) The Business Combination shall have been approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors (as hereinafter defined); provided however, that this condition shall not be capable of satisfaction unless there are at least two Continuing Directors. (2) All of the following conditions shall have been met: (i) The consideration to be received by holders of shares of a particular class (or series) of outstanding Voting Stock (including Common Stock and other than Excluded Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined)) shall be in cash or in the same form as the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has previously paid for shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock. If the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates have paid for shares of any class (or series) of Voting Stock with varying forms of consideration, the form of consideration to be received per share by holders of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock shall be either cash or the form used to acquire the largest number of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock previously acquired by the Interested Stockholder. (ii) The aggregate amount of (x) the cash and (y) the Fair Market Value, as of the date (the "Consummation Date") of the consummation of the Business Combination, of the consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of Common Stock in such Business Combination shall be at least equal to the higher of the 6
following (in each case appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or similar event): (a) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates for any shares of Common Stock acquired by them within the two-year period immediately prior to the date of the first public announcement of the proposal of the Business Combination (the "Announcement Date") or in any transaction in which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from the first date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder (the "Determination Date") through the Consummation Date at the publicly announced reference rate of interest of Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. (or such other major bank headquartered in the State of California as may be selected by the Continuing Directors) from time to time in effect in the City of San Francisco less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the Fair Market Value of any dividends paid in other than cash, on each share of Common Stock from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of interest so payable per share of Common Stock; and (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Announcement Date or the Determination Date, whichever is higher. (iii) The aggregate amount of (x) the cash and (y) the Fair Market Value, as of the Consummation Date, of the consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of shares of any class (or series), other than Stock or Excluded Preferred Stock, of outstanding Voting Stock shall be at least equal to the highest of the following (in each case appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or similar event), it being intended that the requirements of this paragraph (2)(iii) shall be required to be met with respect to every such class (or series) of outstanding Voting Stock whether or not the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has previously acquired any shares of a particular class (or series) of Voting Stock): (a) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates for any shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock acquired by them within the two-year period immediately prior to the Announcement Date or in any transaction in which it became an Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date at the publicly announced reference rate of interest of Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. (or such other major bank headquartered in the State of California as may be selected by the Continuing Directors) from time to time in effect in the City of San Francisco less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the Fair Market Value of any dividends paid in other than cash, on each share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of interest so payable per share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock; 7
(b) the Fair Market Value per share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock on the Announcement Date or on the Determination Date, whichever is higher; and (c) the highest preferential amount per share, if any, to which the holders of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock would be entitled in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation. (iv) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested Stockholder and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination: (a) except as approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, there shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date therefor any full quarterly dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any outstanding Preferred Stock; (b) there shall have been (I) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock), except as approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, and (II) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any reverse stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, unless the failure so to increase such annual rate is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and (c) neither such Interested Stockholder nor any of its Affiliates shall have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock except as part of the transaction which results in such Interested Stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder; provided, however, that no approval by Continuing Directors shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph (iv) unless at the time of such approval there are at least two Continuing Directors. (v) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder and any of its Affiliates shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately, solely in such Interested Stockholder's or Affiliate's capacity as a stockholder of the corporation), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise. (vi) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to all stockholders of the corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).

ATTACHMENT 1 Resolutions of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated Creating the Designations, Powers, Preferences and Rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock "RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Corporation and hereby states the designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof (in addition to the provisions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, which are applicable to the Preferred Stock of all classes and series), as follows: Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock: SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT. One Million Five Hundred Thousand (1,500,000) shares of Preferred Stock, $.0001 par value, are designated "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" with the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions specified herein (the "Junior Preferred Stock"). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Junior Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Junior Preferred Stock. SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Junior Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of April, July, October and January in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. In the event the 13
Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Junior Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued by unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Junior Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Junior Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 14
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Junior Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Junior Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock; or (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Junior Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Junior Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. 15
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of Junior Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may by reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law. SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Junior Preferred stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a 16
subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION. The shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable. SECTION 9. RANK. The Junior Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock. SECTION 10. AMENDMENT. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Junior Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class." 17

stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, date and hour and purpose or purposes of the meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229). Section 8. QUORUM. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of Directors) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216). Section 9. ADJOURNMENT AND NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS. Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares casting votes, excluding abstentions. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222(c)). Section 10. VOTING RIGHTS.

Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so 4
either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All elections of Directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 211(e), 212(b)). (b) Every stockholder entitled to vote in any election of Directors of this corporation may cumulate such stockholder's votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of Directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the stockholder's shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of Directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 214). Section 11. JOINT OWNERS OF STOCK. If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 217(b)). Section 12. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every-meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 219(a)). Section 13. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. 5

Subject to any limitations imposed by the Certificate of Incorporation, the authorized number of Directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors by a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation. If for any cause, the Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 141(b), 211(b), (c)). Section 16. POWERS. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(a)). Section 17. CLASSES OF DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. At 6
each annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Section 18. VACANCIES. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes shall be filled by either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") voting together as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any Director, or if the stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which Directors are to be elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 21 below) to elect the number of Directors then constituting the whole Board of Directors. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 223(a), (b)). Section 19. RESIGNATION. Any Director may resign at any time by delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. When one or more Directors shall resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the Directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 141(b), 223(d)). Section 20. REMOVAL. Subject to any limitations imposed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, or any individual Director, may be removed from office at any time (a) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of Directors; or (b) without cause by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such outstanding shares. So long as shareholders may cumulate their votes in the election of Directors, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no Director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors, or, if there 7
be classes of Directors, at an election of the class of Directors of which he is a part. Furthermore, if the holders of any class or series of capital stock are entitled to elect one (1) or more Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time, the removal of such Directors without cause shall be by a vote of the outstanding shares of that series or class of capital stock and not the outstanding shares of capital stock as a whole. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(k)). Section 21. MEETINGS. (a) Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders and at the place where such meeting is held.

Any member of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(i)). (e) Notice of Meetings. Written notice of the time and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be given at least twenty-four (24) hours before the date of the meeting.

(Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 229). (f) Waiver of Notice. The transaction of all business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or noticed, or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the Directors not present shall sign a written waiver of notice, or a consent to holding such meeting, or an approval of the minutes 8
thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 229). Section 22. QUORUM AND VOTING. (a) Unless the Certificate of Incorporation requires a greater number and except with respect to indemnification questions arising under Section 43 hereof, for which a quorum shall be one-third of the exact number of Directors fixed from time to time in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, but not less than one (1), a quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a majority of the exact number of Directors fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, but not less than one (1); provided, however, at any meeting whether a quorum be present or otherwise, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors, without notice other than by announcement at the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(b)). (b) At each meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present, all questions and business shall be determined by a vote of a majority of the Directors present, unless a different vote be required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(b)). Section 23. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and such writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 141(f)). Section 24. FEES AND COMPENSATION. Directors shall be entitled to such compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors, including, if so approved, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors and at any meeting of a committee of the Board of Directors. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee, or otherwise and receiving compensation therefor.

The Board of Directors may by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors appoint an Executive Committee to consist of one (1) or more members of the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and specifically granted by the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise when the Board of Directors is not in session all powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, including, without limitation, the power and authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock, except such committee shall not have the power or authority to amend the Certificate of Incorporation, to adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation, to recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease 9
or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, to recommend to the stockholders of the corporation a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution or to amend these Bylaws.

Unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise provide, regular meetings of the Executive Committee or any other committee appointed pursuant to this Section 25 shall be held at such times and places as are determined by the Board of Directors, or by any such committee, and when notice thereof has been given to each member of such committee, no further notice of such regular meetings need be given thereafter.

Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.

The corporation shall indemnify its Directors and executive officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the corporation may limit the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its Directors and executive officers; and, provided, further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against the corporation or its Directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation or (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law. (b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents. The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. (c) Good Faith. (i) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or executive officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by: 17
(A) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the matters the Director or executive officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (B) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or executive officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and (C) with respect to a Director, a committee of the Board upon which such Director does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee the Director believes to merit confidence; so long as, in each case, the Director or executive officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted. (ii) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. (iii) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law. (d) Expenses. The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. (e) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent 18
jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for, the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. (f) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law. (g) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. (h) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw. (i) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation. (j) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. (k) Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply: 19
(i) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. (ii) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys' fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding. (iii) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. (iv) References to a "director," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. (v) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Bylaw. ARTICLE XII NOTICES Section 44. NOTICES. (a) Notice to Stockholders. Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, it shall be given in writing, timely and duly deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to his last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222). 20
(b) Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any Director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by facsimile, telex, telegram, commercial courier service, personal delivery, telephone, voice message system or electronic transmission, except that such notice other than one which is delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such Director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such Director. (c) Address Unknown. If no address of a stockholder or Director be known, notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 hereof. (d) Affidavit of Mailing. An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or Director or Directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall be conclusive evidence of the statements therein contained. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222). (e) Time Notices Deemed Given. All notices given by mail or commercial courier service, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of dispatch, all notices by personal delivery or telephone shall be deemed to have been given as of receipt by the designee or a person accepting notice on behalf of such director, and all notices given by facsimile, telex, telegram, voice message system or electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given as of the sending time recorded at the time of transmission. (f) Methods of Notice. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all Directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. (g) Failure to Receive Notice. The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any Director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such Director to receive such notice. (h) Notice to Person with Whom Communication Is Unlawful. Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall 21
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. (i) Notice to Person with Undeliverable Address. Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom (i) notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to such person during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (ii) all, and at least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a twelve- month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at his address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this paragraph. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 230). ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENTS Section 45. AMENDMENTS. Except as otherwise set forth in paragraph (i) of Section 43 of these Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. The Board of Directors shall also have the power, if such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation, to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 109(a), 122(6)). ARTICLE XIV LOANS TO OFFICERS Section 46. LOANS TO OFFICERS. The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who is a Director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation, except as prohibited by law. The loan, guarantee or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 143). 22
ARTICLE XV MISCELLANEOUS Section 47. ANNUAL REPORT. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the Board of Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder of the corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the corporation's fiscal year. Such report shall include a balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon of independent accounts or, if there is no such report, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation. When there are more than 100 stockholders of record of the corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California Corporations Code, additional information as required by Section 1501(b) of the California Corporations Code shall also be contained in such report, provided that if the corporation has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, that Act shall take precedence. Such report shall be sent to stockholders at least fifteen (15) days prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders after the end of the fiscal year to which it relates. (b) If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of the corporation's shares, the requirement of sending of an annual report to the stockholders of the corporation is hereby expressly waived. 23

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 20, 2005, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2005. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, which would otherwise be required by GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP information to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
     The attached press release also presents 2004 pro forma financial information as though the new method of recording royalties, based solely on reports from licensees, had been in effect for the entire year to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     The attached press release also presents 2005 pro forma financial information excluding a one-time tax benefit related to fiscal 2004 to provide management, as well as investors, a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results are presented in the press release. The pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
     The attached press release also presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity. The pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1

Total QUALCOMM Second Quarter Results:
QUALCOMM Pro Forma Second Quarter Results:

"QUALCOMM's second quarter results, highlighted by year-over-year growth in third generation (3G) chipsets and royalties for both CDMA2000 and WCDMA technologies, indicate increasing 3G market momentum," said Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "We continue our strategy of strong research and development investment and broad support of operators and manufacturers worldwide to foster our product leadership and industry growth. Customer acceptance of our CDMA2000 1xEV-DO chipset solutions continues to increase. More than 100 commercial devices are currently available or in design based on QUALCOMM's latest Multimedia Platform Mobile Station Modem (MSM) MSM6500 and Enhanced Multimedia Platform MSM6550 chipset solutions. With devices powered by the Company's 1xEV-DO chipsets, wireless consumers can download email and share files, photos, video and more on networks with broadband mobility speeds that rival fixed DSL connections."
Jacobs added, "We are further enhancing our BREW wireless data platform to support an increased range of system capabilities and of applications supporting subscriber interest in multimedia and 3D gaming. QUALCOMM's experience in pioneering mobile broadband 1xEV-DO has allowed us to accelerate our HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access for WCDMA) efforts versus our competition. We sampled the industry's first HSDPA chipset, the MSM6275, in December 2004 and continue to expand our HSDPA chipset portfolio from entry-priced, MSM6260-enabled handsets to high-end devices enabled by the MSM6280 solution. The future possibilities supported by increasingly ubiquitous wireless broadband and increasingly powerful devices continue to excite and motivate our entire company."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to $7.6 billion on September 26, 2004 and $6.6 billion on March 28, 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced a 29 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.07 to $0.09 per share. The dividend increase will be effective for quarterly dividends payable starting in the third quarter. We also doubled the Company's stock repurchase authority to $2 billion and, through March 27, 2005, repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares of stock at a net cost of approximately $230 million. The previous $1 billion stock repurchase plan expired February 9, 2005. In connection with the stock repurchase program, we sold a put option that may require us to repurchase an additional 5.75 million shares at approximately $33.75 per share for a net cost of approximately $194 million. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, net cash transfers to QSI were $7 million. Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM GAAP cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are included at the end of this news release.
Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) expenses were $252 million in the second fiscal quarter, up 49 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increased headcount related to development of integrated circuit products and initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA. This increase includes $10 million in R&D expenses attributable to MediaFLOUSA in the QSI segment, as compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $155 million in the second fiscal quarter, up 15 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in headcount to support our growing worldwide customer base, professional fees related to legal, patent and audit activities, and the effect of other income in the prior year quarter related to the transfers of portions of our FCC Auction Discount Voucher. This increase includes $6 million in SG&A expenses attributable to the QSI segment, as compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter, which were more than offset by other income related to the FCC Auction Discount Voucher.
 
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate is now estimated to be approximately 24 percent, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 28 percent. Our fiscal 2005 pro forma effective tax rate is now estimated to be approximately 28 percent, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 30 percent. The decrease in our estimated annual effective tax rates is primarily the result of a change in the estimate of the amount of R&D costs allocable to our foreign operations under an intercompany cost sharing agreement, resulting in increased foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate. Due to this change in estimate, our effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 for total QUALCOMM includes a $55 million tax benefit, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share, related to fiscal 2004 and a $17 million tax benefit, or $0.01 diluted earnings per share, related to the first quarter of fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005 pro forma presentation, we excluded the tax benefit attributable to fiscal 2004. As a result of these tax benefits, the effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 of approximately 16% for total QUALCOMM and 27% for QUALCOMM pro forma are lower than the estimated annual effective rates.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. The second quarter of fiscal 2005 results consisted primarily of $18 million in equity losses and $16 million of operating expenses, including $10 million in R&D costs related to MediaFLO USA. Total QUALCOMM results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 include $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment, compared to $0.02 diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
 
A pro forma outlook is provided below consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein. Total QUALCOMM outlook for fiscal 2005 is compared to total QUALCOMM results for fiscal 2004 which reflect only partial economic performance of the Company's licensing business in the fourth quarter due to the prospective change to the New Method during that period.
Our revised guidance, as compared to our prior fiscal year 2005 guidance, reflects a lower acceleration of WCDMA handset sales as operators optimize their WCDMA networks, anticipate future lower-priced handsets, and work to identify successful pricing and marketing strategies for new wireless voice and data services. We are reducing our calendar 2005 handset estimate by approximately five percent due to a slower WCDMA ramp-up in Western Europe and anticipated channel inventory adjustments in CDMA2000, notably for Latin America and Southeast Asia. However, we expect increasing market share for our WCDMA chipsets. This will be discussed in more detail during our second quarter conference call. This call is scheduled for 3:00pm (PDT) on Wednesday April 20, 2005. See the end of this press release for conference call dial-in information.

Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative measure of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
The Company presents pro forma financial results as though the New Method of recording royalties had been in effect for prior periods to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company presents pro forma results for fiscal 2005 excluding a one-time tax benefit related to fiscal 2004 to provide management, as well as investors, a clearer understanding of its ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 
Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM cash flow and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and total QUALCOMM excluding the QSI segment are presented herein.

Explanatory note
This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A is filed solely to: (i) revise the disclosure in the QUALCOMM Incorporated Form 8-K filed March 11, 2005 (the "Initial Filing") regarding the initial number of options a non-employee director receives upon first joining the Company's Board of Directors; and (ii) file a revised version of Exhibit 99.3 (the 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan) reflecting this revision. The other items and exhibits to the Initial Filing further remain unchanged and are not amended hereby.
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
A. . Unchanged from the Initial Filing.
Grant of Stock Options
B. . On March 7, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). The Directors' Plan provides for the automatic grant of stock options to non-employee directors. The Directors' Plan's share reserve and all outstanding stock options granted under the Directors' Plan were automatically adjusted to reflect the Company's stock dividend in August of 2004. However, the number of stock options granted automatically to non-employee directors under the Directors' Plan was not adjusted automatically to reflect the Company's stock dividend. Consequently, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved the adoption of an amendment to the Directors' Plan which increased the number of initial options to be granted to new directors upon first becoming a non-employee director from 20,000 to 40,000 and the number of annual options granted from 10,000 to 18,000. A copy of the amended Directors' Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.

The Participant's Service shall be deemed to have terminated either upon an actual termination of Service or upon the entity for which the Participant performs Service ceasing to be a Participating Company; except that if the entity for which the Participant performs Service is a Subsidiary Corporation and ceases to be a Participating Company as a result of the distribution of the voting stock of such Subsidiary Corporation to the shareholders of the Company or a Parent Corporation, Service shall not be deemed to have terminated as a result of such distribution. Subject to the foregoing, the Company, in its discretion, shall determine whether the Participant's Service has terminated and the effective date of such termination. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Participant's Service shall not be deemed to have terminated merely because the Participating Company for which the Participant renders Service ceases to be a member of the Participating Company Group by reason of a Spinoff Transaction, nor shall Service be deemed to have terminated upon resumption of Service from the Spinoff Company to a Participating Company. For all purposes under this Plan, a Participant's Service shall include Service, whether in the capacity of an Employee, Director or a Consultant, for the Spinoff Company provided a Participant was employed by the Participating Company Group immediately prior to the Spinoff Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company's auditors determine that the provisions or operation of the preceding two sentences would cause the Company to incur a compensation expense and provided further that in the absence of the preceding two sentences no such compensation expense would be incurred, then the two preceding sentences shall be without

Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular.

Any Officer shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Company with respect to any matter, right, obligation, determination or election which is the responsibility of or which is allocated to the Company herein, provided the Officer has actual authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, determination or election. Any decision or determination of the Company made by an Officer having actual authority with respect thereto, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Participating Company Group, any Participant, and all persons having an interest in the Plan, or any Option granted hereunder, unless such Officer's decision or determination is arbitrary or capricious, fraudulent, or made in bad faith. 3.3 POWERS OF THE BOARD. In addition to any other powers set forth in the Plan and subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the full and final power and authority, in its discretion: (a) To construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan and Options granted under it, in its discretion; to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration, and to take all such actions and make all such decisions as may be necessary or
appropriate for the operation and administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, all such decisions and determinations as may be expressly delegated to the Board by the terms of the Plan. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem, in its discretion, necessary, desirable, appropriate or expedient to make the Plan fully effective. (b) To amend the Plan or an Option as provided in Section 11. (c) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary, desirable, appropriate or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company which are not in conflict with the provisions of the Plan. (d) The Board's determination of the construction and interpretation of any provision of the Plan, and any actions taken, and any decisions or determinations made pursuant to the terms of the Plan which are made in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Participating Company Group, any Participant, and any person having an interest in the Plan or any Option granted hereunder. 3.4 POWERS OF THE COMMITTEE. If administration is delegated to the Committee, then the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board (and references in this Plan to the Board shall thereafter be deemed to refer also to such Committee), except as may be expressly limited in the delegation of power or as provided in the next sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the powers of the Committee are limited as follows: (i) construction and interpretation of the Plan by the Committee shall be subject to review by the Board, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, (ii) the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall be complied with at all times, and (iii) the Committee cannot make a discretionary grant under the Plan, nor amend the terms of an automatic grant under the Plan unless such grant would still be exempt from the application of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Board may abolish, or limit the powers of, the Committee at any time and revest in the Board all or some of the administration of the Plan. 3.5 INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or Officers or Employees of the Participating Company Group, members of the Board and any Officers or Employees of the Participating Company Group to whom authority to act for the Board or the Company is delegated shall be indemnified by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall offer to the Company, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same, and to retain complete control over the litigation and/or settlement of such suit, action or proceeding.
3.6 ARBITRATION. Any dispute or claim concerning any Options granted (or not granted) pursuant to this Plan and any other disputes or claims relating to or arising out of the Plan shall be fully, finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Diego, California. By accepting an Option, Participants and the Company waive their respective rights to have any such disputes or claims tried by a judge or jury. 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN. 4.1 MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be Twelve Million Six Hundred Thousand (12,600,000) (after adjustment to reflect the Company's stock dividend on August 13, 2004). The share reserve shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof. However, the share reserve, determined at any time, shall be reduced by the number of shares subject to the Prior Plan Options. If an outstanding Option, including a Prior Plan Option, for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or if shares of Stock are acquired upon the exercise of an Option subject to a Company repurchase option and are repurchased by the Company at the Participant's exercise or purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of such Option or Prior Plan Option or such repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. 4.2 ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares subject to the Plan and in the exercise price per share of any outstanding Options. If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Options are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event, as defined in Section 2.1(u)) shares of another corporation (the "NEW SHARES"), the Board may unilaterally amend the outstanding Options to provide that such Options are exercisable for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise price per share of, the outstanding Options shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Board, in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise price of any Option be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION. Only those persons who, at the time of grant, are serving as Non-Employee Directors shall be eligible to become Participants and to be granted an Option. 6. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS. Options shall be evidenced by Option Agreements specifying, among other things, the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Board shall from time to time
establish. Option Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions: 6.1 AUTOMATIC GRANT. Subject to the execution by a Non-Employee Director of an appropriate Option Agreement, Options shall be granted automatically and without further action of the Board, as follows: (a) INITIAL OPTION PRIOR TO AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director shall be granted an Option to purchase twenty thousand (20,000) shares of Stock (an "INITIAL OPTION") on the date such person first becomes a Non-Employee Director after the Effective Date; provided, however, that an Initial Option shall not be granted to a Director who is an Employee and who subsequently becomes a Non-Employee Director as a result of the termination of his or her status as an Employee. (b) INITIAL OPTION AFTER AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director shall be granted an Initial Option to purchase forty thousand (40,000) shares of Stock on the date such person first becomes a Non-Employee Director after the Amendment Date; provided, however, that an Initial Option shall not be granted to a Director who is an Employee and who subsequently becomes a Non-Employee Director as a result of the termination of his or her status as an Employee. (c) ANNUAL OPTION PRIOR TO AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who previously did not qualify as a Non-Employee Director because of his or her status as an Employee) was granted, prior to the Amendment Date, on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company (an "ANNUAL MEETING") immediately following which such person remains a Non-Employee Director, an Option to purchase ten thousand (10,000) shares of Stock (an "ANNUAL OPTION"); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director granted an Initial Option on, or within a period of 270 days prior to, the date of an Annual Meeting shall not be granted an Annual Option for such Annual Meeting. (d) ANNUAL OPTION AFTER AMENDMENT DATE. Each Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who previously did not qualify as a Non-Employee Director because of his or her status as an Employee) shall be granted, after the Amendment Date, on the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which such person remains a Non-Employee Director, an Annual Option to purchase eighteen thousand (18,000) shares of Stock; provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director granted an Initial Option on, or within a period of 270 days prior to, the date of an Annual Meeting shall not be granted an Annual Option for such Annual Meeting. (e) RIGHT TO DECLINE OPTION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person may elect not to receive an Option pursuant to this Section by delivering written notice of such election to the Board no later than the day prior to the date such Option would otherwise be granted. A person so declining an Option shall receive no payment or other consideration in lieu of such declined Option. A person who has declined an Option may revoke such election by delivering written notice of such revocation to the Board no later than the day prior to the date such Option would be granted pursuant to Section 6.1(a), (b), (c) or (d) as the case may be.
6.2 EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share of Stock subject to an Option shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of the Option. 6.3 EXERCISABILITY AND TERM OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall vest and become exercisable as set forth below and shall terminate and cease to be exercisable on the tenth (10) anniversary date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Plan or the Option Agreement evidencing such Option. (a) INITIAL OPTIONS. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option, each Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable as follows: (i) twenty percent (20%) of the Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the Option, and (ii) 1/60th of the Initial Option shall vest and become exercisable each month, beginning on the date thirteen 13 months after the date of grant of the Option, provided the Participant's Service has not been terminated prior to such date. (b) ANNUAL OPTIONS. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option, each Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable as follows: (i) ten percent (10%) of the Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable on the date six (6) months after the grant of the Option, and (ii) 1/60th of the Annual Option shall vest and become exercisable each month, beginning on the date seven (7) months after the date of grant of the Option, provided the Participant's Service has not terminated prior to such date. 6.4 EARLY EXERCISE. The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionholder may elect at any time while an Employee, Director or Consultant to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Any unvested shares so purchased shall be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company, with the repurchase price to be equal to the original purchase price of the Common Stock, or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate; provided, however, that (i) the right to repurchase at the original purchase price shall lapse at the same rate as the Option vests as described elsewhere in the Plan, and (ii) such right shall be exercisable only within (A) the ninety (90) day period following the termination of the Participant's Service or (B) such longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the Participant. 6.5 PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. (a) FORMS OF CONSIDERATION AUTHORIZED. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i) in cash, by check or cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value not less than the exercise price, (iii) by delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (a "CASHLESS EXERCISE"), (iv) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Board from time to time to the extent permitted by
applicable law, or (v) by any combination thereof. The Board may at any time or from time to time, by approval of or amendment to the standard form of Option Agreement, grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration. (b) LIMITATIONS ON FORMS OF CONSIDERATION. (i) TENDER OF STOCK. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company's stock. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months (and were not used for another Option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company. (ii) CASHLESS EXERCISE. The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise. 6.6 TRANSFERABILITY. An Option shall not be transferable in any manner (including without limitation, sale, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, or assignment) other than, (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) by written designation of a beneficiary, in a form acceptable to the Company, with such designation taking effect upon the death of a Participant, (iii) by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form acceptable to the Company (including such representations, warranties and indemnifications as the Company shall require a Participant to make to protect the Company's interests and ensure that this Option has been transferred under the circumstances approved by the Company), by gift to a Participant's spouse, former spouse, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parent, stepparent, grandparent, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, persons having one of the foregoing types of relationship with a Participant due to adoption, any person sharing a Participant's household (other than a tenant or employee), a foundation in which these persons or the Participant control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests. A transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by these persons (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity is specifically included as a permissible type of transfer. In addition, a transfer to a trust created solely for the benefit (i.e., a Participant and/or any or all of the foregoing persons hold more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest in the trust) of a Participant and/or any or all of the foregoing persons is also a permissible transferee, or (iv) such other transferees as may be authorized by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion. During a Participant's life this Option is exercisable only by the Participant or a transferee satisfying the above conditions. Except in the event of a Participant's death, upon transfer of an Option to any or all of the foregoing persons, the Participant, as the Optionee, is liable for any and all taxes due upon exercise of those transferred Options. At no time will a transferee who is considered an affiliate under Rule 144(a)(1) be able to sell any or all such Stock without complying with Rule 144. The right of a transferee to exercise the transferred portion of this Option shall terminate in
accordance with the Participant' s right of exercise under this Option and is further subject to such representations, warranties and indemnifications from the transferee that the Company requires the transferee to make to protect the Company's interests and ensure that this Option has been transferred under the circumstances approved by the Company. Once a portion of an Option is transferred, no further transfer may be made of that portion of the Option. 6.7 EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE. (a) OPTION EXERCISABILITY. Subject to earlier termination of the Option as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Board in the grant of an Option and set forth in the Option Agreement, an Option shall be exercisable after a Participant's termination of Service only during the applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section and thereafter shall terminate. (i) DISABILITY AND NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If a Participant's Service terminates because of the Participant's Disability or after the Participant reaches Normal Retirement Age, then except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7(a)(ii), (A) the Participant's Service shall be deemed to continue and the exercisability and vesting of the Option and, in the case of an immediately exercisable option, the shares acquired upon exercise thereof shall continue under the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement, and (B) the Option to the extent unexercised and exercisable may be exercised by the Participant (or, the Participant's guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of the Option's term as set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option (the "Option Expiration Date"). (ii) DEATH. If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, or if the Participant dies after attaining Normal Retirement Age, or after the Disability of the Participant then, (A) the exercisability and vesting of the Option and any shares acquired on the exercise thereof shall be accelerated effective as of the date of the Participant's death, and (B) the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date of the Participant's death, may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Participant's death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date of the Participant's death, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. (iii) OTHER TERMINATION OF SERVICE. If the Participant's Service with the Participating Company Group terminates prior to Normal Retirement Age for any reason except Disability, or death, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Participant on the date on which the Participant's Service terminates, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant's Service terminates, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. (b) EXTENSION IF EXERCISE PREVENTED BY LAW. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.7(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section 10 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Participant is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
(c) EXTENSION IF PARTICIPANT SUBJECT TO SECTION 16(B). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.7(a) of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Participant to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which a sale of such shares by the Participant would no longer be subject to such suit, (ii) the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Participant's termination of Service, or (iii) the Option Expiration Date. 7. STANDARD FORMS OF AGREEMENTS. 7.1 OPTION AGREEMENT. Unless otherwise provided by the Board at the time the Option is granted, an Option shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Option Agreement approved by the Board concurrently with its adoption of the Plan and as amended from time to time. 7.2 AUTHORITY TO VARY TERMS. The Board shall have the authority from time to time to vary the terms of any standard form of agreement described in this Section 7 either in connection with the grant or amendment of an individual Option or in connection with the authorization of a new standard form or forms; provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such new, revised or amended standard form or forms of agreement are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. 8. CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event of a Change in Control, any unexercisable or unvested portions of outstanding Options and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof held by Participants whose Service has not terminated prior to such date shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior to the date of the Change in Control. The exercise or vesting of any Option and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof that was permissible solely by reason of this Section shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control. In addition, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or parent corporation thereof, as the case may be (the "ACQUIRING CORPORATION"), may either assume the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially equivalent options for the Acquiring Corporation's stock. Any Options which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the outstanding Options immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 2.1(u)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the outstanding Options shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.
9. TAX WITHHOLDING. 9.1 TAX WITHHOLDING IN GENERAL. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require the Participant, through cash payment or otherwise, including by means of a Cashless Exercise of an Option, to make adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an Option or the shares acquired pursuant thereto. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock or to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Option Agreement until the Participating Company Group's tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant. 9.2 WITHHOLDING IN SHARES. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise of an Option, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates. 10. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAW. The grant of Options and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Options shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities. Options may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Option may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of any Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 11. TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time. However, subject to changes in applicable law, regulations or rules that would permit otherwise, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section 4.2), and (b) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the
Company's stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule. No termination or amendment of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Option unless expressly provided by the Board. In any event, no termination or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Option without the consent of the Participant, unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. 12. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. 12.1 REPURCHASE RIGHTS. Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to a right of first refusal, one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion at the time the Option is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions. 12.2 PROVISION OF INFORMATION. Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company's common stockholders.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Effective as of June 3, 2005, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") appointed Mr. Donald G. Cruickshank to its Board of Directors. In connection with his appointment to the Board, the Company granted Mr. Cruickshank a stock option under the Company's 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Director Plan") to purchase 40,000 shares of Company stock at an exercise price of $38.25 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on June 3, 2005 (the date of grant). The vesting and service requirements for these 40,000 options are identical in all material respects to the terms and conditions of "initial" stock options granted to other new non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors under the Director Plan. In particular, the 40,000 options vest and become exercisable over a five year period in twenty percent increments (twenty percent vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter 1/60th of the total options vest on a monthly basis). A copy of this stock option agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1. This description is a summary of the material terms of the stock option agreement, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual form of stock option agreement which is attached as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
     Mr. Donald Cruickshank (effective as of June 3, 2005) and Dr. Paul E. Jacobs (effective as of June 2, 2005) have been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Cruickshank and Dr. Paul Jacobs were each added to the class of directors whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2008. Other than as set forth herein, there was not and is not any arrangement or understanding between either Mr. Cruickshank or Dr. Paul Jacobs and any other person pursuant to which either Mr. Cruickshank or Dr. Paul Jacobs was selected to be a director. The Board has not yet determined whether to name either Mr. Cruickshank or Dr. Paul Jacobs to any of its committees.
     Mr. Cruickshank brings to the Board his extensive senior management experience in a variety of industries. He has served as director general of the United Kingdom's Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) and chairman of the London Stock Exchange plc. Mr. Cruickshank's career has also included assignments at McKinsey & Co. Inc., Times Newspapers, Virgin Group plc., Wandsworth Health Authority, and the National Health Service in Scotland. In addition, he served as chairman of Action 2000, the United Kingdom's millennium bug campaign. Mr. Cruickshank graduated master of arts from the University of Aberdeen in 1963, became a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1967, and is a graduate of Manchester Business School.
     Dr. Paul Jacobs will become the Company's Chief Executive Officer effective as of July 1, 2005.
     Dr. Paul Jacobs is the son of Dr. Irwin Jacobs, the Chairman of the Board and (until June 30, 2005) Chief Executive Officer of the Company. As described in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on January 14, 2005 (the "Proxy Statement"), Dr. Irwin Jacobs earned $2,763,782 in salary and bonus during the Company's fiscal year ended September 26, 2004 and received a stock option grant for 600,000 shares of the Company's stock at an exercise price of $22.23 per share. Dr. Irwin Jacobs also earned an additional $299,627 in other compensation during fiscal 2004, also as described in the Proxy Statement. Dr. Paul Jacobs' brother Jeffrey A. Jacobs serves as the Company's President, Global Development. Jeffrey A. Jacobs earned $698,094 in salary and bonus during fiscal 2004 and received a stock option grant for 280,000 shares of the Company's stock at an exercise price of $22.23 per share.
     Each of the foregoing family members of Dr. Paul Jacobs under the Company's employ were adults who did not live with Dr. Paul Jacobs. Each such family member is compensated according to standard Company practices, including participation in the Company's employee benefit plans generally made available to employees of a similar responsibility level. The Company does not view Dr. Paul Jacobs as having a beneficial interest in the described transactions with the above family members that is material to them or the Company. Moreover, Dr. Paul Jacobs does not believe that he has a direct or indirect material interest in the employment relationships of the listed family members. Options granted to the family members of Dr. Paul Jacobs described in this Item 5.02 were granted under the Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan and have a grant price that is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. Such options vest according to the following schedule: 10% of the shares subject to the option will vest on the six-month anniversary of the date of grant, with ratable monthly vesting thereafter. Vesting is contingent upon continued service with the Company. Options granted under the Company's Stock Option Plans generally have a maximum term of ten years.

Defined terms not explicitly defined in this Stock Option Agreement but defined in the QUALCOMM Incorporated 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. The details of this Option are as follows: 1. VESTING. Subject to the limitations contained herein, this Option will vest as provided in the Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your Service, unless such termination is due to Disability or death. If termination of Service is due to Disability or death, then the exercisability and vesting of the Option shall continue or accelerate to the extent provided for in the Plan and this Agreement. 2. EXERCISE OF THE OPTION. 2.1 METHOD OF EXERCISE. You may exercise the vested portion of this Option at any time prior to the expiration of the Option by delivering a notice of exercise in such form as may be designated by the Company from time to time together with the exercise price to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other person as the Company may designate, during regular business hours and prior to the expiration of the Option, together with such additional documents as the Company may then require pursuant to the terms of the Plan. 2.2 METHOD OF PAYMENT. Payment of the exercise price may be by cash (or check), or pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which, prior to the issuance of Stock, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to a broker which provides for the payment of the aggregate exercise price to the Company, or a combination of the above methods, as the Company may designate from time to time. 2.3 TAX WITHHOLDING. By exercising this Option you agree that as a condition to any exercise of this Option, the Company may withhold from your pay and any other amounts payable to you, or require you to enter an arrangement providing for the payment by you to the Company of any tax withholding obligation of the Company arising by reason of (1) the exercise of this Option; (2) the lapse of any substantial risk of forfeiture to which the Stock is subject at the time of exercise; or (3) the disposition of Stock acquired upon such exercise. 2.4 RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXERCISE.

In addition, nothing in your Option shall obligate the Company, its stockholders, Board, Officers or Employees to continue any relationship which you might have as a Director or Consultant for the Company. 6.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 20, 2005, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 26, 2005. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial measurements which are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results, and the Company believes that pro forma reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in our industry.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment,to facilitate evaluation of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative view of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial results as though the new method of recording royalties, based solely on reports from licensees, had been in effect for prior periods to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     The attached press release presents pro forma results for fiscal 2005 excluding one-time tax benefits related to fiscal 2004 to provide management, as well as investors, a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1
SAN DIEGO  July 20, 2005  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), a pioneer and innovator of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and other advanced wireless technologies, today announced results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 26, 2005.
Total QUALCOMM Third Quarter Results:
Pro Forma Defined
Consistent with the second quarter of 2005, pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment and one-time tax benefits recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2005, and are presented as if the "New Method" of recording royalties had been in use in the prior year.

QUALCOMM Pro Forma Third Quarter Results:
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at .
www.qualcomm.com
"We are pleased to increase our fiscal year earnings projections, primarily as a result of greater shipments of higher priced WCDMA handsets reflected in our June results. Volume shipments of WCDMA and 1xEV-DO MSMs have increased substantially year-over-year and sequentially, and we look forward to further increases in the quarters ahead. We are projecting continued acceleration in WCDMA and 1xEV-DO shipments toward the end of 2005 and beyond as exciting new handsets in a broad range of price points enable operators to address a larger segment of their subscriber base," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of QUALCOMM.
"QUALCOMM's third generation (3G) products and technologies have helped create a wireless value chain that has grown revenues for QUALCOMM and our partners: wireless content providers, application developers, manufacturers and wireless operators. With the launch of MSM7500, we are providing our partners with an even more powerful hardware platform to build new services that will change the way consumers think about their wireless phone."
"We have increased our research and development investment year-over-year to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the continued and significant transition to 3G. Our efforts have resulted in
 
extensive enhancements to fundamental CDMA performance through the development and use of inventions related to diversity receivers, interference cancellation, equalizers, and multi-carrier radios. In addition, we have continued our long history of innovation by developing compelling new technologies, such as 1xEV-DO Gold Multicast, Platinum Multicast and the FLO air interface, that can greatly improve the efficient use of operators' spectrum and enable multimedia services to be made available to the mass market at affordable prices. QUALCOMM remains focused on bringing new services and features to market through innovation in technologies, products and services, and driving down the costs of this innovation through integration in our chips."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to $7.6 billion on September 26, 2004 and $7.0 billion on June 27, 2004. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we paid cash dividends of $147 million and repurchased shares of stock at a net cost of $723 million.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $259 million in the third fiscal quarter, up 34 percent year-over-year and 3 percent sequentially, largely attributable to increased headcount related to development of integrated circuit products and initiatives to support lower cost solutions, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA. R&D expenses include $13 million attributable to MediaFLO USA in the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, as compared to $7 million in the prior year quarter.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $150 million in the third fiscal quarter, down 4 percent year-over-year and 3 percent sequentially.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate for total QUALCOMM is now estimated to be approximately 22 percent, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 24 percent. The decrease in our estimated annual effective tax rate for total QUALCOMM is primarily the result of
 
our increased ability to use capital loss carryforwards as well as an election to compute our California tax on the basis of our U.S. operations only. Since these benefits were recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 of approximately 18% for total QUALCOMM is lower than the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our fiscal 2005 pro forma effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 28 percent, consistent with our previous estimate. For fiscal 2005 pro forma presentation we excluded $0.01 diluted earnings per share, for the benefit related to the California tax election attributable to fiscal 2004.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI)
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. The third quarter of fiscal 2005 results consisted primarily of a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and $10 million of other income, partially offset by $22 million of operating expenses primarily related to MediaFLO USA and $7 million in equity in losses of investees. Total QUALCOMM results for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 include $0.05 diluted earnings per share for the QSI segment, compared to break-even QSI results in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
A pro forma outlook is provided consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein. Total QUALCOMM outlook for fiscal 2005 is compared to total QUALCOMM results for fiscal 2004 which reflect only partial economic performance of the Company's licensing business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the prospective change to the New Method during that period.
 
Our updated guidance, compared to our prior guidance, reflects an increase in the midpoint of our pro forma earnings per share estimates of $0.02 for fiscal 2005. In addition, we are decreasing the estimate for calendar 2005 handset shipments by approximately 5 percent which is largely attributable to our expectations that the sale of WCDMA handsets in Europe in the second half of the calendar year will be less than previously estimated for the year. Our handset shipment forecast will be discussed in more detail during our third quarter conference call. This call is scheduled for 2:30pm (PDT) on Wednesday July 20, 2005. Refer to conference call dial-in information included at the end of this press release.

QUALCOMM Incorporated () is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2005 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
www.qualcomm.com
Pro forma financial measurements are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results, and the Company believes that pro forma reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in our industry. The Company presents pro forma financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation of its ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative view of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in value of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial results as though the New Method of recording royalties had been in effect for prior periods to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for these periods on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company presents pro forma results for fiscal 2005 excluding one-time tax benefits related to fiscal 2004 to provide management, as well as investors, a clearer understanding of its ongoing tax
 
rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these instruments do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented herein.
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA based networks and CDMA based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA, both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA based products, services or applications; foreign
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; developments in current and future litigation, as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

SAN DIEGO  August 11, 2005  QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and other advanced wireless technologies, today announced that it will acquire Flarion Technologies, a pioneer and leading developer of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA) technology and the inventor of FLASH-OFDM technology for mobile broadband Internet protocol (IP) services. Flarion, with a world-class team and an expansive portfolio of OFDMA intellectual property, has worked closely with several operators worldwide in developing and demonstrating OFDMA technology and products. QUALCOMM will pay approximately $600 million, net of Flarion's projected cash at closing, in QUALCOMM stock and cash, including the assumption of options and warrants at fair value. Upon the satisfaction of certain milestones over the next few years, QUALCOMM may also pay an additional $205 million in the form of cash and QUALCOMM stock. Completion of the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected later this year.
 
"With this acquisition, QUALCOMM will be in a stronger position to support advanced development in both CDMA and OFDMA technologies," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of QUALCOMM. "The combination of Flarion and QUALCOMM's engineering resources greatly strengthens our position as a continued technology innovator and leader in the wireless industry. We believe CDMA will provide the most advanced, spectrally efficient wide area wireless networks for the foreseeable future, but with Flarion we can now more effectively support operators who prefer an OFDMA or hybrid OFDM/CDMA track for differentiating their services."
"This combination with QUALCOMM is ideal for Flarion as QUALCOMM has a proven history of bringing the most advanced technologies to market for large-scale deployments," said Ray Dolan, chairman and CEO of Flarion. "The Flarion team is excited about becoming part of QUALCOMM and working hand in hand to bring the best solutions to the industry."
"The name QUALCOMM is synonymous with excellence," said Rajiv Laroia, founder and CTO of Flarion. "Their CDMA wireless technology is the basis of every major international standard. Both companies value the importance of innovation in solving technical challenges to bring the right solutions to our customers. The two companies have very similar cultures and the combination of the two will be positioned very well with respect to both CDMA and OFDMA wireless technologies."
"With the transition to third-generation CDMA wireless services well underway, CDMA2000 and WCDMA continue to experience substantial growth in markets around the world," said Steve Altman, president of QUALCOMM. "The acquisition of Flarion establishes QUALCOMM as a preeminent developer of emerging OFDMA technologies, enhances our internal OFDMA developments and, when combined with our existing portfolio, results in our owning an industry-leading OFDMA intellectual property portfolio."
QUALCOMM will continue to focus on raising throughput and lowering cost of 3G CDMA networks with advances in receive diversity, interference cancellation, multi-carrier and speech compression. The introduction of VoIP on data-optimized RF carriers and the integration of
 
wireless LAN and multicast technologies, such as OFDM-based FLO (Forward Link Only) technology, provide increased opportunities for operators to deliver voice, data and wireless multimedia applications to their subscribers using various frequency bands and the air interface technologies best suited to the service offering. The addition of Flarion's resources will further strengthen QUALCOMM's position as a leader in designing and licensing OFDMA systems, components and products for operators interested in OFDMA.
Upon the closing of the transaction, of the $600 million, QUALCOMM estimates that it will issue stock with a value of approximately $267 million, assume existing Flarion options and warrants with a fair value of approximately $128 million, and pay approximately $205 million in cash, net of Flarion's projected cash balance. In addition to the initial $600 million, upon the satisfaction of certain milestones prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of the transaction, QUALCOMM is expected to issue approximately $35 million of QUALCOMM stock (a portion of which may not be issued until certain assumed Flarion options and warrants are exercised) and to pay an additional $170 million of cash. QUALCOMM expects approximately $0.03 dilution to pro forma earnings per share in its fiscal year ending September 2006. Additionally, QUALCOMM expects one-time charges of approximately $10 million, principally related to in-process research and development, upon closing. The amounts above are estimates and are subject to change upon closing of the transaction and reaching the identified milestones.
Flarion was advised by Evercore Partners and QUALCOMM was advised by Morgan Stanley.
Headquartered in Bedminster, N.J., Flarion Technologies has developed and deployed FLASH-OFDM mobile broadband since 2000. Flarion's product line consists of the RadioRouter base station, FLASH-OFDM modems, embedded chipsets, and system software to create an end-to-end network for mobile operators (www.flarion.com).
QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the
 
S&P 500 Index and is a 2005 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
Except for the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the Company's ability to successfully design and have manufactured significant quantities of CDMA components on a timely and profitable basis, the extent and speed to which CDMA is deployed, change in economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2004, and most recent Form 10-Q.
In connection with the pending transaction, QUALCOMM will file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 containing an Information Statement for the stockholders of Flarion. Flarion stockholders are urged to read the Registration Statement and the Information Statement when they are available, as well as all other relevant documents filed or to be filed with the SEC, because they contain important information about QUALCOMM, Flarion and the proposed transaction. The final Information Statement will be mailed to stockholders of Flarion after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Flarion stockholders will be able to obtain the Registration Statement, the Information Statement and any other relevant filed documents for free at the SEC's Web site (www.sec.gov).

Table of Contents
Item 8.01. Other Events
     QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") is filing this current report on Form 8-K concurrent with the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 related to its acquisition of Flarion Technologies, Inc. Note 10 in the financial statements contained as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K has been adjusted to reflect the segment reporting structure adopted by the Company in fiscal 2005. No other adjustments or revisions were made to these financial statements.
     In its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended December 26, 2004, the Company adjusted its segment presentation due to changes made to the Company's reporting structure during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company presents the operating results of its wireless multimedia operator subsidiary, MediaFlo USA, Inc., in the QSI segment. The operating expenses related to the wireless multimedia operator business were included in reconciling items through the end of fiscal 2004. Also effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company reorganized a division in the QWI segment that develops and sells test tools to support the design, development, testing and deployment of infrastructure and subscriber products into the QCT segment. The Company has reported its 2005 quarterly results reflecting the reorganized segments and also adjusted the fiscal 2004 quarterly results in the Company's 2005 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
     This current report on Form 8-K includes the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2004 ("the Annual Report"), giving effect to the new segment reporting structure. The Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that is contained in Exhibit 99.1 refers to Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. For ease of reference, the Company is reprinting without revision, the content of Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as Exhibit 99.2 to this current report on Form 8-K.
     The revisions to Note 10 in the financial statements have been made solely to reflect the Company's newly adopted segment reporting structure. The Company has not revised its disclosures, however, to reflect events or occurrences since the date of the Annual Report. Investors should note that the Company continually evaluates its ongoing disclosures for clarity, to facilitate investors' understanding of the Company's business and to ensure that its disclosures reflect managements's view of the Company's business as of the date of its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, although the revisions to the Annual Report present management's view of the Company's business as of the date of the Annual Report, investors should expect future reports and other filings with the SEC to describe the Company's business, operations, products, strategies and the associated risks the Company faces based on its evaluation of those matters as of the date of those subsequent filings.

Exhibit 99.1
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompaning index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on (i) these financial statements and financial statement schedule; (ii) management's assessment; and (iii) the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," during the year ended September 30, 2003.

Note 1. The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies
     
The Company
     QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation, develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on its Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers. The Company grants licenses to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products, and receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications equipment products incorporating its CDMA technologies. The Company provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting services for transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. The Company provides the BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to network operators, handset manufacturers and application developers and support for developing and delivering over-the-air wireless applications and services. The Company also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoptions of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications.
     
Principles of Consolidation
     The Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries controlled by the Company. The ownership of the other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company's foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements one month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
     The Company deconsolidated the Vsper Operating Companies during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of their sale in December 2003 and TowerCo during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of its sale in March 2004 (Note 11). Results of operations and cash flows related to the Vsper Operating Companies and TowerCo are presented as discontinued operations. The Company's statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. The balance sheet as of September 28, 2003 was not adjusted to present assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations separately.
     Effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company adopted the revised interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (FIN 46-R). FIN 46-R requires that certain variable interest entities be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The Company does not have any investments in entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
     
Financial Statement Preparation
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the Company's financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
     
Fiscal Year
     The Company operates and reports using a 52-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 each include 52 weeks. For presentation purposes, the Company presents its fiscal years as ending on September 30.
     
Revenue Recognition
     The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from royalties for its intellectual property, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales, from software development and related services, and from license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each
 
arrangement and the nature of the Company's deliverables and obligations. The development stage of the Company's customers' products do not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.
     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (later revised as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104) which the Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and applied retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company recorded a $147 million loss, net of taxes of $98 million, as the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 to reflect the deferral of revenues and expenses related to future periods. The amortization of revenue that was deferred as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 is expected to continue to be amortized with a declining impact through fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $30 million, $44 million and $66 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in operating income related to revenues and expenses that were recognized in prior years.
     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No. 00-21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" which the Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. Beginning with the adoption of SAB 101 until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recognized revenues and expenses from sales of certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting hardware and related software products by its QWBS division (Note 10) ratably over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the expected messaging service period, which is typically five years. SAB 101 required the ratable recognition of these sales because the messaging service was considered integral to the functionality of the hardware and software. EITF Issue No. 00-21 does not require the deferral of revenue when an undelivered element is considered integral to the functionality of a delivered element and otherwise requires separate unit accounting in multiple element arrangements. Given that the Company meets the criteria stipulated in EITF Issue No. 00-21, the sale of the hardware is accounted for as a unit of accounting separate from the future service to be provided by the Company. Accordingly, the Company began recognizing revenues allocated to the hardware using the residual method, and related expenses from such sales, starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later, instead of amortizing the related revenue over a future period. The Company elected to adopt EITF Issue No. 00-21 prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into after the third quarter of fiscal 2003, rather than reporting the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment. The amortization of QWBS equipment revenue that was deferred in the periods prior to the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will continue with a declining impact through fiscal 2008. QWBS amortized $76 million and $23 million in revenue related to such prior period equipment sales in fiscal 2004 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, respectively. Deferred revenues and expenses related to the historical QWBS sales that will continue to be amortized in future periods were $106 million and $62 million, respectively, at September 30, 2004. Gross margin related to these prior sales is expected to be recognized as follows: $24 million in fiscal 2005, $13 million in fiscal 2006, $6 million in fiscal 2007 and $1 million in fiscal 2008.
     The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne, CDMA2000, 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. Licensees typically pay a nonrefundable license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using the Company's licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. The Company earns royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by its licensees at the time that the licensees' sales occur. The Company's licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were estimated. Royalties for licensees for which the Company had minimal reporting history and certain licensees that did not incorporate the Company's integrated circuit products into their own products were recorded one quarter in arrears, i.e. in the quarter in which the royalties were reported to the Company by those licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues for the Estimated Licensees were based on analyses of the Company's sales of integrated circuits to Estimated Licensees, historical royalty data for Estimated Licensee, an estimate of the time between the Company's
 
sales of integrated circuits to Estimated Licensees and Estimated Licensees' sales of CDMA products, average sales price forecasts, estimates of inventory levels and current market and economic trends. Once royalty reports were received from the Estimated Licensees, the variance between such reports and the estimate was recorded as royalty revenue in the quarter in which the reports were received, i.e. in most cases, the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which the estimated royalties were recorded as revenue.
     The following table summarizes royalty related data for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in millions):
     For example, for fiscal 2003, the Company estimated royalties of $151 million from the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The actual royalties reported to the Company by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $208 million. The variance of $57 million was recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Therefore, total royalty revenues from licensees for fiscal 2004 of $1,141 million included: 1) the prior year fourth quarter variance of $57 million and 2) other royalties reported by licensees during fiscal 2004 of $1,084 million. The Company did not estimate royalty revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to a change in the Company's ability to estimate royalties.
     Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company determined that, due to recent escalating business trends, the Company no longer has the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from certain licensees. These escalating trends include the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Accordingly, the Company did not estimate royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company began recognizing revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalties reported by the Company's licensees were $151 million higher than royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in fiscal 2004 because $151 million in royalties that were reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 had been estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. To facilitate an understanding of the impact of the change, the following table compares royalty revenues recorded as revenue in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 to royalties reported by the Company's licensees during those same periods (in millions):
 
     The table above illustrates that the difference between royalties reported by external licensees and royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations has equaled the difference between the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the current year and the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the prior year.
 
     Revenues from sales of the Company's CDMA-based integrated circuits are recognized at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later. Revenues from providing services are recorded when earned.
     Revenues from long-term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion efforts-expended method of accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of contract profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profit are classified as unearned revenue. Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined. If substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract's duration is relatively short, the Company uses the completed-contract method.
     The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: the written agreement is executed; the software is delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable; collectibility of the license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of multiple-element arrangements, including post-contract customer support. When contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor-specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied, or if the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Judgments and estimates are made in connection with the recognition of software license revenue, which may include assessments of collectibility, the fair value of deliverable elements and the implied support period. The amount or timing of the Company's software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these judgments or estimates.
     The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are estimates, which are based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of the customer agreements.
     Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products and license fees for intellectual property for which delivery is not yet complete and to hardware products sales with a continuing service obligation.
     
Concentrations
     A significant portion of the Company's revenues is concentrated with a limited number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of the Company's QCT, QTL, QWI and other nonreportable segments, comprised 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004, as compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, Kyocera and LG Electronics, customers of the Company's QCT, QTL, QWI and other nonreportable segments, comprised 16%, 14% and 12% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002. Aggregated accounts receivable from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola comprised 51% and 48% of gross accounts receivable at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     Revenues from international customers were approximately 79%, 77% and 69% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     
Cost of equipment and services revenues
     Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily comprised of the cost of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging services revenues and the cost of development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment revenues consists of the cost of equipment sold and sustaining engineering costs, including personnel and related costs. Cost of messaging services revenues consists principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations expenses, including personnel and related costs, depreciation, and airtime charges by telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes personnel costs and related expenses.
 
     
Research and Development
     Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility of the software is established.
     
Shipping and Handling Costs
     Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.
     
Income Taxes
     The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
     
Cash Equivalents
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies' securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
     
Marketable Securities
     Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. The net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The specific identification method is used to compute the realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.
     The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its marketable securities. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the performance of the investee's stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general, analyst recommendations, any news that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates. The Company also reviews the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties and considers new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming that will improve its operating results. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).
     
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
     The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request financial information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g., bank statements) to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
     The Company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of entities it has financed to make required payments. The Company evaluates the adequacy of allowances for doubtful finance and note receivables based on analyses of the financed entities' credit-worthiness, current economic trends or market conditions, review of the entities' current and projected financial and operational information, and
 
consideration of the fair value of collateral to be received, if applicable. From time to time, the Company may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. If the financial condition of the financed entities were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
     
Inventories
     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of committed purchase orders from customers, as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers, among other things.
     
Property, Plant and Equipment
     Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30 years and 15 years, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging from two to 15 years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred.
     Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and the gain or loss is recorded.
     
Other Investments
          
Investments in Other Entities
     The Company makes strategic investments in companies that have developed or are developing innovative wireless data applications and wireless operators that promote the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in corporate entities with less than a 20% voting interest are generally accounted for under the cost method. The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in corporate entities, including limited liability corporations that do not maintain specific ownership accounts, in which it has a voting interest of 20% to 50% and other than minor to 50% ownership interests in partnerships and limited liability corporations that do maintain specific ownership accounts, or in which it otherwise has the ability to exercise significant influence. Under the equity method, the investment is originally recorded at cost and adjusted to recognize the Company's share of net earnings or losses of the investee, limited to the extent of the Company's investment in and advances to the investee and financial guarantees on behalf of the investee that create additional basis.
     The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its investments. When assessing an investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee's latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee's revenue and cost trends, as well as liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate, market acceptance of the investee's products/services as well as any new products or services that may be forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee's competitors and/or industry, and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates. From time to time, the Company may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).
          
Derivatives
     The Company holds warrants to purchase equity interests in certain other companies related to its strategic investment activities. The Company's warrants are not held for trading purposes. Certain of the Company's warrants are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in investment income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments because the warrants do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Warrants that do not have contractual net settlement provisions are recorded at cost.
     The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in investment income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are recorded in
 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects the Company's earnings. The value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts was insignificant at September 30, 2004. The Company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding at September 30, 2004. The Company had no foreign currency forward or option contracts outstanding at September 30, 2003.
     At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the recorded value of the Company's derivative instruments totaled $4 million and $2 million, respectively, and none of the Company's derivatives were designated as hedges. The Company's derivative instruments are included in other assets.
     
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
     Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company fully adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (FAS 141), "Business Combinations," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of FAS 141 (1) require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, (2) provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill, and (3) require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized. FAS 141 also requires that, upon adoption of FAS 142, the Company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill, based on certain criteria. Upon the adoption of FAS 142, the Company reclassified approximately $2 million of certain intangible assets into goodwill.
     FAS 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition. The provisions of FAS 142 (1) prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, (2) require that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested annually for impairment (and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired), (3) require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill, and (4) remove the forty-year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives. The Company completed its transitional testing for goodwill impairment upon adoption of FAS 142 and its annual testing for fiscal 2004 and 2003 and determined that its recorded goodwill was not impaired.
     Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Software development costs are capitalized when a product's technological feasibility has been established through the date a product is available for general release to customers. Software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the software, ranging from less than one year to four years, taking into account such factors as the effects of obsolescence, technological advances and competition. The weighted-average amortization period for capitalized software was one year at both September 30, 2004 and 2003. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, ranging from three to 28 years.
     Weighted-average amortization periods for finite lived intangible assets, by class, were as follows:
     Changes in the weighted-average amortization periods from fiscal 2003 to 2004 resulted from changes associated with additions and dispositions of intangible assets. Dispositions primarily resulted from discontinued operations (Note 11).
 
     The results of operations and earnings per common share for fiscal 2002, assuming FAS 142 had been adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2002, are as follows (in millions, except per share data):
     
Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results.
     
Litigation
     The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The Company estimates the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. The Company records its best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to the Company's pending litigation and revises its estimates.
     
Guarantees and Product Warranties
     In the normal course of business, the Company may provide guarantees to other parties. Upon issuance of a guarantee, the Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee, as required. At September 30, 2004, liabilities related to guarantees were approximately $1 million. At September 30, 2003, liabilities related to guarantees were not significant.
     Estimated future warranty obligations related to certain products are provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The Company establishes a reserve for warranty obligations based on its historical warranty experience. Warranty obligations were $2 million and $4 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and changes in the obligations were not significant during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.
     
Stock-Based Compensation
     The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 (APB 25), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Because the Company establishes the exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the date of grant, the stock options have no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no expense is recorded. Each quarter, the Company reports the potential dilutive impact of stock options in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock method. Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., the average stock price during the period is below the strike price of the stock option) are not included in diluted earnings per common share.
 
     As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 (FAS 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure," the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share have been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions:
     The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. The Black-Scholes model does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in the Company's employee stock options. Use of an option valuation model, as required by FAS 123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and average life of each stock option grant. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the Company's estimate of the fair value of those stock options, in the Company's opinion, existing valuation models, including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single measures and may misstate the fair value of the Company's employee stock options. The Black-Scholes weighted average estimated fair values of stock options granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $13.82, $9.67 and $14.10 per share, respectively. The Black-Scholes weighted average estimated fair values of purchase rights granted pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plans during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $6.24, $4.80 and $7.28 per share, respectively.
     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of stock options is assumed to be amortized to expense over the stock options' vesting periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value method on net income and net earnings per common share for the years ended September 30 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):
     
Foreign Currency
     Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local currency environment use the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated to United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date; revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect at the transaction date. Resulting translation gains or losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income
 
(loss). The functional currency of the Company's foreign investees that do not use local currencies is the United States dollar. Where the United States dollar is the functional currency, the monetary assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses associated with the monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities and related elements of revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at historical rates. Resulting translation gains or losses of these foreign investees are recognized in the statements of operations.
     During fiscal 2004, net foreign currency transaction gains included in the Company's statement of operations were $1 million. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in the Company's statements of operations were insignificant.
     
Comprehensive Income
     Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The Company presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
     The reclassification adjustment for other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities results from the recognition of unrealized losses in the statement of operations due to declines in the market prices of those securities deemed to be other than temporary. The reclassification adjustment for net realized gains results from the recognition of the net realized gains in the statement of operations when the marketable securities are sold.
     Components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following (in millions):
     
Stock Split
     On July 13, 2004, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Stock was distributed on August 13, 2004 to stockholders of record as of July 23, 2004. Stockholders' equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying the par value of the additional shares arising from the split from paid-in-capital to common stock. All references in the financial statements and notes to number of shares and per share amounts reflect the stock split.
     
Earnings Per Common Share
     Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company's stock-based compensation plans and shares subject to written put options, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The incremental dilutive common share equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock method, for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 58,686,000, 56,338,000 and 76,883,000, respectively.
     Employee stock options to purchase approximately 40,221,000, 86,540,000 and 81,690,000 shares of common stock during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on dilutive earnings per common share would have been anti-dilutive. Put options outstanding during fiscal 2004 to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock were not included in the earnings per common share computation for fiscal 2004 because the put options' exercise prices were less than the average market price of the common stock while they were outstanding, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per common share would be anti-dilutive (Note 7).
 
     
Future Accounting Requirements
     In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 02-14, "Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock." EITF Issue No. 02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means. EITF Issue No. 02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-14 are effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company is in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02-14 will have on its financial statements.
     In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for the Company's year ended September 30, 2004. The Company will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF Issue No. 03-1 when final guidance is released.
Note 2. Marketable Securities
     Marketable securities were comprised as follows (in millions):
     As of September 30, 2004, the contractual maturities of debt securities were as follows (in millions):
     Securities with no single maturity date include mortgage- and asset-backed securities.
 
     Available-for-sale securities were comprised as follows at September 30 (in millions):
     The fair values of held-to-maturity debt securities at September 30, 2004 and 2003 approximate cost.
     For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities as follows (in millions):
     The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair values of the Company's investments in individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary for less than 12 months, aggregated by investment category, at September 30, 2004 (in millions):
     At September 30, 2004, the Company did not have any investments in individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary for more than 12 months.
     . The Company's investments in investment grade debt securities consist primarily of investments in certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities and corporate bonds and notes. The unrealized losses on the Company's investments in investment grade debt securities were caused by interest rate increases. Due to the fact that the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September 30, 2004.
Investment Grade Debt Securities
     The Company's investments in non-investment grade debt securities consist primarily of investments in corporate bonds. The unrealized losses on the Company's investment in non-investment grade debt securities were caused by credit quality and industry or company specific events. Because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September 30, 2004.
Non-Investment Grade Debt Securities.
     The Company's investments in marketable equity securities consist primarily of investments in common stock of large companies and equity mutual funds. The unrealized losses on the Company's
Marketable Equity Securities.
 
investment in marketable equity securities were caused by overall equity market volatility and industry specific events. The duration and severity of the unrealized losses in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments were consistent with typical equity market volatility. Current market forecasts support a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the cost of the investment within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September 30, 2004.
Note 3. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions
     
Accounts Receivable
     Unbilled receivables represent costs and profits recorded in excess of amounts billable pursuant to contract provisions and are expected to be realized within one year.
     Net accounts receivable were reduced by $22 million from September 30, 2003 as a result of discontinued operations (Note 11).
     
Finance Receivables
     Finance receivables, which are included in other assets, result from arrangements in which the Company has agreed to provide its customers or certain CDMA customers of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Ericsson) with long-term interest bearing debt financing for the purchase of equipment and/or services. Finance receivables were comprised as follows:
     At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of finance receivables approximated $2 million and $198 million, respectively. The fair value of finance receivables is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar financing would be provided to similar customers for the same remaining maturities.
     The Company had various financing arrangements, including a bridge loan facility, an equipment loan facility, and interim and additional interim loan facilities, with Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V., a CDMA wireless operator in Mexico (collectively referred to as Pegaso). On September 10, 2002, Telefnica Mviles (Telefnica) acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso. On October 10, 2002, Pegaso paid $82 million in full satisfaction of the interim and additional interim loans. On November 8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435 million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility. The Company used approximately $139 million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by Pegaso to other lenders. On June 13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281 million of the equipment loan facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain terms of the equipment loan facility. On December 15, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $193 million, including accrued interest, in full satisfaction of the equipment loan facility. The Company recognized
 
$12 million, $41 million and $9 million in interest income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including $10 million and $23 million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of the prepayments in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     A long-term financing commitment for $346 million under an arrangement with Ericsson expired on November 6, 2003. At September 30, 2004, the Company has a remaining commitment to extend up to $118 million in long-term financing to certain CDMA customers of Ericsson. The funding of this commitment, if it occurs, is not subject to a fixed expiration date and is subject to the CDMA customers meeting conditions prescribed in the financing arrangement and, in certain cases, to Ericsson also financing a portion of such sales and services. Financing under this arrangement is generally collateralized by the related equipment. The commitment represents the maximum amount to be financed; actual financing may be in lesser amounts.
     
Inventories
     Inventories were reduced by $8 million from September 30, 2003 as a result of discontinued operations (Note 11).
     
Property, Plant and Equipment
     Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $133 million, $117 million and $93 million, respectively. The gross and net carrying values of property, plant and equipment were reduced by $170 million and $103 million, respectively, from September 30, 2003 as a result of discontinued operations (Note 11).
     At September 30, 2004 and 2003, buildings and improvements and leasehold improvements with a net book value of $38 million and $66 million, respectively, including accumulated depreciation and amortization of $27 million and $52 million, respectively, were leased to third parties or held for lease to third parties. Future minimum rental income on facilities leased to others in each of the next five years from fiscal 2005 to 2009 are $10 million, $9 million, $9 million, $7 million and $1 million, respectively.
     
Intangible Assets
     Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization (Note 1). The Company's reportable segment assets do not include goodwill (Note 10). The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for annual testing purposes. Goodwill was allocable to reporting units included in the Company's reportable
 
segments at September 30, 2004 as follows: $268 million in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, $73 million in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and $15 million in QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet.
     The components of purchased intangible assets, which are included in other assets, were as follows (in millions):
     The gross carrying values of wireless licenses, customer-related intangible assets and marketing-related intangible assets were reduced by $105 million, $5 million and $1 million, respectively, from September 30, 2003 as a result of discontinued operations (Note 11). During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a $34 million impairment loss in its QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives segment on its wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets' carrying values and their estimated fair values.
     All of the Company's purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are subject to amortization. Amortization expense from continuing operations for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $17 million, $18 million and $14 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to these intangible assets is expected to be $14 million in fiscal 2005, $14 million in fiscal 2006, $13 million in fiscal 2007, $9 million in fiscal 2008 and $8 million in fiscal 2009.
     Capitalized software development costs, which are included in other assets, were $44 million and $36 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization on capitalized software was $39 million and $26 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization expense from continuing operations related to capitalized software for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $13 million, $12 million and $10 million, respectively.
Note 4. Investments in Other Entities
     
Inquam Limited
     The Company has invested $200 million in the convertible preferred shares of Inquam Limited (Inquam) for an approximate 42% ownership interest in Inquam. Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless communications systems, either directly or indirectly, with the intent of deploying CDMA-based technology, primarily in Europe. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company and another investor (the Other Investor) also extended $117 million in bridge loan financings to Inquam, including $31 million in bridge loan funding put in place during fiscal 2004. The Company funded its approximate $58 million share of these bridge loans and had no remaining funding commitment at September 30, 2004. Inquam is a variable interest entity. The Company does not consolidate Inquam because it is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in Inquam. The Company recorded $59 million, $99 million and $45 million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company's equity and debt investments in Inquam totaled $42 million and $68 million, net of equity in losses, respectively. The carrying amount of the Company's investment in Inquam exceeded its underlying equity in the net assets of Inquam by $8 million and $9 million, at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     On September 22, 2003, the Company agreed, along with the Other Investor, to guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit agreement. During fiscal 2004, the Company and the Other Investor agreed to extend the guarantee and increase the maximum amount subject to the guarantee to $55 million. The Company's maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an amount equal to 50% of the amounts outstanding under Inquam's credit agreement, up to a maximum of approximately $28 million. Amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement totaled $53 million as of September 30, 2004. The guarantee expires on November 30, 2004 when the bank credit facility matures. Inquam is currently working with the bank and other potential lenders to
 
secure long-term "take out" financing to repay the existing loan on the maturity date. It is possible that the Company and the Other Investor may provide additional guarantees in connection with such take out financing.
     During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company and the Other Investor committed to fund an additional $2 million each. While the Company has no other obligations to provide funding to Inquam, the Company continues to have active discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the necessary funding for all or a part of Inquam's business plan, potential restructuring and investment by other parties. While the Company may provide some additional funding and/or credit support in furtherance of Inquam's business plan, the amount and form of such support is unknown, and none will be provided without commensurate support or consideration being provided by the Other Investor.
     Inquam's summarized financial information, derived from its unaudited financial statements, is as follows (in millions):
     
Other
     Other strategic equity investments as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled $123 million and $87 million, respectively, including $50 million and $33 million, respectively, accounted for using the cost method. Differences between the carrying amounts of certain other strategic equity method investments and the Company's underlying equity in the net assets of those investees, consisting of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets accounted for in accordance with FAS 142, were not significant at September 30, 2004 and 2003. At September 30, 2004, effective ownership interests in these investees ranged from less than 1% to 50%.
     Summarized financial information regarding the Company's principal equity method investments, excluding Inquam, derived from their unaudited financial statements, follows. These investments are primarily noncontrolling interests in early stage companies and venture funds. Information is presented in the aggregate, and net loss is generally presented from the acquisition date (in millions):
 
     Funding commitments related to these investments total $19 million at September 30, 2004, which the Company expects to fund through fiscal 2009. Such commitments are subject to the investees meeting certain conditions; actual equity funding may be in lesser amounts. An investee's failure to successfully develop and provide competitive products and services due to lack of financing, market demand or an unfavorable economic environment could adversely affect the value of the Company's investment in the investee. There can be no assurance that the investees will be successful in their efforts.
Note 5. Investment Income (Expense)
     Investment income (expense) for the years ended September 30 was comprised as follows (in millions):
 
* As adjusted (Note 11).
     During fiscal 2004 and 2003, management determined that declines in the market value of the Company's investment in Korea Telecom Freetel Co., Ltd. (KTF), a wireless operator in South Korea, were other than temporary. In reaching this conclusion, the decline in stock value as a percentage of the original cost and the length of time in which the market value of the investment had been below its original cost were considered. As a result, the Company recorded $10 million and $81 million in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company holds 4,416,000 common shares of KTF as of September 30, 2004. The fair value of the common shares was $72 million at September 30, 2004.
     During fiscal 2002, management determined that declines in the market values of the Company's investments in Leap Wireless International, Inc. (Leap Wireless) were other than temporary when those values declined significantly due to unfavorable business developments. Subsequently, Leap Wireless filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2003. The Company recorded $180 million in other-than-temporary losses on
 
marketable securities related to its debt and equity investments in Leap Wireless during fiscal 2002. The Company also recorded $59 million in losses related to changes in the fair values of Leap Wireless derivative instruments for fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, Leap Wireless emerged from bankruptcy. As a result, the Company received a distribution comprised of $19 million in cash and $16 million in equity in Leap Wireless in exchange for its debt investments, and the Company recorded $34 million in net realized gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2004. The Company's equity and derivative instruments in Leap Wireless were cancelled without consideration. The fair value of the Company's new equity investment in Leap Wireless was $14 million at September 30, 2004.
Note 6. Income Taxes
     The components of the income tax provision for the years ended September 30 were as follows (in millions):
     The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended September 30 were as follows (in millions):
     The following is a reconciliation of the expected statutory federal income tax provision to the Company's actual income tax provision for the years ended September 30 (in millions):
     The Company did not provide for United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of approximately $1.5 billion of undistributed earnings from certain non-United States subsidiaries permanently invested outside the United States. Should the Company repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings. The Company is currently studying the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions enacted on October 22, 2004, as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate future earnings of some of its foreign subsidiaries. However, the decision to repatriate would relate solely to future earnings to be generated after the date such decision was made.
 
     At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net deferred tax assets as follows (in millions):
     Gross deferred tax assets and valuation allowance each decreased by $495 million from September 30, 2003, primarily as a result of discontinued operations (Note 11), with no net effect on net deferred tax assets.
     The Company reversed approximately $1.1 billion of its valuation allowance on substantially all of its United States deferred tax assets during fiscal 2003 as a credit to stockholders' equity. The Company believes it, more likely than not, will have sufficient taxable income after stock option related deductions to utilize its net deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2004, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on net capital losses in the amount of $139 million. This valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Company's ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses.
     At September 30, 2004, the Company had unused federal and state income tax credits of $658 million and $78 million, respectively, generally expiring from 2005 through 2024. The Company does not expect these credits to expire unused.
     Cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $127 million, $125 million and $89 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The income taxes paid primarily relate to foreign withholding taxes.
Note 7. Capital Stock
     
Preferred Stock
     The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution of preferred share purchase rights, 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and reserved such shares for issuance upon exercise of the preferred share purchase rights. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
     
Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan
     The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan) to protect stockholders' rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. Under the Rights Plan, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company's common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-hundredth share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $250. In November 1999, the Rights Plan was amended to provide that the purchase price be set at $400. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. Upon exercise, holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to receive the Company's common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value, as defined, equal to twice such
 
purchase price. The Rights, which expire on September 25, 2005, are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company's option at any time for a price of $0.005 per Right.
     
Stock Repurchase Program
     On February 10, 2003, the Company authorized the expenditure of up to $1 billion to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. During fiscal 2003, the Company bought 9,830,000 shares at a net aggregate cost of $158 million. While the Company did not repurchase any of the Company's common stock under this program during fiscal 2004, the Company continues to evaluate repurchases under this program. At September 30, 2004, $834 million remains authorized for repurchases under the program. Repurchased shares are retired upon repurchase.
     In connection with the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options under three separate contracts with independent third parties during fiscal 2004 that may have required the Company to purchase 3,000,000 shares of its common stock upon exercise. The Company accounted for the written put options in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." In the event the put options were exercised, the contracts required that the options be physically settled in cash. The Company determined that the put options should be classified as liabilities in accordance with FAS 150. As such, the Company recorded the $5 million in premiums received as additions to other current liabilities, and changes in the fair values of the put options were recognized in the Company's statement of operations. The Company repurchased all of the put options during fiscal 2004. The net gain recorded in investment income related to the put options, including premiums received, during fiscal 2004 was $5 million.
     During fiscal 2003, the Company sold put options under three separate contracts with independent third parties that required the Company to purchase 3,000,000 shares of its common stock upon exercise. All of these put options expired unexercised. The Company classified the put options as permanent equity in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-19, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock," which was subsequently amended by FAS 150. As such, the Company recorded the $7 million in premiums received as paid-in capital.
     
Dividends
     On February 11, 2003, the Company announced its first common stock dividend of $0.025 per share. On July 16, 2003, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.025 to $0.035 per share on common stock. On March 2, 2004, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.035 to $0.050 per share on common stock. On July 13, 2004, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.050 to $0.070 per share on common stock. Cash dividends announced in fiscal 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):
Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans
     
Employee Savings and Retirement Plan
     The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible employees to contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make additional contributions based upon earnings. The Company's contribution expense for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $21 million, $20 million and $20 million, respectively.
     
Stock Option Plans
     The Company may grant options to selected employees, directors and consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
 
The 2001 Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Plan) was adopted and replaced the 1991 Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan), which expired in August 2001. Options granted under the 1991 Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The shares reserved under the 2001 Plan were equal to the number of shares available for future grant under the 1991 Plan on the date the 2001 Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. At that date, approximately 101,083,000 shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Plan. In fiscal 2004, the Company reserved another 64,000,000 shares for future grants under the 2001 Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001 Plan at any time. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding six years and are exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. At September 30, 2004, options for approximately 120,860,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices ranging from $1.40 to $86.19 per share for an aggregate exercise price of $2.1 billion.
     The Company has adopted the 2001 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors' Plan), which replaced the 1998 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Directors' Plan). Options granted under the 1998 Directors' Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The shares reserved under the 2001 Directors' Plan are equal to the number of shares available for future grant under the 1998 Directors' Plan on the date the 2001 Directors' Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. At that date, 4,100,000 shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Directors' Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001 Directors' Plan at any time. This plan provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee directors at fair market value, vesting over periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. At September 30, 2004, options for approximately 3,232,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices ranging from $2.91 to $66.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price of $30 million.
     A summary of stock option transactions for the plans follows (number of shares in thousands):
 
     Information about fixed stock options outstanding at September 30, 2004 follows (number of shares in thousands):
     There were approximately 129,990,000 options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $13.42 per share at September 30, 2003. There were approximately 137,876,000 options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $8.97 per share at September 30, 2002.
     Information about stock options outstanding at September 30, 2004 with exercise prices less than or above $38.25 per share, the closing price at September 30, 2004, follows (number of shares in thousands):
     
Employee Stock Purchase Plans
     The Company has two employee stock purchase plans for all eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize the Company to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any offering period, subject to certain limitations. The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to approximately 24,309,000 shares to be granted. The 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to 400,000 shares to be granted. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, shares totaling approximately 2,205,000, 2,744,000 and 2,300,000 were issued under the plans at an average price of $18.60, $13.20 and $15.73 per share, respectively. At September 30, 2004, approximately 17,232,000 shares were reserved for future issuance.
     
Executive Retirement Plans
     The Company has voluntary retirement plans that allow eligible executives to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis, the Company matches up to 10% of the participants' deferral in Company common stock based on the then-current market price, to be distributed to the participant upon eligible retirement. The income deferred and the Company match held in trust are unsecured and subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company. Company contributions begin vesting based on certain minimum participation or service requirements, and are fully vested at age 65. Participants who terminate employment forfeit their unvested shares. All shares forfeited are used to reduce the Company's future matching contributions. The plans authorize up to 1,600,000 shares to be allocated to participants at any time. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately
 
108,000, 89,000 and 88,000 shares, respectively, were allocated under the plans. The Company recorded $5 million, $2 million and $2 million in compensation expense during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to its net matching contributions to the plans. At September 30, 2004, approximately 331,000 shares were reserved for future allocation.

Litigation
     : In fiscal 2001, 87 former QUALCOMM employees filed a lawsuit against the Company in the District Court for Boulder County, Colorado, alleging claims for intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and concealment, violation of C.R.S. Section 8-2-104 (obtaining workers by misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation of California Labor Code Section 970, violation of California Civil Code Sections 1709-1710, rescission, violation of California Business & Professions Code Section 17200 and violation of California Civil Code Section 1575. The complaint seeks economic, emotional distress and punitive damages and unspecified amounts of interest. On November 29, 2001, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss 17 of the plaintiffs from the lawsuit. Subsequently, the Court dismissed three other plaintiffs from the lawsuit. On November 18, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss 61 of the remaining 67 plaintiffs from the lawsuit. The Company subsequently resolved the matters with the remaining plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed have appealed. Oral argument on the appeal occurred on October 26, 2004, and no decision has been received.
Schwartz, et al v. QUALCOMM
     : These cases, the first of which was filed in fiscal 2001, were filed in San Diego County Superior Court by over 100 former employees, alleging claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract, intentional/negligent fraud, concealment, rescission, specific performance, work, labor and services, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of California Business & Professions Code Section 17200 and unjust enrichment, claiming that they were entitled to full vesting of unvested stock options as a result of the sale of the Company's infrastructure business to Ericsson in 1999. The Company has answered the complaints, which have been consolidated, and discovery is ongoing. On July 16, 2004, the Court granted the Company's summary adjudication motion, dismissing plaintiffs' breach of contract claims.
Hanig et al. v. QUALCOMM, Boesel, et al v. QUALCOMM, Stone v. QUALCOMM, Ortiz et al v. QUALCOMM, Shannon et al. v. QUALCOMM, Deshon et al v. QUALCOMM, Earnhart et al. v. QUALCOMM
     : On February 2, 2000, three former QUALCOMM employees filed a putative class action against the Company, ostensibly on behalf of themselves and those former employees of the Company whose employment was terminated in April 1999. Virtually all of the purported class of plaintiffs received severance packages at the time of the termination of their employment, in exchange for a release of claims, other than federal age discrimination claims, against the Company. The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles and purports to state 10 causes of action including breach of contract, age discrimination, violation of Labor Code Section 200, violation of Labor Code Section 970, unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory relief and undue influence. The complaint seeks an order accelerating all unvested stock options for the members of the class, plus economic and liquidated damages of an unspecified amount. On June 27, 2000, the case was ordered transferred from Los Angeles County Superior Court to San Diego County Superior Court. On July 3, 2000, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and discovery commenced. On May 29, 2001, the Court dismissed all plaintiffs' claims except for claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. On July 16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class certification on the remaining claims, to be revisited by the Court at the end of the discovery period. On April 15, 2003, the Court granted the Company's summary judgment motions as to all remaining class members' disparate impact claims. On June 18, 2003, the Court ordered decertification of the class and dismissed the remaining claims of the opt-in plaintiffs without prejudice. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal. On June 20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed an action in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their layoffs in 1999. To date, the complaint has not been served.
Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM
     : On March 30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. (Zoltar) filed suit against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a QUALCOMM wholly-owned subsidiary, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging infringement of three patents. On August 27, 2001, Zoltar filed an
Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM, Inc. and SnapTrack, Inc.
 
amended complaint adding Sprint Corp. as a named defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack. Since then, Zoltar has dismissed Sprint Corp. as a defendant. Trial of this matter commenced on February 24, 2004. On March 25, 2004, the jury reached a unanimous verdict of no infringement in favor of the Company and SnapTrack on six of the seven patent claims asserted by Zoltar. On July 26, 2004, the Court found no infringement on the remaining patent claim asserted by Zoltar and entered a judgment in favor of the Company and SnapTrack on Zoltar's complaint and awarded the Company and SnapTrack their costs of suit. Zoltar has noticed an appeal and the Company and SnapTrack have filed a responsive notice.
     On July 25, 2003, the Company filed an action in Delaware Superior Court against Texas Instruments Incorporated for breach of a patent portfolio license agreement between the parties, seeking damages and other relief. On September 23, 2003, Texas Instruments filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against the Company alleging breach of the same agreement, seeking damages and other relief. The Company has since dismissed its case in Superior Court and refiled its claims as part of the action in the Chancery Court. In a written order dated July 14, 2004, the Court granted QUALCOMM's summary judgment motion, dismissing all of Texas Instruments' claims against QUALCOMM. In addition, the Court ruled that Texas Instruments had breached the patent portfolio license agreement, though the breach was non-material, and therefore Texas Instruments' license under the agreement would not be forfeited. The Court held a one-day bench trial on August 16, 2004, on the Company's claim that Texas Instruments breached the agreement between the parties by pursuing the claims previously dismissed by the Court. Although the Court had already found that the claims brought by Texas Instruments were barred by the agreement, the Court declined to find that bringing the claims constituted a breach of the agreement by Texas Instruments and, therefore, found against the Company on the sole remaining claim in the case. On October 22, 2004, the Company filed a notice of appeal.
Texas Instruments Incorporated v. QUALCOMM Incorporated:
     : On October 8, 2002, the Company filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Conexant and Skyworks alleging infringement of five patents and misappropriation of trade secrets and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December 4, 2003, Skyworks answered and counterclaimed against QUALCOMM, alleging infringement of four patents and misappropriation of trade secrets and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On April 30, 2004, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss defendants' inequitable conduct affirmative defenses and counterclaims. The Company filed an amended complaint on June 16, 2004, bringing the total number of the Company's patents at issue to eight and maintaining the trade secret misappropriation claim. On July 16 and 20, 2004, Conexant and Skyworks answered the Company's amended complaint, reasserted claims based on alleged trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement and Skyworks also asserted counterclaims alleging violations of antitrust laws and unfair business practices. Conexant and Skyworks seek damages and other forms of relief. On September 21, 2004, the Company moved to stay the Skyworks antitrust and related counterclaims. That motion is pending. The Company believes the counterclaims are without merit. Claim construction hearings relating to the patents in the case are under way. Discovery in the matter is continuing.
QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Conexant Systems, Inc. and Skyworks Solutions Inc.
     On December 2, 2002, the Company filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) alleging infringement of three patents and seeking damages and injunctive relief. The Company has since amended the complaint, bringing the total number of patents at issue to four. On May 5, 2004, the Court granted Maxim's motion that no indirect infringement arose in connection with defendants' sales of certain products to certain licensees of the Company. On June 21, 2004, the Court granted the Company's motion to stay all of Maxim's antitrust counterclaims and its patent misuse defense. On July 9, 2004, Maxim filed an Answer and Counterclaims to the Company's Third Amended Complaint. Maxim's amended counterclaims allege violation of antitrust laws and unfair business practices and seek damages and other relief. The Company believes the amended counterclaims are without merit and, if and when the Court's stay is lifted, the Company will seek dismissal of those counterclaims as a matter of law. Claim construction hearings relating to the patents in the case are under way. Discovery in the matter is continuing.
QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.:
     The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless phones, wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action lawsuits (In re Wireless Telephone Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States District Court for the District of Maryland), and in several individually filed actions, seeking personal injury, economic and/or punitive damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. On March 5, 2003, the Court granted the defendants motions to dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian, Farina and Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal law. On April 2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this order and the Court's order
Other:
 
denying remand. All remaining cases filed against the Company allege personal injury as a result of their use of a wireless telephone. Those cases have been remanded to the Washington, D.C. Superior Court. The courts that have reviewed similar claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs' claims in those cases.
     Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the actions. The Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the legal proceedings described above based on the Company's belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position.
     
Operating Leases
     The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases, with terms ranging from 2 to 10 years and with provisions for cost-of-living increases. Rental expense for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $31 million, $34 million and $42 million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments in each of the next five years from fiscal 2005 through 2009 are $45 million, $32 million, $20 million, $7 million and $4 million, respectively, and $3 million thereafter.
     
Purchase Obligations
     The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets and estimates its noncancelable obligations under these agreements to be approximately $885 million in fiscal 2005, $58 million in fiscal 2006, $2 million in fiscal 2007, $2 million in fiscal 2008 and $2 million in fiscal 2009. Of these amounts, commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories comprised $717 million in fiscal 2005 and $39 million in fiscal 2006.
     
Letters of Credit and Other Financial Commitments
     In addition to the financing commitments to Ericsson (Note 3) and the Inquam guarantee commitment (Note 4), the Company had $1 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2004, none of which were collateralized.
Note 10. Segment Information
     The Company is organized on the basis of products and services. The Company aggregates three of its divisions into the QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segment. Reportable segments are as follows:
 
     As a result of the disposition of the remaining operations and assets related to the Vsper Operating Companies and TowerCo (Note 11), consolidated investees of QSI, the Company determined that the results of operations related to the Vsper Operating Companies and TowerCo should be presented as discontinued operations. QSI revenues and EBT for all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of revenues and EBT related to these consolidated investees to discontinued operations.
     During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its wholly-owned subsidiary SnapTrack, a developer of wireless position location technology. The Company previously presented all of the revenues and operating results of SnapTrack in the QCT segment. As a result of the reorganization of SnapTrack, revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's server software business (software for computer servers that allows operators to offer location-based services and applications) became part of the QIS division in the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack's client business (the gpsOne hybrid assisted global positioning system wireless location technology that is embedded with the integrated circuit products) remain with the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation.
     Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company presents the operating results of its wireless multimedia operator subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc., in the QSI segment. The development expenses related to the wireless multimedia operator business were included in reconciling items through the end of fiscal 2004. Also effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company presents the revenues and operating results of a QWI division that develops and sells test tools to support the design, development, testing and deployment of infrastructure and subscriber products into the QCT segment. Prior period information below has been adjusted to conform to the fiscal 2005 segment presentation.
     The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT) from continuing operations, excluding certain impairment and other charges that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes. EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Segment data includes intersegment revenues. All segment data in the tables below are reclassified for the changes discussed above.
     The table below presents revenues, EBT and total assets for reportable segments (in millions):
 
     QSI assets included $106 million, $116 million and $203 million related to investments in equity method investees at September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
     Revenues from each of the Company's divisions aggregated into the QWI reportable segment for the years ended September 30 were as follows (in millions):
 
     Other reconciling items for the years ended September 30 were comprised as follows (in millions):
 
     Generally, revenues between segments are based on prevailing market rates for substantially similar products and services or an approximation thereof. Certain charges are allocated to the corporate functional department in the Company's management reports based on the decision that those charges should not be used to evaluate the segments' operating performance. Unallocated charges include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, research and development expenses and marketing expenses related to the development of the CDMA market that were not deemed to be directly related to the businesses of the segments.
     Specified items included in segment EBT for years ended September 30 were as follows (in millions):
 
 
     Effectively all equity in losses of investees (Note 5) were recorded in QSI in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. Effectively all interest expense (Note 5) was recorded as corporate expense in reconciling items in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.
     The Company distinguishes revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. Sales information by geographic area for the years ended September 30 was as follows (in millions):
 
* As adjusted (Note 11).
     Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable, finance receivables and inventory for QCT, QTL and QWI. The QSI segment assets include marketable securities, accounts receivable, finance receivables, notes receivable, other investments and assets of consolidated investees. The QSI segment assets at September 30, 2003 and 2002 included $265 million and $391 million, respectively, in assets related to discontinued operations (Note 11). Total segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of unallocated corporate assets primarily comprised of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, property, plant and equipment, and goodwill. The net book value of long-lived assets located outside of the United States was $21 million, $117 million and $251 million at September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were primarily in Brazil at September 20, 2003 and 2002 related to discontinued operations (Note 11).
Note 11. Discontinued Operations in the QSI Segment
     In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired ownership interests in Vsper So Paulo S.A. and Vsper S.A. (the Vsper Operating Companies). The Vsper Operating Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide fixed wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern, northeast and eastern regions of Brazil and in the state of So Paulo. In November 2001, the Company consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial restructuring of the Vsper Operating Companies, which resulted in its holding direct and indirect controlling ownership interests in the Vsper Operating Companies. As a result, the Vsper Operating Companies were consolidated in the Company's QSI segment.
     On December 2, 2003 (the Closing Date), Embratel Participaes S.A. (Embratel) acquired the Company's direct and indirect ownership interests in the Vsper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction) for no consideration. The Vsper Operating Companies' existing communication towers and related interests in tower site property leases (Vsper Towers) were not included in the Embratel sale transaction, and as such, the Company effectively retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary (TowerCo), ownership and control of the Vsper Towers. The Vsper Towers had a net book value of approximately $5 million on the Closing Date. Concurrent with the closing, the Vsper Operating Companies entered into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the Vsper Operating Companies' option for up to two successive 5-year terms) whereby the Vsper Operating Companies would pay a monthly fee to the Company for use of aerial and ground space on the tower sites. The Company provided approximately $6 million to fund operations of the Vsper Operating Companies during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 prior to their sale and additionally provided approximately $39 million in aggregate funding to or for the benefit of the Vsper Operating Companies on or before the Closing Date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. Such funding enabled the Vsper Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt (at an agreed discount) to allow the Company to retain ownership of the Vsper Towers free and clear of any local bank security interest. The major classes of assets and liabilities sold in the Embratel sale transaction included: $25 million in accounts receivable, $5 million in inventory, $24 million in other current assets, $95 million in property, plant and equipment, $6 million in other assets, $52 million in accounts payable, $5 million in payroll and other benefits related liabilities, $6 million in unearned revenue, $1 million in other current liabilities, $14 million in long-term debt and $3 million in other liabilities. The Company realized a net loss of $52 million on the Embratel sale transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, including a $74 million loss on the net assets sold to Embratel and
 
a $46 million loss related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in stockholders' equity, partially offset by $68 million in gains related to the extinguishment of local bank debt and the settlement of other liabilities.
     On November 19, 2002, the Company won bids to acquire personal mobile service (SMP) licenses in certain regions of Brazil. Approximately $8 million of the approximate $82 million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in December 2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated obligation was financed by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment for inflation. These SMP licenses were not included in the Embratel sale transaction. In December 2003, the Company initiated a waiver and return of the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. In February 2004, the waiver and return of the SMP licenses was approved by Anatel, and the license debt was extinguished. The Company realized a net gain of $19 million as a result of the removal of the $104 million SMP licenses and the related $123 million debt and accrued interest during the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
     On March 2, 2004, the Company sold TowerCo to Embratel in a separately negotiated transaction (the TowerCo sale transaction) for $45 million in cash. TowerCo's assets were primarily comprised of $5 million in property, plant and equipment. The Company realized a net gain of $40 million on the TowerCo sale transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of the disposition of the remaining operations and assets related to the Vsper Operating Companies, the Company determined that the results of operations and cash flows related to the Vsper Operating Companies, including the results related to TowerCo and the SMP licenses and the gains and losses realized on the Embratel and TowerCo sales transactions, should be presented as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The Company's statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. At September 30, 2004, the Company had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the Vsper Operating Companies, TowerCo or the SMP licenses recorded on its consolidated balance sheet.
     Revenues of $36 million, $123 million and $125 million were reported in the loss from discontinued operations during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pro forma results for fiscal 2002, assuming the acquisition of the Vsper Operating Companies had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2002, are not presented because they would not differ materially from reported results.
Note 12. Auction Discount Voucher
     The Company was awarded a $125 million Auction Discount Voucher (ADV) by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 2000 as the result of a legal ruling. The ADV is fully transferable and may, subject to certain conditions, be used in whole or in part by any entity in any FCC spectrum auction over a period of three years, including those in which the Company is not a participant. During November 2002, the FCC amended the terms of the ADV to allow the Company to use the ADV to satisfy existing FCC debt of other companies. The FCC agreed to extend the ADV twice, most recently in June 2004. The ADV was scheduled to expire in September 2004, but the Company used the remaining ADV prior to its expiration.
     The Company used approximately $77 million of the ADV's value prior to fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $4 million in other operating income and $4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the QSI segment for cooperative marketing expenses incurred, with no effect on net income, related to an arrangement under which a portion of the ADV was transferred to a wireless operator prior to fiscal 2004.
     During fiscal 2004, the Company transferred approximately $18 million of the ADV's value to a wireless operator for approximately $17 million in cash. As a result of this transfer, the Company recorded an additional $17 million in other operating income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2004. The Company recorded $47 million in other income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2003 related to transfers of the ADV's value to wireless operators.
     The Company also used approximately $30 million of the ADV during fiscal 2004 as final payment for wireless licenses granted in fiscal 2004 in which the Company was the highest bidder in a FCC auction held during fiscal 2003. On a cumulative basis, the Company used $38 million of the ADV as payment for these wireless licenses, for which the Company had no cost basis at September 30, 2004. The ADV had no remaining value at September 30, 2004.
Note 13. Subsequent Events
     In October 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximate 86% of the outstanding capital stock of Iridigm Display Corporation, a privately held display technology company, that it did not already own for approximately $160 million in cash and the exchange of stock options with an aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $17 million. Also in October 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Trigenix Limited, a privately held mobile user interface company, for approximately $33 million in cash.

Exhibit 99.2

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 26, 2005, upon the unanimous recommendation of the QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") Governance Committee, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company unanimously approved, and the Company entered into, an amendment and restatement of the Rights Agreement (the "Agreement," as amended and restated the "Amended and Restated Agreement") dated September 26, 1995 between the Company and Computershare Investor Services LLC (successor in interest to First Interstate Bank of California). The principal purpose of the amendment and restatement of the Agreement was to extend its term through September 25, 2015. In addition to its extension, the Company also made certain additional amendments in the Amended and Restated Agreement, including the following:
The foregoing summary is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Item 3.03 Material Modification of Rights of Securityholders.
See Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Amended and Restated Agreement modifies the Rights as described in Item 1.01.
Item 5.03 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
See Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Agreement and the resulting modification of the Rights, on September 26, 2005 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") to its Certificate of Designation setting forth the rights of the Company's Series A Stock. The Certificate of Designation was set forth as Attachment 1 to the Company's Restated Certificate filed with the Delaware Secretary of State March 9, 2005. The Certificate of Amendment increased the number of shares designated as Series A Stock from 1,500,000 to 4,000,000 and made other changes to the rights thereof corresponding with revisions made to the Amended and Restated Agreement. Specifically, the rights of the Series A Stock previously expressed as being one-hundred times the rights of the Common Stock (rights with respect to dividends, distributions, voting rights and rights upon liquidation) were adjusted to be one thousand times the rights of the Common Stock to correspond with the change in the Rights to purchase one one-thousandth of one share of Series A Stock in lieu of one one-hundredth of such a share. The foregoing summary is qualified by reference to the Certificate of Amendment, which is included as an exhibit to the Amended and Restated Agreement and is also filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto.

     WHEREAS, on September 26, 1995, the Company and the Rights Agent entered into the Original Agreement;
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company previously authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right (a ) for each Common Share (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding at the close of business on October 16, 1995 (the ), with each Right initially representing the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (as hereinafter defined) upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized and directed the issuance of one Right with respect to each Common Share that has become and shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined) pursuant to the Original Agreement and this Agreement;
"Right"
"Record Date"
     WHEREAS, the Original Agreement expires by its terms on the close of business on September 26, 2005 (the );
"Original Final Expiration Date"
     WHEREAS, after thorough and careful consideration, including the consultation with its advisors and such other inquiries as the Board of Directors has deemed appropriate, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders to amend and restate the Original Agreement to extend the Original Final Expiration Date to the Final Expiration Date set forth herein so as to continue the benefits of the Original Agreement beyond the Original Final Expiration Date, to adjust the Purchase Price for the Rights, to make each Right represent the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share and to make such other changes to the Original Agreement as the Board of Directors otherwise deems advisable; and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Rights Agent desire to amend and restate the Original Agreement in its entirety to give effect to the foregoing changes to the terms and provisions of the Original Agreement, all as set forth in this Agreement.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof. Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.
          (c) Certificates for Common Shares which become outstanding (including, without limitation, reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph (c)) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:
 
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain rights as set forth in the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement between QUALCOMM Incorporated and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, dated as of September 26, 2005, as amended from time to time (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of QUALCOMM Incorporated. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. QUALCOMM Incorporated will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. As described in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued to or beneficially owned by any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall become null and void and may not thereafter be exercised or transferred.
With respect to such certificates or book entry credits containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates or book entry credits shall be evidenced by such certificates or book entry credits alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate or book entry credit shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Shares shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.
     . The Right Certificates (and the form of election to purchase Preferred Shares, the form of assignment and the form of certification to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit B to this Amended and Restated Agreement and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Sections 11 and 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share as shall be set forth therein at the price per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share set forth therein (the ), but the number of such one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.
Section 4. Form of Right Certificates
"Purchase Price"
     . The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its Chief Financial Officer, or any of its Vice Presidents, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Section 5. Countersignature and Registration
 
Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such person was not such an officer.
     Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its office designated for such purpose, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.
     . Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, at any time after the close of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
Section 6. Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates
     Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will issue, execute and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for countersignature and delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

          (c) Upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof by certified check, cashier's check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any transfer agent for the Preferred Shares certificates for the number of Preferred Shares to be purchased and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests, or (B) requisition from the depositary agent depositary receipts representing such number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share as are to be purchased (in which case certificates for the Preferred Shares represented by such receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary agent) and the Company hereby directs the depositary agent to comply with such request, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate.
          (d) In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise fewer than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
          (e) The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Preferred Shares or any Preferred Shares held in its treasury, the number of Preferred Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights in accordance with this Section 7.
 
          (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certification following the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Rights Certificate surrendered for such exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

     . Each person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Shares or other securities is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Preferred Shares or other securities represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered with the forms of election and certification duly executed and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Shares or other securities transfer books of the Company are closed, such

          (a) (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Preferred Shares into a smaller number of Preferred Shares or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Company were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
provided, however,
               (ii) Subject to Section 24 of this Agreement, in the event any Person shall become an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right shall, for a period of 60 days after the expiration or termination of the redemption option set forth in Section 23(b) (provided that, if at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the Rights there shall be a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, an injunction, or temporary suspension by the Board of Directors, or similar obstacle to exercise of the Rights (the ) which prevents exercise of the Rights, a new 60-day period shall commence on the date the Injunction is removed), have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Amended and Restated Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of Common Shares of the Company as shall equal the result obtained by (A) multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number of one one-
"Injunction"
 
thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Company's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date such Person became an Acquiring Person; that if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is also subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii). In the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person and the Rights shall then be outstanding, the Company shall not take any action which would eliminate or diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
provided, however,
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights beneficially owned by (i) such Acquiring Person or an Associate or Affiliate of such Acquiring Person, (ii) a transferee of such Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person became such, or (iii) a transferee of such Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person's becoming such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in such Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this Section 11(a)(ii), shall become null and void without any further action and no holder of such Rights shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights, whether under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to insure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder. No Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate; and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be canceled.
               (iii) In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exercise of the Rights. In the event that the Company shall, after a good faith effort, be unable to take all such action as may be necessary to authorize such additional Common Shares, the Company shall substitute, for each Common Share that would otherwise be issuable upon exercise of a Right, a number of Preferred Shares or fraction thereof such that the current per share market price of one Preferred Share multiplied by such number or fraction thereof is equal to the current per share market price of one Common Share as of the date of issuance of such Preferred Shares or fraction thereof; that if the Company is further unable to cause the authorization of a sufficient number of Preferred Shares, then, in the event the Rights become so exercisable, the Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, with respect to each Right
provided, however,
 
(A) pay cash in an amount equal to the Purchase Price, in lieu of issuing Common Shares and requiring payment therefor, or (B) issue debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, having a value equal to the Current Value of the Common Shares (as defined hereinafter), where the value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, and require the payment of the Purchase Price, or (C) deliver any combination of cash, property, Common Shares, Preferred Shares and/or other securities having a value equal to the Current Value, and require payment of all or any requisite portions of the Purchase Price. The Current Value shall be the product of the current market price per share of Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described above in subparagraph (ii)) multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Right otherwise would be exercisable if there were sufficient shares available. To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second sentence of this subparagraph (iii), the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to 45 days following the date on which the event described in Section 11(a)(ii) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended.
          (b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares (or shares having the same designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Preferred Shares ("equivalent preferred shares")) or securities convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares at a price per Preferred Share or equivalent preferred share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares) less than the then current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Preferred Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market price and the denominator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
provided, however,
 
          (c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Preferred Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Preferred Share and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Preferred Shares; that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
provided, however,
          (d) (i) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of any security (a for the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (C) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or as reported on the Nasdaq National Market or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System () or such other system then in

provided, however,
"Nasdaq"
 
use, or, if on any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.
"Trading Day"
               (ii) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Shares are not publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Shares as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement) multiplied by one thousand. If neither the Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or so listed or traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
          (e) No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one one-millionth of a Preferred Share or one ten-thousandth of any other share or security as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the date of the expiration of the right to exercise any Rights.
provided, however,
          (f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than Preferred Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Shares contained in Section 11(a) through (c), inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Preferred Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
          (g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
 
          (h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share (calculated to the nearest one one-millionth of a Preferred Share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
          (i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
          (j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
          (k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below one one-thousandth of the then par value, if any, of the Preferred Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Preferred Shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
 
          (l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the Preferred Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
provided, however,
          (m) Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Shares, issuance wholly for cash of any Preferred Shares at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Shares, dividends on Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), made after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement by the Company to holders of its Preferred Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
          (n) In the event that at any time after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in any such case (A) the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share purchasable after such event upon proper exercise of each Right shall be determined by multiplying the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share so purchasable immediately prior to such event by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and (B) each Common Share outstanding immediately after such event shall have issued with respect to it that number of Rights which each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to such event had issued with respect to it. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be made successively whenever such a dividend is declared or paid or such a subdivision, combination or consolidation is effected.
     . Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares or the Preferred Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

     .
Section 13. Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power
          (a) In the event that, following the Shares Acquisition Date, directly or indirectly (x) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person, (y) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or merge with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger (other than, in the case of either transaction described in (x) or (y), a merger or consolidation which would result in all of the Voting Power represented by the securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into securities of the surviving entity) all of the Voting Power represented by the securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and the holders of such securities not having changed as a result of such merger or consolidation), or (z) the Company shall sell, mortgage or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its subsidiaries shall sell, mortgage or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that (i) following the Distribution Date, each holder of a Right, subject to Section 7(e), shall have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable in accordance with the terms of this Amended and Restated Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of shares of freely tradeable Common Shares of the Principal Party (as hereinafter defined), free and clear of liens, rights of call or first refusal, encumbrances or other adverse claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by (A) multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable (without taking into account any adjustment previously made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) and dividing that product by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Common Shares of such Principal Party (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (ii) such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) the term shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party, it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section 11 hereof shall apply to such Principal Party; and (iv) such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of shares of its Common Shares in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights.
"Company"
          (b) shall mean:
"Principal Party"
               (i) in the case of any transaction described in (x) or (y) of the first sentence of Section 13(a), the Person that is the issuer of any securities into which Common Shares of the Company are converted in such merger or consolidation, and if no securities are so issued, the Person that is the other party to the merger or consolidation (including, if applicable, the Company, if it is the surviving corporation); and
 
               (ii) in the case of any transaction described in (z) of the first sentence in Section 13(a), the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions;
that in any case, (1) if the Common Shares of such Person are not at such time and have not been continuously over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and such Person is a direct or indirect subsidiary or Affiliate of another Person the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person; (2) in case such Person is a subsidiary, directly or indirectly, or Affiliate of more than one Person, the Common Shares of two or more of which are and have been so registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of the Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value; and (3) in case such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Person, the rules set forth in (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the chains of ownership having an interest in such joint venture as if such party were a "subsidiary" of both or all of such joint venturers and the Principal Parties in each such chain shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as their direct or indirect interests in such Person bear to the total of such interests.
provided, however,
          (c) The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless the Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of authorized shares of its Common Shares that have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and each Principal Party and each other Person who may become a Principal Party as a result of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing for the terms set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 13 and further providing that, as soon as practicable after the date of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets mentioned in paragraph (a) of this Section 13, the Principal Party at its own expense will:
               (i) prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ) with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Act) until the Final Expiration Date;
"Act"
               (ii) use its best efforts to qualify or register the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights under the blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as may be necessary or appropriate; and
               (iii) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for the Principal Party and each of its Affiliates which comply in all material respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 under the Exchange Act.
The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other transfers.
 
          (d) After the Shares Acquisition Date, the Company covenants and agrees that it shall not (i) consolidate with, (ii) merge with or into, or (iii) sell or transfer to, in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, any other Person, if at the time of or after such consolidation, merger or sale there are any charter or bylaw provisions or any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding, agreements in effect or any other action taken which would diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger or sale unless prior thereto the Company and such other Person shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement evidencing compliance with this subsection.
     .
Section 14. Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
          (a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or as reported on the Nasdaq National Market or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.
          (b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share). Fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts; that holders of such depositary receipts shall have all of the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time
provided, however,
 
such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be the closing price of a Preferred Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
          (c) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).
     . All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Sections 18 and 20 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares) and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to, this Agreement. Holders of Rights shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by them in any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, however, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or administrative agent or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligations; provided however, that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to have any such injunction, order, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as promptly as practicable.
Section 15. Rights of Action
     . Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:
Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders
          (a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares;
          (b) after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal office of the Rights Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and
 
          (c) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     . No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Shares or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section 17. Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder
     . The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability in the premises. The indemnity provided herein shall survive the expiration of the Rights and the termination of this Agreement.
Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent
     The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of this Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate for the Preferred Shares or Common Shares or for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper person or persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 20 hereof. In no event will the Rights Agent be liable for special, indirect, incidental or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damage.
     . Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation
Section 19. Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent
 
succeeding to the shareholder services or corporate trust business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
     In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
     . The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Section 20. Duties of Rights Agent
          (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel of its choice (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
          (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
          (c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
          (d) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
 
          (e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Section 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a certificate pursuant to Section 12 describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
          (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
          (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, any Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent with respect to its duties or obligations under this Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or omitted and the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified therein (which date shall not be less than three business days after the date indicated in such application unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking or omitting any such action, the Rights Agent has received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
          (h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
 
          (i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
          (j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
          (k) If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has not been executed, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise of transfer without first consulting with the Company.
     . The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent for the Common Shares or Preferred Shares by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent for the Common Shares or Preferred Shares by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any other state of the United States which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $25 million. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent for the Common Shares or Preferred Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 21. Change of Rights Agent
 
     . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 22. Issuance of New Right Certificates
     .
Section 23. Redemption and Annual Independent Director Evaluation
          (a) The Rights may be redeemed by action of the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 23 and shall not be redeemed in any other manner.
          (b) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the Shares Acquisition Date; or (ii) the Final Expiration Date, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the ), and the Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in Common Shares (based on the "current per share market price," as defined in Section 11(d) hereof, of the Common Shares at the time of redemption), cash or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. The redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and subject to such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof prior to the expiration or termination of the Company's right of redemption hereunder.
"Redemption Price"
          (c) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 23, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after such action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to subsection (b) the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.
provided, however,
 
          (d) The Company may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to the Rights by (i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the Rights and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares, and upon such action, all outstanding Right Certificates shall be null and void without any further action by the Company.
          (e) A committee of the Company's Board of Directors shall review this Agreement in order to consider whether the maintenance of this Agreement continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such committee shall conduct such review at least annually, when, and in such manner as the committee deems appropriate, after giving due regard to all relevant circumstances. Following each such review, such committee will report its conclusions to the full Board of Directors, including any recommendation in light thereof as to whether this Agreement should be modified or the Rights should be redeemed. Such committee shall be comprised only of directors of the Company who shall have been determined by the Company's Board of Directors to be independent under Nasdaq listing standards, or, if the Common Shares are listed on a national exchange, such national exchange's listing standards. Such committee is authorized to retain such legal counsel, financial advisors and other advisors as the committee deems appropriate in order to assist the committee in carrying out its foregoing responsibilities under this Agreement. Such committee shall initially be the Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, provided that the Board of Directors may from time to time designate the committee responsible for such review.
     .
Section 24. Exchange
          (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
"Exchange Ratio"
          (b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
 
The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
provided, however,
          (c) In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights. In the event that the Company shall, after a good faith effort, be unable to take all such action as may be necessary to authorize such additional Common Shares, the Company shall substitute, for each Common Share that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of Preferred Shares or fraction thereof such that the current per share market price of one Preferred Share multiplied by such number or fraction thereof is equal to the current per share market price of one Common Share as of the date of issuance of such Preferred Shares or fraction thereof; that if the Company is further unable to cause the authorization of a sufficient number of additional Common Shares, then, in the event the Rights become so exchangeable, the Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, with respect to each Right (A) pay cash in an amount equal to the current per share market price of one Common Share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described in Section 11(a)(ii)) in exchange for each Right, in lieu of issuing Common Shares, or (B) issue debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, having a value equal to the current per share market price of one Common Share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described in Section 11(a)(ii)) where the value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, in exchange for each Right, or (C) deliver any combination of cash, property, Common Shares and/or other securities having a value equal to the current per share market price of one Common Share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described in Section 11(a)(ii)) in exchange for each Right. To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 24(c), the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to 45 days following the date on which the event described in Section 11(a)(ii) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended.
provided, however,
 
          (d) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this subsection (d), the current market value of a whole Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately after the date of the first public announcement by the Company that an exchange is to be effected pursuant to this Section 24.
          (e) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share) upon exchange of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share). Fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts; that holders of such depositary receipts shall have all of the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share. For the purposes of this Section 24(e), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be the closing price of a Preferred Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately after the date of the first public announcement by the Company that an exchange is to be effected pursuant to this Section 24.
provided, however,
     .
Section 25. Notice of Certain Events
          (a) In case the Company shall propose (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Preferred Shares (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Preferred Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Preferred Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Preferred Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any other Person, (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or (vi) to declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or to effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Shares), then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purpose of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares and/or the Preferred Shares, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Preferred Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares and/or the Preferred Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.
 
          (b) In case the event set forth in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall occur, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe the event and the consequences of the event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.
     . Notices or demands authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by the holder of any Right Certificate to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the Rights Agent) as follows:
Section 26. Notices
Subject to the provisions of Section 21 hereof, any notice or demand authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Company or by the holder of any Right Certificate to or on the Rights Agent shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the Company) as follows:
Notices or demands authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Company or the Rights Agent to the holder of any Right Certificate shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such holder at the address of such holder as shown on the registry books of the Company.
     . The Company may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to the Rights which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, any such supplement or amendment to be evidenced by a writing signed by the Company and the Rights Agent; that from and after such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, this Agreement shall not be amended in any manner which would adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person amend this Agreement to (a) lower the thresholds set forth in Sections 1(a) and 3(a) hereof from 15% to any percentage
Section 27. Supplements and Amendments
provided, however,
 
which is (i) greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known by the Company to be beneficially owned by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) and (ii) not less than 10% or (b) increase the Purchase Price for each one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share provided above in Section 7(b). Upon delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of this Section 27, the Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment unless the Rights Agent shall have determined in good faith that such supplement or amendment would adversely affect its interest under this Agreement. Prior to the Distribution Date, the interests of the holders of Rights shall be deemed coincident with the interests of the holders of Common Shares.
     . For all purposes of this Agreement, any calculation of the number of Common Shares outstanding at any particular time, including for purposes of determining the particular percentage of such outstanding Common Shares or any other securities of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the exclusive power and authority to administer this Agreement and to exercise all rights and powers specifically granted to the Board, or the Company, or as may be necessary or advisable in the administration of this Agreement, including without limitation, the right and power to (i) interpret the provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Agreement (including a determination to redeem or not redeem the Rights or to amend the Agreement). All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations (including, for purposes of clause (y) below, all omissions with respect to the foregoing) which are done or made by the Board in good faith, shall (x) be final, conclusive and binding on the Rights Agent and the holders of the Right Certificates, and (y) not subject the Board to any liability to the holders of the Right Certificates.
Section 28. Determination and Actions by the Board of Directors, etc
     . All the covenants and provisions of this Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Rights Agent shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns hereunder.

In Witness Whereof
 
Exhibit A
          QUALCOMM Incorporated, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, does hereby certify:
           No shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation have, as of the date of this Certificate, been issued.
FIRST:
           A resolution providing for amendments to the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation September 26, 2005, which resolution provides as follows:
SECOND:
          , that, pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the designation and terms of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation established pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 1995 and incorporated into Attachment 1 to the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State March 10, 2005, shall be amended in their entirety to read as follows:
"RESOLVED
               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
               SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT. Four Million (4,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, $.0001 par value, are designated "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" with the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions specified herein (the "Junior Preferred Stock").
 
Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Junior Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Junior Preferred Stock.
               SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
               (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Junior Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of April, July, October and January in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 26, 2005 (the "Designation Date") declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Junior Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
               (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Junior Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
               SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
               (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Junior Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
               (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Junior Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
               SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
               (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Junior Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
                    (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock;
                    (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
                    (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock; or
                    (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Junior Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Junior Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
               (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
               SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of Junior Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may by reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
 
               SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Junior Preferred stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION. The shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
               SECTION 9. RANK. The Junior Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.
 
               SECTION 10. AMENDMENT. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Junior Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class."
 
               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Designation has been executed by its duly authorized officer this 26th day of September, 2005.

Exhibit C
     On September 26, 1995, the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend was effective as of October 16, 1995 (the "Record Date") with respect to the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights also attach to new Common Shares issued after the Record Date. The terms of the Rights were set forth in the Rights Agreement between the Company and First Interstate Bank of California dated September 26, 1995 (the "Original Rights Agreement"). On September 26, 2005, the Company's Board amended and restated the Original Rights Agreement by entering into the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Rights Agreement") between the Company and Computershare Investor Services LLC (successor to First Interstate Bank of California as the "Rights Agent" under the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement). The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement extends the term of the Rights and makes certain other changes to the Rights, such that the terms of the Rights are as summarized below. This summary description of the Rights is not intended to be complete, however, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
     Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $180.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. Each Preferred Share is designed to be the economic equivalent of 1,000 Common Shares. The complete description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement.
Detachment and Transfer of Rights
     Initially, the Rights are evidenced by the stock certificates representing Common Shares outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates have been distributed. Until the earlier to occur of (i) a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (ii) the business day following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Share certificate with a copy of this Summary of Rights attached thereto.
     The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights) the surrender or transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of
 
the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
Exercisability of Rights
     The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on September 25, 2015 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, in each case as described below. Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
     The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of each Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Shares or a stock dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Shares occurring, in any such case, after the execution of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional Preferred Shares will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
Terms of Preferred Shares
     Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per Common Share. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per Common Share. Each Preferred Share will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per Common Share. These rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Because of the nature of the Preferred Shares' dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one Common Share. The Preferred Shares would rank junior to any other series of the Company's preferred stock.
 
Trigger of Flip-In and Flip-Over Rights
     In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
     In the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
Redemption, Independent Director Evaluation and Exchange of Rights
     At any time prior to the earliest of (i) the close of business on the day of the first public announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person, or (ii) the final Expiration Date, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
     A committee of the Company's Board of Directors is required to, at least annually, determine whether maintenance of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders or whether the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement should be modified or the Rights redeemed. The reviewing committee is to be comprised only of independent directors.
     At any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share, or one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share (or of a share of a class or series of the Company's preferred stock having equivalent designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions), per Right (subject to adjustment).
Amendment of Rights
     The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights, including an amendment (a) to lower certain thresholds described above to any percentage which is (i) greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known to the Company to be beneficially owned by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of
 
the Company, employee benefit plans of any Company or any Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares pursuant to the terms of any such plan) and (ii) not less than 10% or (b) increase the Purchase Price for each Right, except that from and after such time as the person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.

EXHIBIT 99.2
          QUALCOMM Incorporated, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, does hereby certify:
           No shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation have, as of the date of this Certificate, been issued.
FIRST:
           A resolution providing for amendments to the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation September 26, 2005, which resolution provides as follows:
SECOND:
          ", that, pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the designation and terms of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation established pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 1995 and incorporated into Attachment 1 to the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State March 10, 2005, shall be amended in their entirety to read as follows:
RESOLVED
               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
               SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT. Four Million (4,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, $.0001 par value, are designated "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" with the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions specified herein (the "Junior Preferred Stock"). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors;
 
provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Junior Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Junior Preferred Stock.
               SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
               (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Junior Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of April, July, October and January in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 26, 2005 (the "Designation Date") declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Junior Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
               (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Junior Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
               SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
               (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Junior Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
               (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Junior Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
               SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
               (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Junior Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
                    (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock;
                    (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
                    (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock; or
                    (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Junior Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Junior Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
               (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
               SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of Junior Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may by reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
 
               SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Junior Preferred stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION. The shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
               SECTION 9. RANK. The Junior Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.
 
               SECTION 10. AMENDMENT. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Junior Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class."
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Designation has been executed by its duly authorized officer this 26th day of September, 2005.

This plan, amended and restated on October 21, 2005 as the Voluntary Executive Retirement Contribution Plan, provides that eligible participants, including selected management employees and non-employee directors, may elect to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation (including director retainers and meeting fees) otherwise owed to the individual to a future date selected by the participant or in connection with a change in control, the participant's disability or the participant's termination of service.
     Amounts credited to participants' accounts include gains or losses attributable to the deemed investment in one or more deemed investment options offered by the Company. The amounts credited to a participant's account under the plan represent an obligation of the Company to make payments to the participant at some time in the future.

               6.3.1.2 In quarterly or annual installment payments of substantially equal amounts over a period as provided below:
               6.3.1.3 A Participant may amend his or her Election to take a distribution based on Retirement, Disability or any In-Service Distribution from a single lump sum to installments by filing an amended Election at least twelve (12) months in advance of the date that the first distribution specified in the original Election being amended. The amended new distribution date must be in a Plan Year five (5) years after the year of the first distribution specified in the original Election.

               6.3.1.4 The Participant's method of distribution selected in his or her Election shall remain in effect for all future similar deferrals until changed or revoked by the Participant during a subsequent Open Enrollment Period. The Participant's method of distribution may be revoked or changed only during an Open Enrollment Period and such revocation or change may be prospective only.
          6.3.2 . If, at the time of his or her Distribution Date, a Participant has failed to elect a form of distribution or who elects an installment distribution does not satisfy the requirements for the installment term elected, then such Participant's Benefits shall be distributed either (i) in a single lump sum payment (if no form selected) or (ii) in the case of installments, over the longest installment term for which the Participant is qualified on his or her Distribution Date.
Failure to Specify a Form of Distribution or Failure to Qualify for Installment Term Elected
          6.3.3 . For purposes of this Section 6.3, installment distributions shall be paid in substantially equal quarterly or annual payments under an installment methodology established by the Committee.
Installment Amounts
          6.3.4 .

               6.4.1.2 The In-Service Distribution Date for any Deferral Subaccount must be at least two (2) years after the end of the Plan Year for which Deferrals to such Subaccount are made.
               6.4.1.3 Benefits shall be paid (or payments shall commence) on the In-Service Distribution Date.
          6.4.2 . A Participant who has elected an In-Service Distribution Date may revoke and/or amend the In-Service Distribution Date Election by filing a revocation or an amended Election at least twelve (12) months in advance of the In-Service Distribution Date specified in the Election being revoked or amended. The amended In-Service Distribution Date must be in a Plan Year five (5) years after the In-Service Distribution Date specified in the prior Election or at termination of employment. If a Participant revokes an In-Service Distribution Date Election and does not provide another In-Service Distribution Date, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have the Benefit distributed at termination of employment, provided that in no event shall a distribution commence prior to the date five (5) years after the date of the revocation of such earlier election. An In-Service Distribution Date Election for any Deferral Subaccount may be amended only once. Nothing in this Section 6.4.2 shall preclude a Participant from amending his or her Election as to the method of distribution in accordance with Section 6.3.1.3, above.
Revocation or Amendment of Election
          6.4.3 . If the Participant terminates employment with the Employer before his In-Service Distribution Date for any reason (other than Retirement or Disability, to the extent of a valid Retirement or Disability Election), distribution of the Participant's Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the date of such Participant's termination of employment and such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment.
Termination Before the Planned Distribution Date
          6.4.4 . Notwithstanding any prior Election, if the Participant terminates employment with the Employer for any reason (other than Retirement or Disability, to the extent of a valid Retirement or Disability Election) while receiving installment In-Service Distributions, distribution of the Participant's remaining installments shall be made in a single lump sum payment as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant's termination of employment.
Termination After Commencement of Installment In-Service Distributions
 
          6.4.5 . If a Participant does not elect an In-Service Distribution Date in his or her initial Election, or if the Participant revokes an In-Service Distribution Date Election, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to have the Benefits credited to the relevant Subaccount distributed upon his or her termination of employment.
Absence of In-Service Distribution Election
     6.5 . If a Participant dies before his or her Benefit payments have commenced, then such Participant's Benefits shall be paid to his or her designated Beneficiary in a single lump sum cash distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the Committee is notified of the Participant's death and receives evidence satisfactory to it thereof. If a Participant dies after his or her Benefit distribution has commenced, his or her remaining Benefits shall be paid to the deceased Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum cash distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the Committee is notified of the Participant's death and receives evidence satisfactory to it thereof.
Distribution Upon Death of Participant
     6.6 . If a Participant's Service terminates due to Retirement or a Participant suffers a Disability before or after his or her Benefit payments have commenced, then such Participant's Benefits shall be paid in the optional form of distribution previously selected as soon as administratively feasible after the Committee is notified of the Participant's Retirement or Disability and receives evidence satisfactory to it thereof.
Distribution Upon Retirement or Disability of Participant
     6.7 . In the event of a distribution to a Specified Employee based upon such individual's termination of Service with the Employer, no distributions will be made, irrespective of any Election to the contrary, before the date which is six (6) months after the date of termination of Service, or if earlier the date of the death of the Specified Employee.
Specified Employees
     6.8 .

Any amount which is not distributed to the Participant in a Plan Year as a result of this limitation shall be distributed to the Participant in the next Plan Year, subject to compliance with the foregoing limitations set forth in this Section 6.8.
Limitation on Distributions to Covered Employees
     6.9 . Distribution and withdrawal payments under this Article VI shall be subject to all applicable withholding requirements for state and federal income taxes and to any other federal, state or local taxes that may be applicable to such payments.
Tax Withholding

Designation of Beneficiary
     7.2 . If, upon the death of the Participant, there is no valid Beneficiary designation, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's surviving spouse. In the event there is no surviving spouse, then the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
No Designated Beneficiary

Deferrals Transferred to the Trust

Source of Benefit Payments
     8.3 . The Benchmark Funds established pursuant to Section 5.3 shall be for the sole purpose of determining the Investment Return to be used for determining the Investment Return credited to the Participant's Account. Neither the Trustee nor the Committee shall have any obligation to invest the Participants' Account in accordance with his deemed investment directions or in any other investment.
Investment Discretion
     8.4 . Except as otherwise provided by the Trust Agreement, the assets of the Trust, shall be subject to the claims of creditors of the Employer. Except as provided in the Trust Agreement, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary) shall be a general unsecured creditor of the Employer with respect to the payment of Benefits under this Plan.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.1, the Plan may be amended by the Committee or the Company, by action of its Board, at any time, retroactively if required, if found necessary, in the opinion of the Committee or the Board, in order to ensure that the Plan is characterized as a "top-hat" plan of deferred compensation maintained for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as described under ERISA sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1), and to conform the Plan to the provisions and requirements of any applicable law (including specifically Section 409A of the Code, and other applicable portions of ERISA and the Code). No such amendment shall be considered prejudicial to any interest of a Participant hereunder.
Amendments to Ensure Proper Characterization of Plan
     10.3. The Plan and any Election may also be amended as provided in this Section 10.3.
Changes in Law Affecting Taxation of Participants
          10.3.1 . This Section 10.3 shall become operative upon the enactment of any change in applicable statutory law or the promulgation by the IRS of a final regulation or other pronouncement having the force of law, which statutory law, as changed, or final regulation or pronouncement, as promulgated, would cause any Participant to include in his or her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Participant under the Plan on a date (an "Early Taxation Event") prior to the date on which such amounts are made available to him or her hereunder.
Operation
          10.3.2 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary (but subject to Section 10.3.3 below), as of an Early Taxation Event, the feature or features of this Plan that would cause the Early Taxation Event shall be null and void, to the extent, and only to the extent, required to prevent the Participant from being required to include in his or her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Participant under the Plan prior to the date on which such amounts are made available to him or her hereunder. If only a portion of a Participant's Account is impacted by the change in the law, then only such portion shall be subject to this Section 10.3, with the remainder of the Account not so affected being subject to such rights and features as if the law were not changed. If the law only impacts Participants who have a certain status with respect to the Employer, then only such Participants shall be subject to this Section 10.3.
Affected Right or Feature Nullified
          10.3.3 . If an Early Taxation Event is earlier than the date on which the statute, regulation or pronouncement giving rise to the Early Taxation Event is enacted or promulgated, as applicable (i.e., if the change in the law is retroactive), there shall be
Tax Distribution
 
distributed to each Participant, as soon as practicable following such date of enactment or promulgation, the amounts that became taxable on the Early Taxation Event.
     10.4 . The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan by action of its Board. The Company also reserves the right to suspend the operation of the Plan for a fixed or indeterminate period of time, by action of its Board.
Plan Termination or Plan Suspension
     10.5 . Any corporation or other business organization which is a successor to the Company by reason of a consolidation, merger or purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any other Change in Control, shall have the right to become a party to the Plan by adopting the same by resolution of the entity's board of directors or other appropriate governing body. If, within ninety (90) days from the effective date of such consolidation, merger or sale of assets, or Change in Control such new entity does not become a party hereto, as above provided, the Plan automatically shall be terminated.
Successor to Company
     11.1 . In the event that a Participant becomes employed by any affiliated company, subsidiary corporation, parent corporation or unrelated corporation which the Company enters into a transaction to acquire the assets or stock of such unrelated corporation, the Committee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Trustee to transfer funds in an amount equal to the amount credited to such Participant's Account (the "Transferred Account") to a trust established under a Transferee Plan. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether such transfer shall be made and the timing of such transfer. Such transfer shall be made only if, and to the extent that, approval of such transfer is obtained from the Trustee.
Transfers to Other Plans
          11.1.1 . For purposes of this Section 11.1, "Transferee Plan" shall mean an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(l) of ERISA maintained by any of the Company's affiliated entities, subsidiary corporations, parent corporations or any corporation unrelated to the Company which the Company has successfully closed a transaction in which the Company acquired the assets or the outstanding stock of such an unrelated corporation.
Transferee Plan
          11.1.2 . No transfer shall be made under this Section 11.1 unless the Participant for whose benefit the Transferred Account is held executes a written waiver of all of such Participant's rights and benefits under this Plan in such form as shall be acceptable to the Committee and the Committee determines that such a transfer is permissible under applicable law, including specifically Section 409A of the Code, and would not result in the recognition of current income by any Plan Participant.
Waiver
          11.2 . There may be transferred directly from the trustee of another nonqualified, funded, deferred compensation plan (an "Other Plan") to the Trustee, subject to the approval of the transferor corporation maintaining the Other Plan, the Committee, and the Eligible Individual, funds in an amount not to exceed the amount credited to the Other Plan accounts maintained for the benefit of that Eligible Individual.

Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
           On November 2, 2005, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 25, 2005. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
           The attached press release presents pro forma financial measurements which are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results, and the Company believes that pro forma reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in its industry.
           The attached press release presents pro forma financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, to facilitate evaluation of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company's management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative view of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
           The attached press release presents pro forma financial results as though the method of recording royalties in fiscal 2005 (referred to as the new method), based solely on reports from licensees, had been in effect throughout fiscal 2004 to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for fiscal 2004 on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating its performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
           The attached press release presents pro forma results for fiscal 2005 excluding one-time tax benefits related to fiscal 2004 to facilitate an understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating its performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
           The attached press release presents pro forma financial information for fiscal 2006 excluding share-based compensation under FAS 123R to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and other interested parties in its industry of core business operating results. The Company's management uses this pro forma presentation to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results because share-based compensation is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. The Company believes that this presentation is also useful to evaluate performance on a basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of FAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
           The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows" and must be excluded from the GAAP statements of cash flows. Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, most of such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.
           The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the press release.

QUALCOMM Pro Forma Results:
Fourth Quarter
Fiscal 2005
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at .
www.qualcomm.com
 
"Our record financial results reflect the accelerating migration to CDMA throughout the world," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "As of September 2005, there were approximately 159 operators offering third generation services in 71 countries with over 200 million subscribers."
"We aggressively increased our R&D investment in fiscal 2005. QUALCOMM consistently leads the market with innovative wireless solutions benefiting suppliers, operators and consumers. A significant result is that QUALCOMM's WCDMA/HSDPA solutions have been selected by more than 30 handset manufacturers around the world and a number of very exciting wireless devices based on our chipsets will be introduced by the end of this year. In addition, our CDMA2000 1xEV-DO solutions power more than 120 commercially available devices around the world, as existing networks are expanded and new networks are launched. Our pioneering work in DO has been adapted to create HSDPA, and QUALCOMM is recognized as a leading innovator in both of these technologies. The multimedia capabilities of our Launchpad suite of software and our BREW applications platform have seen tremendous uptake over the past year as operators have increasingly focused on data as a source for new revenue streams. We recently demonstrated MediaFLO working over-the-air and we remain optimistic about a significant commercial launch next year. The technical superiority of our MediaFLO technology will enable the delivery of high quality video to the mass market."
"Looking forward, we anticipate 2006 to be yet another strong growth year with new CDMA handset shipments growing approximately 30% year-over-year. The wireless market continues to evolve at a rapid pace and QUALCOMM will continue increasing R&D investments in fiscal 2006 to capture the many opportunities ahead and maintain or extend our leadership position in the market."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $8.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to $7.9 billion on June 26, 2005 and $7.6 billion on September 26, 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized approximately $43 million of investment income related to put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program
 
which, if exercised, will require us to repurchase an additional 11.5 million shares for $411 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we made the decision to repatriate approximately $0.5 billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) expenses were $271 million in the fourth fiscal quarter and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2005, up 30 and 40 percent year-over-year, respectively. Increases in R&D are primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO (Forward Link Only) technology, MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and iMoD display products. R&D expenses included $16 million in the fourth quarter and $49 million in fiscal 2005 attributable to the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment for MediaFLO USA, as compared to $8 million in the prior year quarter and $25 million in fiscal 2004.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $178 million in the fourth fiscal quarter and $631 million in fiscal 2005, up 29 and 15 percent year-over-year, respectively. Increases in fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 SG&A expenses compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 are largely attributable to increases in legal and patent related expenses, headcount growth and the offsetting effect of other income in the prior year periods that reduced SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses included $10 million of expenses in the fourth quarter and $20 million of expenses in fiscal 2005 attributable to the QSI segment, as compared to $3 million of income in the prior year quarter and $4 million of income in fiscal 2004.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate for total QUALCOMM is 24 percent, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 22 percent. Our fiscal 2005 pro forma effective tax rate is 30 percent, compared to our previous estimate of 28 percent. The increase in our annual effective tax rates as compared to our previous estimates for total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM pro forma is primarily the result of $35 million additional tax expense related to our decision to repatriate on a
 
one-time basis approximately $0.5 billion of qualifying foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. With this additional tax expense, the rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 are 32% for total QUALCOMM and 33% for QUALCOMM pro forma.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 results consisted of $26 million of operating expenses primarily related to MediaFLO USA and $4 million in equity in losses of investees, partially offset by $3 million in realized gains on investments. Total QUALCOMM results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 include break-even and $0.06 diluted earnings per share for the QSI segment, respectively, compared to $0.03 and $0.01 earnings per share in the year-ago comparable periods.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI and asset impairments cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
The following business outlook for total QUALCOMM includes the effects of the Company's adoption of SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which requires the expensing of share-based payment programs. A pro forma outlook is provided consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein and excludes share-based compensation. The total QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM pro forma outlook summary is detailed herein.
Fiscal 2006 earnings per share include a decrease of approximately $0.18 per share for total QUALCOMM related to a preliminary estimate of share-based compensation expense, and a decrease of approximately $0.03 per share due to the ELATA acquisition which closed in August and the anticipated Flarion acquisition which is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2006. The expiration of royalty-sharing obligations under two agreements, one in fiscal 2005 and the other in fiscal 2006,
 
will contribute to an increase in our royalty revenues in fiscal 2006 and beyond. In fiscal 2006, we expect the termination of these royalty sharing obligations to contribute approximately $290 to $310 million to our fiscal 2006 revenue and pretax earnings. We also expect a tax rate for fiscal 2006 of approximately 24 percent for total QUALCOMM and approximately 27 percent for QUALCOMM pro forma.
Our handset shipment forecast will be discussed in more detail during our fourth quarter conference call. This call is scheduled for 2:30pm (on Wednesday November 2, 2005. Refer to conference call dial-in information included at the end of this press release.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Pro forma financial measurements are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results, and the Company believes that pro forma reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in its industry. The Company presents pro forma financial information excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment to facilitate evaluation of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT), QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI). QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. Management believes that the information excluding QSI presents a more representative view of the operating and liquidity performance of the Company because it excludes the effect of fluctuations in the values of investments that are unrelated to the Company's operational performance.
The Company presents pro forma financial results for fiscal 2004 as though the New Method of recording royalties had been in effect throughout fiscal 2004 to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and analysts of the results for fiscal 2004 on a comparable basis to the Company's current results, current guidance and future periods. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company presents pro forma results for fiscal 2005 excluding one-time tax benefits related to fiscal 2004 to facilitate an understanding of its ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
The Company present pro forma financial results for fiscal 2006 excluding share-based compensation under FAS 123R to facilitate evaluation by management, investors and other interested parties in its industry of core business operating results. The Company's management uses this pro forma presentation to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results because share-based compensation is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. The Company believes that this presentation is also useful to evaluate performance on a basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of FAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On November 2, 2005, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company"), the Committee approved bonuses of the Company's executive officers for fiscal year 2005. The Committee also approved the annual base salaries (effective as of December 17, 2005) of the Company's executive officers after a review of performance and competitive market data and approved additional grants of options to purchase the Company's stock for such individuals. The following table sets forth: the fiscal year 2005 bonus, the annual base salary levels for 2006 and the number of shares subject to newly-approved option grants for the Company's Named Executive Officers (which officers were determined by reference to the Company's proxy statement dated January 14, 2005 who will continue to be employed by the Company during calendar 2006, as well individuals expected to be Named Executive Officers in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual stockholder meeting).
     On November 4, 2005, the Committee approved the terms of the 2006 Annual Bonus Program applicable to key employees of the Company, including the Company's executive officers. The design of the Company's 2006 Annual Bonus Program (the "Bonus Program") is substantially similar to the Company's 2005, 2004 and other prior year programs, and all such programs reward achievement at specified levels of financial and individual performance.
     Under the Bonus Program each officer position has an assigned base target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year end annual salary. Each officer position also has an assigned "stretch" target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year end annual salary. The target bonus levels are competitive with target bonuses for similar positions reported in independent, third-party published surveys reviewed by the Committee. Depending on corporate and business unit financial performance and individual performance, each officer may earn between 0 and 2.5x of the base target. Two components comprise the fundamental design of the Bonus Program:
Table of Contents
     The Committee's approval of the terms of the Bonus Program shall not be deemed to create an enforceable agreement between the Company and any employee or executive officer, and the Committee retains discretion to reduce or refuse to authorize any awards under the Bonus Program despite attainment of any specific objectives. No rights to any awards shall be deemed to exist unless and until the Committee or, with respect to non-executive officers, the Company, authorizes payment of any awards under the Bonus Program following the completion of any fiscal year measurement periods.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
QUALCOMM Completes Acquisition of Flarion Technologies
SAN DIEGO  January 19, 2006  QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and other advanced wireless technologies, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Flarion Technologies, a pioneer and leading developer of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA) technology and the inventor of FLASH-OFDM technology for mobile broadband Internet protocol (IP) services. The acquisition expands QUALCOMM's already extensive portfolio of OFDMA intellectual property and enhances the Company's engineering team with expertise in OFDMA technology and products.
QUALCOMM paid approximately $600 million in QUALCOMM stock and cash, including the assumption of vested options and warrants at fair value. Upon the satisfaction of certain milestones, QUALCOMM may also pay an additional $205 million in the form of cash and QUALCOMM stock.
As previously announced, on Jan. 13, 2006 the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice informed QUALCOMM and Flarion that it had terminated its review of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (see QUALCOMM announcement, Jan. 16, 2006).
"Flarion's expert engineering staff provides a significant addition to the resources that we have dedicated over the years to develop OFDM and OFDMA technologies. Its impressive intellectual property enhances our substantial OFDMA portfolio," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of QUALCOMM. "While CDMA remains the optimal technology to provide broadband, spectrally efficient, mobile wide area wireless networks for the foreseeable future, OFDMA's low complexity at wide signal bandwidths makes it a potential alternative where large blocks of spectrum can be dedicated. This acquisition greatly enhances QUALCOMM's ability to accelerate the development of both CDMA and OFDMA in support of its customers and partners."
QUALCOMM expects the acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 dilution to pro forma earnings per share  primarily R&D expense  and an additional $0.01 dilution to total QUALCOMM earnings per share  primarily stock option expense and a one-time in-process R&D charge  in its fiscal year ending September 2006.
Flarion has a world-class team and an expansive portfolio of OFDMA intellectual property. The combination of Flarion and QUALCOMM's engineering resources strengthens QUALCOMM's position as a leader in advanced wireless technology development and enhances QUALCOMM's ability to design and license OFDMA systems, components and products for operators interested in OFDMA for certain present and future networks. The majority of Flarion's employees, including its strong engineering base, will be employed by QUALCOMM.
QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2005 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
Except for the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including QUALCOMM's ability to successfully develop and deploy products based on OFDMA technology, whether additional patents will issue based on Flarion's technology, as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2005, and most recent Form 10-Q.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 25, 2006, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first quarter ended December 25, 2005. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, tax benefits related to prior years, and acquired in-process R&D expense. Pro forma financial measures used by the Company's management include pro forma revenues, pro forma cost of equipment and services revenues, pro forma R&D expenses, pro forma SG&A expenses, pro forma total operating expenses, pro forma operating income (loss), pro forma net investment income, pro forma income before income taxes, pro forma income tax expense, pro forma effective tax rate, pro forma diluted earnings per share, pro forma operating cash flow, and pro forma free cash flow. Pro forma information is used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results, and the Company believes that pro forma reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in its industry.
     The Company uses pro forma financial information excluding QSI and share-based compensation to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results because the effects of fluctuations in the value of investments and share-based compensation are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance, and share-based compensation is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. QSI results relate to strategic investments for which the Company has exit strategies of varying durations. The Company believes that financial data excluding the QSI segment and the estimate of share-based compensation provides investors with meaningful information about the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet. This presentation is also useful to investors in evaluating performance on a basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of FAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
     The attached press release presents pro forma results excluding certain tax benefits related to prior years to provide management, as well as investors, a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is useful in evaluating its performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     The Company presents pro forma financial information for fiscal 2006 excluding acquired in-process R&D expense to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating performance because acquired in-process R&D expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. Management believes that this presentation is useful to evaluate performance on a consistent and comparable basis.
     The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP presentation to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available to fund operations, which result from cash management strategies designed to increase yields. However, these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." Since the GAAP statements of cash flows reconcile the Company's beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances, the purchases and sales of marketable securities are presented as inflows and outflows. For purposes of internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. If required, most of such investments could be settled relatively quickly as additional cash resources are needed. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful measure of the Company's liquidity.
Table of Contents
     The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management and investors use this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail:

SAN DIEGO  January 25, 2006  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2006 ended December 25, 2005.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) First Quarter Results:
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
QUALCOMM Pro Forma First Quarter Results:
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation and tax benefits related to prior years.
-more-
 
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at
www.qualcomm.com.
"We delivered record first quarter revenue and strong year-over-year growth led by demand for our chips," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of QUALCOMM. "I'm pleased to see continued execution on our product roadmaps as we partner with manufacturers, operators and developers to bring new innovations to market. In emerging wireless markets like China and India, demand for low-end CDMA phones is increasing; in more established markets like the United States, South Korea, Japan and Europe, subscribers continue to migrate and upgrade to feature rich 3G devices and services."
"Looking forward, we expect continued growth of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO products in North America, Japan, South Korea and Latin America. We remain encouraged by the consumer uptake of WCDMA services in Japan and Europe, and will continue working closely with operators during their ongoing WCDMA and HSDPA network deployment and optimization efforts. We remain well positioned to capitalize on the growth of 3G, thanks to the extensive value chain of partnerships that exists to rapidly bring new innovations to consumers and enterprise customers."
"QUALCOMM has a proven history of bringing the most advanced wireless technologies to market for large-scale deployments. The recent closure of the Flarion acquisition enhances QUALCOMM's strong position in OFDMA and further demonstrates our commitment to consistently add to our intellectual property (IP) portfolio through internal research and development and acquisition. Our research and development activities combined with our unique business model help enable our partners to supply wireless products and services with new features and functionality that drive incremental revenue growth for the industry."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $8.7 billion at the end of the prior quarter and $8.0 billion a year ago. On January 12, 2006, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share, payable on March 24, 2006 to stockholders of record on February 24, 2006.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires that share-based compensation be recorded in our financial statements. Historically, this had been identified in the footnote disclosures to our financial statements in accordance with FAS 123. We have implemented FAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Our share-based compensation is estimated utilizing a lattice binomial option valuation model and has been classified in the appropriate categories of our operating expenses. However, estimated share-based compensation is not allocated to our business segments because we do not consider it relevant when evaluating the operating performance of our business segments, and is also excluded from QUALCOMM pro forma results. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 included estimated share-based compensation of $82 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per share.
Research and Development
Pro forma research and development (R&D) expenses increased 25 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our iMoD display
 
products. QSI R&D expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to increased expenses related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses to support our growing worldwide customer base, and professional fees related to legal and patent activities. QSI SG&A expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to increased expenses related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22 percent, compared to 24 percent in fiscal 2005. Our fiscal 2006 QUALCOMM pro forma effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 26 percent, compared to 30 percent in fiscal 2005. The decrease in our fiscal 2006 estimated annual effective tax rates compared to our fiscal 2005 tax rates for both total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma is primarily the result of projected increased foreign earnings in 2006 taxed at a lower rate. A benefit of approximately $0.03 per share was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 related to the expected impact of prior year tax audits completed during the quarter. This benefit reduced the rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) to approximately 16 percent. For fiscal 2006 QUALCOMM pro forma presentation we excluded this $0.03 diluted earnings per share benefit to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 include $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment compared to $0.02 diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The
 
first quarter fiscal 2006 QSI results include $28 million of operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA, and $20 million of equity in losses of investees.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
Although estimated share-based compensation is included in the business outlook for total QUALCOMM (GAAP), actual estimated share-based compensation recorded under FAS 123R may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other variable factors. A pro forma business outlook is provided below consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein and also excludes in-process R&D expense related to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
We continue to expect strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in 2006 and are reaffirming our fiscal 2006 revenue and earnings guidance for total QUALCOMM (GAAP), QUALCOMM pro forma and our 2006 calendar year handset guidance.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, tax benefits related to prior years, and acquired in-process R&D expense. Pro forma financial measures used by the Company's management include pro forma revenues, pro forma cost of equipment and services revenues, pro forma R&D expenses, pro forma SG&A expenses, pro forma total operating expenses, pro forma operating income (loss), pro forma net investment income, pro forma income before income taxes, pro forma income tax expense, pro forma effective tax rate, pro forma diluted earnings per share, pro forma operating cash flow, and pro forma free cash flow.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
     At the annual stockholder meeting held on March 7, 2006, the stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QUALCOMM or the Company) approved the QUALCOMM 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2006 LTIP). The 2006 LTIP will replace the Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and their predecessor plans and will be the source of shares issued under the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (ERMCP).
     The purpose of the 2006 LTIP is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing employees, non-employee directors, and other eligible participants with stock-based financial incentives to align participants' interests with the interests of the stockholders in the long-term growth and success of the Company.
     The 2006 LTIP permits the award of various forms of incentive awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, deferred compensation awards and other stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the type of incentive award, as well as the terms and conditions of the award, under the 2006 LTIP.
     As of December 19, 2005, a maximum of 290,284,432 shares of QUALCOMM common stock (subject to adjustment for changes in capital structure, stock dividends, or other similar events) are reserved for use under the 2006 LTIP. Shares of QUALCOMM common stock covered by incentive awards previously granted under the predecessor plans may be reused or added back to the 2006 LTIP under certain circumstances. The 2006 LTIP also contains other limits with respect to the terms of different types of incentive awards and with respect to the number of shares subject to awards that can be granted to an employee during any fiscal year.
     The 2006 LTIP is described in detail in the Company's 2006 proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders held on March 7, 2006. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2006 LTIP filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The forms of grant notice and stock option agreement are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2.
Grant of Stock Options to Non-Employee Directors
     As indicated above, the 2006 LTIP replaced the Company's 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan. Effective upon stockholder approval of the 2006 LTIP, the Company granted each of the 11 Non-Employee Directors an option to purchase 18,000 shares of QUALCOMM common stock at an exercise price of $47.24 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on March 7, 2006 (the date of grant). The options vest and become exercisable over a five year period. During the first year, ten percent of the options vest at the six month anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter 1/60th of the total options vest on a monthly basis.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On March 7, 2006, after due approval by the Board of Directors and receipt of the requisite vote of the Company's stockholders earlier that day, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amendment) that eliminated the classified Board of Directors (which had provided for directors to serve staggered terms of three years with approximately one-third of the Board being subject to election each year) and eliminated cumulative voting in the election of directors. This description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment filed herewith as Exhibit 99.3.
     In addition, on March 7, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the New Restated Certificate), which integrated the provisions of the Company's prior Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as it had been amended, including by the Amendment. This description of the New Restated Certificate set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Restated Certificate filed herewith as Exhibit 99.4. The New Restated Certificate was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State shortly after the filing of the Amendment.
     Also on March 7, 2006, the Board of Directors adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Restated Bylaws) of the Company, effective after the filing of the Amendment, to supersede and replace the existing Bylaws of the Company. The Restated Bylaws include, among other things, revisions that reflect the changes to the Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the classified Board of Directors and to eliminate cumulative voting. The Restated Bylaws also authorize written consents of the Board of Directors to be effected by electronic transmission. This description of the Restated Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Bylaws filed herewith as Exhibit 99.5.

However, a Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to date on which Stock Units held by such Participant are settled. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole and/or fractional Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The method of determining the number of additional Stock Units to be so credited shall be specified by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. Such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time (or as soon thereafter as practicable) as the Stock Units originally subject to the Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant's Stock Unit Award so that it represent the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award.

Such shares of Stock shall be fully vested, and the Participant shall not be required to pay any additional consideration (other than applicable tax withholding) to acquire such shares. Any fractional Stock Unit subject to the Stock Unit Award shall be settled by the Company by payment in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the payment date of such fractional share.
Settlement of Stock Unit Awards.
               (iii) Prior to their settlement in accordance with the provision of the Plan, no Stock Unit Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

13.
EFFECT OF CHANGE IN CONTROL ON OPTIONS AND SARS.
     13.1 The Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement or, in the event of a Change in Control, may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting in connection with such Change in Control of any or all outstanding Options and SARs and shares acquired upon the exercise of such Options and SARs upon such conditions and to such extent as the Committee shall determine. The previous sentence notwithstanding such acceleration shall not occur to the extent an Option or SAR is assumed or substituted with a substantially similar Award in connection with a Change in Control.
Accelerated Vesting.
     13.2 In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the ), may, without the consent of the Participant, either assume the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Options and SARs or substitute for outstanding Options and SARs substantially equivalent options or stock appreciation rights for the Acquiring Corporation's stock. Any Options or SARs which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of an Option or SAR prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement evidencing such Award except as otherwise provided in such Award Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the outstanding Options or SARs immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 2.1(z)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the outstanding Options and SARs shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.

Any acceleration, waiver or the lapsing of any restriction that was permissible solely by reason of this Section 13.3 and the provisions of such Award Agreement shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control.

In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in
 
respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

     17.3 No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right
Rights as Employee, Consultant or Director.
 
to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time. To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.
     17.4 . A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).

Fractional Shares.
     17.6 If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability.
     17.7 Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse. If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.
Beneficiary Designation.
     17.8 Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations. The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder. Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company. The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan. Each Participating Company shall be responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Participants or for reimbursing the Company for the cost of such payments, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. In the event the respective Participating Company fails to make such payment or reimbursement, a Participant's (or other individual's) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Company, and not against the Company. A Participant's acceptance of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.

     In the event of a Change in Control, any unexercisable or unvested portion of this Option and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof held by you if your Service has not terminated prior to such date shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior to the date of the Change in Control.

     FIRST: The name of the corporation is QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Corporation").
     SECOND: Article VI of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is amended to read in its entirety as follows, except for subsections B, C, D and E, as noted below, which shall remain unchanged:
     For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:
     A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected.
     At the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, the directors shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in
 
the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
     Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes shall be filled by either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") voting together as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with this paragraph shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified."
     "F. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. If the holders of any class or series of capital stock are entitled to elect one (1) or more directors by this certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time, the removal of such directors without cause shall be by a vote of the outstanding shares of that series or class of capital stock and not the outstanding shares of capital stock as a whole."
     THIRD: The foregoing amendments were duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is six billion eight million (6,008,000,000) shares. Six billion (6,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). Eight million (8,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of one one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001).
     The relative rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the respective classes and series of shares are as follows:
     A. .
COMMON STOCK
     The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as designated herein and as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the corporation upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.
 
     B. .
PREFERRED STOCK
     The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a certificate pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of them (a "Preferred Stock Designation"); and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.
     On September 26, 1995, the Board of Directors created a series of Preferred Stock designated as the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The relative designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof (in addition to the provisions otherwise set forth in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which are applicable to the Preferred Stock of all classes and series), as such were amended by the Board of Directors on September 26, 2005, are as set forth in the resolutions attached hereto as .
Attachment 1
     For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:
     A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected.
     At the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, the directors shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
     Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes shall be filled by either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") voting together as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with this paragraph shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.
     B. The Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal the Bylaws.
     C. The directors of the corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.
     D. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
     E. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the corporation.
     F. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. If the holders of any class or series of capital stock are entitled to elect one (1) or more directors by this certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time, the removal of such directors without cause shall be by a vote of the outstanding shares of that series or class of capital stock and not the outstanding shares of capital stock as a whole.
 
     A director of the corporation shall, to the full extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director.
     A. (1) In addition to any affirmative vote required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in Section B of this Article VIII:
               (i) any merger or consolidation of the corporation or any Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) with (a) any Interested Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) or (b) any other corporation (whether or not itself an Interested Stockholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of an Interested Stockholder; or
               (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder of any assets of the corporation or any Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) equal to or greater than 15% of the Corporation's assets as set forth on the Corporation's most recent audited consolidated financial statements; or
               (iii) the issuance or transfer by the corporation or any Subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary to any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder in exchange for cash, securities or other property (or a combination thereof) having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to or greater than 15% of the Corporation's assets as set forth on the Corporation's most recent audited consolidated financial statements; or
               (iv) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; or
               (v) any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or recapitalization of the corporation, or any merger or consolidation of the corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving any Interested Stockholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary which is Beneficially Owned (as hereinafter defined) by any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder;
shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law or of any agreement with any national
 
securities exchange or otherwise which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote.
          (2) The term "Business Combination" as used in this Article VIII shall mean any transaction which is referred to in any one or more of subparagraphs (i) through (v) of paragraph (1) of this Section A.
     B. The provisions of Section A of this Article VIII shall not be applicable to any particular Business Combination, and such Business Combination shall require only such affirmative vote as is required by law, any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation and any Preferred Stock Designation, if, in the case of a Business Combination that does not involve any cash or other consideration being received by the stockholders of the corporation, solely in their respective capacities as stockholders of the corporation, the condition specified in the following paragraph (1) is met, or, in the case of any other Business Combination, the conditions specified in either of the following paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) are met:
          (1) The Business Combination shall have been approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors (as hereinafter defined); provided however, that this condition shall not be capable of satisfaction unless there are at least two Continuing Directors.
          (2) All of the following conditions shall have been met:
               (i) The consideration to be received by holders of shares of a particular class (or series) of outstanding Voting Stock (including Common Stock and other than Excluded Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined)) shall be in cash or in the same form as the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has previously paid for shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock. If the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates have paid for shares of any class (or series) of Voting Stock with varying forms of consideration, the form of consideration to be received per share by holders of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock shall be either cash or the form used to acquire the largest number of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock previously acquired by the Interested Stockholder.
               (ii) The aggregate amount of (x) the cash and (y) the Fair Market Value, as of the date (the "Consummation Date") of the consummation of the Business Combination, of the consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of Common Stock in such Business Combination shall be at least equal to the higher of the following (in each case appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or similar event):
                    (a) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates for any shares of Common Stock acquired by them within the two-year period immediately prior to the date of the first public announcement of the proposal of the Business Combination (the "Announcement Date") or in any transaction in which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from the first date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder (the "Determination Date") through the Consummation Date at the publicly announced reference rate of interest of Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. (or such other
 
major bank headquartered in the State of California as may be selected by the Continuing Directors) from time to time in effect in the City of San Francisco less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the Fair Market Value of any dividends paid in other than cash, on each share of Common Stock from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of interest so payable per share of Common Stock; and
                    (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Announcement Date or the Determination Date, whichever is higher.
               (iii) The aggregate amount of (x) the cash and (y) the Fair Market Value, as of the Consummation Date, of the consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of shares of any class (or series), other than Stock or Excluded Preferred Stock, of outstanding Voting Stock shall be at least equal to the highest of the following (in each case appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or similar event), it being intended that the requirements of this paragraph (2)(iii) shall be required to be met with respect to every such class (or series) of outstanding Voting Stock whether or not the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has previously acquired any shares of a particular class (or series) of Voting Stock):
                    (a) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates for any shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock acquired by them within the two-year period immediately prior to the Announcement Date or in any transaction in which it became an Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date at the publicly announced reference rate of interest of Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. (or such other major bank headquartered in the State of California as may be selected by the Continuing Directors) from time to time in effect in the City of San Francisco less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the Fair Market Value of any dividends paid in other than cash, on each share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock from the Determination Date through the Consummation Date in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of interest so payable per share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock;
                    (b) the Fair Market Value per share of such class (or series) of Voting Stock on the Announcement Date or on the Determination Date, whichever is higher; and
                    (c) the highest preferential amount per share, if any, to which the holders of shares of such class (or series) of Voting Stock would be entitled in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation.
               (iv) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested Stockholder and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination: (a) except as approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, there shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date therefor any full quarterly dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any outstanding Preferred Stock; (b) there shall have been (I) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the
 
Common Stock), except as approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, and (II) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any reverse stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, unless the failure so to increase such annual rate is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and (c) neither such Interested Stockholder nor any of its Affiliates shall have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock except as part of the transaction which results in such Interested Stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder; provided, however, that no approval by Continuing Directors shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph (iv) unless at the time of such approval there are at least two Continuing Directors.
               (v) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder and any of its Affiliates shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately, solely in such Interested Stockholder's or Affiliate's capacity as a stockholder of the corporation), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.
               (vi) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to all stockholders of the corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).
               (vii) Such Interested Stockholder shall have supplied the corporation with such information as shall have been requested pursuant to Section E of this Article VIII within the time period set forth therein.

          (3) A person shall be a "Beneficial Owner" of, or shall "Beneficially Own," any Voting Stock:

               (iii) which is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the adoption date of this Certificate of Incorporation, by any other person with which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (other than solely by reason of a revocable proxy as described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph (3) or disposing of any shares of Voting Stock; provided, however, that in case of any employee stock ownership or similar plan of the corporation or of any Subsidiary in which the beneficiaries thereof possess the right to vote any shares of Voting Stock held by such plan, no such plan nor any trustee with respect thereto (nor any Affiliate of such trustee), solely by reason of such capacity of such trustee, shall be deemed, for any purposes hereof, to beneficially own any shares of Voting Stock held under any such plan.
          (4) For the purposes of determining whether a person is an Interested Stockholder pursuant to paragraph (2) of this Section C, the number of shares of Voting Stock deemed to be outstanding shall include shares deemed owned through application of paragraph (3) of this Section C but shall not include any other unissued shares of Voting Stock which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

     The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in Article IX of this Certificate, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this right.
 
          ", that, pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the designation and terms of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation established pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 1995 and incorporated into Attachment 1 to the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State March 10, 2005, shall be amended in their entirety to read as follows:
RESOLVED
               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
               SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT. Four Million (4,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, $.0001 par value, are designated "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" with the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions specified herein (the "Junior Preferred Stock"). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Junior Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Junior Preferred Stock.
               SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
               (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Junior Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of April, July, October and January in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend
 
Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 26, 2005 (the "Designation Date") declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Junior Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
               (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Junior Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
               SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
               (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Junior Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
 
Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
               (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Junior Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
               SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
               (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Junior Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Junior Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
                    (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock;
                    (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
                    (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Junior Preferred Stock; or
                    (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Junior Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Junior Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
               (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
               SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of Junior Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may by reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
               SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Junior Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Junior Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Junior Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Junior Preferred stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Designation Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock
 
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
               SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION. The shares of Junior Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
               SECTION 9. RANK. The Junior Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.
               SECTION 10. AMENDMENT. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Junior Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class."

          (b) If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, or the Secretary of the corporation.

Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229).
     Section 8. .

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of Directors) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216).

At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.

Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.

          (a) . The corporation shall indemnify its Directors and executive officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the corporation may limit the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its Directors and executive officers; and, provided, further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against the corporation or its Directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation or (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Directors and Executive Officers
          (b) . The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents
          (c) .
Good Faith
               (i) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or executive officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
                    (A) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the matters the Director or executive officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
                    (B) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or executive officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and
 
                    (C) with respect to a Director, a committee of the Board upon which such Director does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee the Director believes to merit confidence; so long as, in each case, the Director or executive officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
               (ii) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
               (iii) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
          (d) . The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
          (e) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
Enforcement
 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
          (f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.

Amendments
          (j) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
Saving Clause
          (k) . For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply:

               (iv) References to a "Director," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     Section 44.

          (a) . Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, it shall be given in writing, timely and duly deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to his last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222).

          (b) . Any notice required to be given to any Director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by facsimile, telex, telegram, commercial courier service, personal delivery, telephone, voice message system or electronic transmission, except that such notice other than one which is delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such Director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such Director.
Notice to Directors
          (c) . If no address of a stockholder or Director be known, notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 hereof.

(Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222).

          (e) . All notices given by mail or commercial courier service shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of dispatch, all notices by personal delivery or telephone shall be deemed to have been given as of receipt by the designee or a person accepting notice on behalf of such Director, and all notices given by facsimile, telex, telegram, voice message system or electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given as of the sending time recorded at the time of transmission.
Time Notices Deemed Given
          (f) . It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all Directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.

The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any Director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such Director to receive such notice.
Failure to Receive Notice
          (h) . Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such
Notice to Person with Undeliverable Address
 
person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this paragraph. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 230).
     Section 45. . Except as otherwise set forth in paragraph (i) of Section 43 of these Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. The Board of Directors shall also have the power, if such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation, to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 109(a), 122(6)).

The loan, guarantee or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 143).
Loans to Officers
     Section 47. .
Annual Report
          (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the Board of Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder of the corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the corporation's fiscal year. Such report shall include a balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon of independent accountants or, if there is no such report, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation. When there are more than 100 stockholders of record of the
 
corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California Corporations Code, additional information as required by Section 1501(b) of the California Corporations Code shall also be contained in such report, provided that if the corporation has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, that Act shall take precedence. Such report shall be sent to stockholders at least fifteen (15) days prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders after the end of the fiscal year to which it relates.
          (b) If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of the corporation's shares, the requirement of sending of an annual report to the stockholders of the corporation is hereby expressly waived.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 19, 2006, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second quarter ended March 26, 2006. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax benefits related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax benefits related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     Management is able to assess what it believes is a more fundamentally pure and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The GAAP statements of cash flows report the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company's management uses free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-

term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the attached press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858)651-9303 (fax) e-mail: ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  April 19, 2006  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for the second fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2006.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) Second Quarter Results:
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
QUALCOMM Pro Forma Second Quarter Results:
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense and tax benefits related to prior years.

Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"QUALCOMM's record revenue this quarter was driven by greater overall CDMA handset shipments and record demand for our chipsets," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of QUALCOMM. "I am pleased that demand for our chipsets was spread across our broadly segmented products with particular strength in higher tier chipsets for CDMA20001xEV-DO and WCDMA/HSPDA and in the lower tier MSM6000 chipsets for CDMA2000 emerging markets. This broad demand is testimony to the fact that CDMA-based networks enable advanced data capabilities for developed markets as well as effectively serving more voice centric developing markets. CDMA market growth is an important goal for QUALCOMM and a key ingredient to increasing shareholder value. We will focus on that goal by enabling our partners with products and services to meet the increasing needs of their customers."
"While we continue to execute well on meeting the needs of our partners with existing products and services, I am optimistic about the market acceptance of new and future products including DO Revision A and B, HSDPA, HSUPA, MediaFLO, single chip solutions and uiOne for customizing the user interface on a wireless handset. Being first to market with chipsets for DO, DO Revision A, HSDPA and HSUPA is indicative of our technology leadership and our ability to execute on our research and development investments."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $10.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the prior quarter and $8.3 billion a year ago. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we paid $285 million in cash for acquisitions, and we announced a 33 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.09 to $0.12 per share. A cash dividend of $0.12 per common share is payable on June 23, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2006.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted the revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires that share-based compensation be recorded in our financial statements. We have implemented FAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Estimated share-based compensation is included in operating expenses, however, it is not allocated to business segments or included in pro forma results because we do not consider it relevant when evaluating the operating performance of our business. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 included estimated share-based compensation of $78 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per share.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 25 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000, 1xEV-DO, DO Revision A, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA, and the
 
development of our iMoD display products using MEMS technology. QSI R&D expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to increased R&D activities related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 26 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses to support our growing worldwide customer base, and professional fees related to legal activities. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22 percent. The second quarter tax rate of 25 percent for total QUALCOMM is higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate due primarily to $56 million of tax benefits recorded in the first quarter related to the expected impact of prior year tax audits completed during that quarter. Our fiscal 2006 QUALCOMM pro forma effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 27 percent, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 26 percent.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 included $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The second quarter fiscal 2006 QSI results include $32 million of operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA, and $10 million of equity in losses of investees, partially offset by $6 million of realized gains on investments.
 
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 based on the current business outlook. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) guidance for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 includes approximately $0.05 diluted loss per share related to estimated share-based compensation. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors. A pro forma business outlook is provided below consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.
Our updated guidance, as compared to our prior guidance, reflects an increase in our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2006. In addition, we are increasing our estimate for calendar 2006 handset shipments by approximately 8%, which is based on indications of increased market demand. Our handset shipment forecast will be discussed in more detail during our second quarter conference call. This call is scheduled for 1:45pm (PDT) on Wednesday, April 19, 2006. Refer to conference call dial-in information included at the end of this press release.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency
 
of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax benefits related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax benefits related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
Management is able to assess what it believes is a more fundamentally pure and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents
 
and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The GAAP statements of cash flows report the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 19, 2006, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third quarter ended June 25, 2006. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax benefits related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax benefits related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The statements of cash flows reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) present the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.
 
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company's management uses free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President, Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858)651-9303(fax) e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  July 19, 2006  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for the third fiscal quarter ended June 25, 2006.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) Third Quarter Results:
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
QUALCOMM Pro Forma Third Quarter Results:
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, tax benefits related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at
www.qualcomm.com.
"Our results this quarter were driven by continued customer demand for our broadly segmented chipsets with particular strength in 1xEV-DO and WCDMA," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "WCDMA handset shipments continue to increase and WCDMA Mobile Station Modem (MSM) unit shipments increased 24 percent from the March quarter."
"We shipped a record number of cell site modem voice-equivalent channel elements in the quarter, which was primarily driven by demand for our EV-DO Rev A CSM6800 solution. Several operators, including KDDI, Sprint Nextel, Telecom New Zealand and Verizon have announced plans to upgrade their CDMA networks to EV-DO Rev A technology as early as this calendar year. CDMA subscribers and enterprise customers worldwide will soon benefit from the unmatched broadband performance of EV-DO Rev A. In addition, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) on EV-DO Rev A will enable in-band migration to fully packet-based networks and ultimately to much higher data rates via EV-DO Rev B multi-carrier operation. We are currently developing VoIP capabilities and data rate enhancement techniques for WCDMA/HSPA networks as well."
"This quarter also demonstrated QUALCOMM's continued focus on enhancing stockholder value. Our balance sheet strength and unique business model provide significant financial flexibility to increase cash dividends and repurchase shares while we continue to grow our R&D investments for the many business opportunities we see ahead."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $10.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter and $7.9 billion a year ago. The decrease from the prior quarter was primarily attributable to stock repurchases in the third quarter. We also sold four put options in connection with our stock repurchase program which, if exercised, will require us to repurchase an additional 4 million shares of our common stock for $182 million, net of premiums received. On July 7, 2006, we announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per common share payable on September 22, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 25, 2006.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted the revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires that share-based compensation be recorded in our financial statements. We implemented FAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Estimated share-based compensation is included in operating expenses, however, it is not allocated to business segments or included in pro forma results because we do not consider it relevant when evaluating the operating performance of our business. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 included estimated share-based compensation of $83 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per share.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 31 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Rev. A, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA, and the development of our iMoD display products using MEMS technology. QSI R&D expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to increased R&D activities related to MediaFLO USA.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 42 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses to support our growing worldwide customer base and professional fees related to legal activities. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA and the effect of other income in the prior year's quarter.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2006 estimated annual effective income tax rates and our third quarter effective income tax rates are approximately 22 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and 26 percent for QUALCOMM pro forma.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 included break-even results for the QSI segment compared to $0.05 diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The third quarter of fiscal 2006 QSI results included $36 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA, and $4 million in other-than-temporary losses on other investments, partially offset by $12 million in realized gains on investments. In addition to the tax benefit applicable to its loss before tax, the QSI segment includes the tax benefit resulting from an increase in the forecast of our ability to use capital loss carryforwards.
 
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 based on the current business outlook. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 includes approximately $0.05 diluted loss per share related to estimated share-based compensation. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors. A pro forma business outlook is provided below consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii)
 
to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax benefits related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax benefits related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation.

The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The GAAP statements of cash flows present the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.

In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA-

To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at the corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 days in advance of the first anniversary of the date that the corporation's (or the corporation's predecessor's) proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days earlier than the date of the prior year' s annual meeting, notice by the stockholders to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the date of the annual meeting is publicly announced.

At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c).

          (a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, (iii) the President, or (iv) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized Directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption), and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix.
          (b) If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. If the notice is not given within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.

Notice of Meetings
 
vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, date and hour and of the meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229).
     Section 8. . At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of Directors) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216).
Quorum
     Section 9. . Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares casting votes, excluding abstentions. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222(c)).
Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings
     Section 10. .

Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an

agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All elections of Directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 211(e), 212(b)).
     Section 11. . If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 217(b)).
Joint Owners of Stock
     Section 12. .

At the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, all Directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, the Directors shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. If for any cause, the Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 141(b), 211(b), (c)).
Number and Term of Office

Successors
     Section 18. . Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes shall be filled by either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (the "Voting Stock") voting together as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Newly created Directorships resulting from any increase in the number of Directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any Director elected in accordance with this paragraph shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any Director, or if the stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which Directors are to be elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 21 below) to elect the number of Directors then constituting the whole Board of Directors. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 223(a), (b)).
Vacancies
     Section 19. . Any Director may resign at any time by delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

In the event that the Board of Directors shall request the resignation of any Director in accordance with the Majority Vote Policy (or any successor to such policy) of the corporation's Corporate Governance Principles and Practices in effect from time to time, such Director shall promptly tender his or her resignation. Any failure to so tender such a resignation shall constitute grounds for removal of such Director for cause in accordance with Section 20 below. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 141(b), 223(d)).
Resignation
     Section 20. . Subject to any limitations imposed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, or any individual Director, may be removed from office at any time (a) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of Directors; or (b) without cause by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such outstanding shares. If the holders of any class or series of capital stock are entitled to elect one (1) or more Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time, the removal of such Directors without cause shall be by a vote of the

Junior Officers, Employees and Other Agents
          (c) .
Good Faith
               (i) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or Designated Officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
                    (A) one or more officers or employees of the corporation as to the matters the Director or Designated Officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
 
                    (B) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or Designated Officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and
                    (C) a committee of the Board of Directors upon which such Director or Designated Officer does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee such Director or Designated Officer believes to merit confidence;
so long as, in each case, the Director or Designated Officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
               (ii) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
               (iii) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
          (d) . The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or Designated Officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
          (e) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and Designated Officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or Designated Officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense
Enforcement
 
to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
          (f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
          (g) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Rights
          (h) . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.
Insurance
          (i) . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
Amendments
          (j) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and Designated Officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On November 2, 2006, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 24, 2006. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities. The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The statements of cash flows reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) present the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.
Table of Contents
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company's management uses free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented in the attached press release.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
QUALCOMM Contact: Bill Davidson Vice President of Global Marketing and Investor Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  November 2, 2006  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2006 year ended September 24, 2006.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) Results:
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
     
Fourth Quarter
     
Fiscal 2006
 
QUALCOMM Pro Forma Results:
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
     
Fourth Quarter
     
Fiscal 2006
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results, and cash flows are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at .
www.qualcomm.com
 
"Our record performance in fiscal 2006 was a direct result of the focus and innovation delivered by the employees of QUALCOMM and the success of our partners," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "We achieved record revenues, net income and operating cash flow. We shipped a record 207 million MSM chips in fiscal 2006  up from 151 million in fiscal 2005. As of September 2006, there were approximately 402 million subscribers using third generation (3G) CDMA-based networks worldwide as compared to approximately 273 million at the same point in 2005."
"3G networks with mobile broadband capability are now widely deployed across the globe, enhancing opportunities to gain new 3G subscribers and for the migration of existing second generation subscribers to 3G. Looking forward to fiscal 2007, our key priorities will be working with our existing chipset customers to improve their market share, winning new customers for our chipset and software solutions, and continuing to expand the base of 3G wireless networks."
"The competition resulting from our business model has led to continual decreases in selling prices of handsets and significant technology advancements which enable further cost reduction and new revenue streams for our partners. Our Company has built the most valuable and widely licensed portfolio of intellectual property in the wireless industry, which we have consistently made available to all on fair and non-discriminatory terms. We will take the necessary actions to ensure that the technology advances embodied in our intellectual property portfolio are protected and that we are fairly compensated for their use. We will continue to fund an expensive but necessary battle to defend our business in the interest of our shareholders."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $9.5 billion at the end of the prior quarter and $8.7 billion a year ago. On October 5, 2006, we announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per common share payable on January 4, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2006.
 
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted the revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires that share-based compensation be recorded in our financial statements. We implemented FAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Estimated share-based compensation is included in operating expenses, however, it is not allocated to business segments or included in pro forma results because we do not consider it relevant when evaluating the operating performance of our business. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 included estimated share-based compensation of $76 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per share.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 33 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multi-mode, multi-band, multi-network products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA, and the development of our iMoD display products using MEMS technology.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 41 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in employee related expenses to support our growing worldwide customer base and professional fees related to legal activities. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2006 effective income tax rates are 22 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and 26 percent for QUALCOMM pro forma, which are unchanged from our previous estimates.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 included break-even results for the QSI segment consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 QSI results included $38 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA, partially offset by $12 million in realized gains on investments. Results for the QSI segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reflect tax benefits as a result of QSI's loss before taxes and realized gains on investments that increased our forecasted utilization of capital loss carryforwards.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain
 
income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors.
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the first fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2007 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein. The table includes a footnote to size the risk, approximately $0.04 to $0.06 diluted earnings per share, of Nokia not paying royalties in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments. Nokia has publicly stated that they intend to continue to use our patents but not pay royalties after the expiration of their rights under those patents on April 9, 2007 should a new license agreement (or extension of the existing agreement) not be reached by that time. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we will be unable to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales until a court awards damages or agreement is reached. If we cannot conclude an extension or a new license agreement beyond April 9, 2007, Nokia's rights to sell subscriber products under most of our patents will expire, as will our rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia's patents. We intend to pursue and obtain injunctions against Nokia's sales as well as damages (which will include interest from the date of infringement) for Nokia's unlicensed sales after April 9, 2007. We will continue to work with Nokia to see if we can reach agreement by April 9, 2007 on terms which we find acceptable but little progress has been made to date. If we are unable to reach agreement, we will aggressively pursue all our legal and business options and assume that Nokia will do likewise.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or
 
will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
The Company's management uses pro forma cash flow information including marketable securities to analyze increases and decreases in certain of its liquid assets, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management views certain marketable securities as liquid assets available on short notice to fund operations, acquisitions, strategic initiatives, stock repurchases and dividends even though these marketable securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." The GAAP statements of cash flows present the purchases and sales of marketable securities as inflows and outflows. For internal analysis of the Company's cash position, management does not view these transactions as inflows and outflows from the business, but as cash management transactions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP presentation is a helpful and practical measure of the Company's liquidity.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
 
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA-based networks and CDMA-based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA-based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; developments in current and future litigation; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election Of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On November 27, 2006, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company"), the Committee approved the terms of the 2007 Annual Bonus Program (the "Bonus Program") applicable to key employees of the Company, including the Company's executive officers. The design of the Bonus Program is similar to the Company's 2006, 2005 and other prior year programs, and all such programs reward achievement at specified levels of financial and individual performance.
     Under the Bonus Program each officer position has an assigned base target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year-end annual salary. Each officer position also has an assigned "stretch" target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year-end annual salary. The target bonus levels are competitive with target bonuses for similar positions reported in independent, third-party published surveys reviewed by the Committee. Depending on Company and business unit financial performance and individual performance, each officer may earn between 0% and 312.5% of the stretch target. Two components comprise the fundamental design of the Bonus Program:

EXHIBIT 99.1
     This Amendment to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is entered into as of December 7, 2006 by and between Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Computershare Investor Services LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company ("Rights Agent"), with respect to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of September 26, 2005 (the "Agreement").
Qualcomm
     WHEREAS, Section 27 of the Agreement permits the Company to amend the Agreement to make any provisions with respect to the Rights which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, such amendment to be evidenced by a writing signed by the Company and the Rights Agent; and
     WHEREAS, after thorough and careful consideration, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to amend the Agreement, among other things, to revise the definition of Acquiring Person and the events triggering a distribution of the Rights; and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Rights Agent are entering into this Amendment to reflect the changes to the Rights and the Agreement set forth below.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth , the parties hereby agree as follows:
     1. .
Amendments to the Agreement
          1.1. Section 1(a) of the Agreement is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates (as such terms are hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after
"Acquiring Person"
provided, however,
 
such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Incumbent Board of Directors of the Company (as hereinafter defined) determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), has become such inadvertently, and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement."
          1.2. Section 3(a) of the Agreement is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
"Until the earlier of (i) the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) to commence, a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of Common Shares aggregating 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (including any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights, the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the ""), (x) the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the Rights (and the right to receive Right Certificates therefor) will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (a ""), evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held. As of the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates."
Distribution Date
Right Certificate
          1.3. Section 27 of the Agreement is amended by replacing the second sentence with the following:
"Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person amend this Agreement to (a) lower the thresholds set forth in Sections 1(a) and 3(a) hereof from 20% to any percentage which is (i) greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known by the Company to be beneficially owned by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company,
 
any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) and (ii) not less than 10% or (b) increase the Purchase Price for each one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share provided above in Section 7(b)."
     2. . Capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Definitions; Effect on Agreement
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 24, 2007, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2006. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management excluding the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company's management uses free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
QUALCOMM Contact: John Gilbert Vice President of Investor and Industry Analyst Relations 1-(858) 658-4813 (ph) 1-(858) 651-9303 (fax) e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  January 24, 2007  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended December 31, 2006.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) First Quarter Results
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
QUALCOMM Pro Forma First Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results, and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at .
www.qualcomm.com
"Our results this quarter were driven by record 3G handset and chipset shipments," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "The worldwide migration to CDMA-based technologies is accelerating as we continue to execute with our partners to drive innovations into the marketplace."
"An increasing number of subscribers and enterprise customers are benefiting from 3G's higher data rates enabling new applications including multimedia, 3D gaming, downloadable navigation and access to the wireless Internet. It is evident that the innovation and competition our business model enables has benefited wireless consumers, operators and manufacturers globally."
"Based on our current outlook for CDMA-based handset shipments, we are pleased to reaffirm our calendar year 2007 forecast which represents approximately 28% year-over-year growth. We are also reaffirming our most recent fiscal 2007 revenue and pro forma diluted earnings per share guidance as adjusted by our recently announced acquisitions."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $10.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $9.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2006 and $9.4 billion a year ago. On January 12, 2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per common share payable on March 30, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2007.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $87 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $82 million, or $0.05 per share in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 34 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multi-mode, multi-band, multi-network products and technologies.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 68 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in legal fees and employee related expenses. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2007 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 21 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and 25 percent for QUALCOMM pro forma, compared to fiscal 2006 effective income tax rates of 22 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and 26 percent for QUALCOMM pro forma. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the federal research and development tax credit that expired on December 31, 2005 was extended by Congress for a period of two years beyond the prior expiration date. We recorded a tax benefit of $33 million, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, related to fiscal 2006 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 due to this retroactive extension. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) was 17%, primarily as a result of this benefit. Our first quarter fiscal 2007 QUALCOMM pro forma results exclude this tax benefit attributable to fiscal 2006.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 include $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2007 QSI results included $42 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business
 
outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors.
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the second fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2007 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.
Our license agreement with Nokia Corp. expires in part on April 9, 2007, with Nokia having an option exercisable through the end of 2008 to extend the agreement. The table includes a footnote to size our estimate of the risk, approximately $0.04 to $0.06 diluted earnings per share, of Nokia not paying royalties in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments. Nokia has publicly stated that they intend to continue to use our patents but not pay royalties after the expiration of their rights under those patents on April 9, 2007 should a new license agreement (or extension of the existing agreement) not be reached by that time. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we will be unable to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales until a court awards damages or agreement with Nokia is reached. If we cannot conclude an extension or a new license agreement beyond April 9, 2007, Nokia's rights to sell certain subscriber products (such as cellular phones and wireless personal digital assistant devices) under most of our patents will expire, as will our rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia's patents. We intend to pursue and obtain injunctions against Nokia's sales as well as damages (which will include interest from the date of infringement) for Nokia's unlicensed sales after April 9, 2007. While we will continue to work with Nokia to see if we can reach an agreement, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully resolve this matter before April 9, 2007 on terms which we find acceptable and little progress has been made to date. If we are unable to reach agreement, and Nokia continues to use our unlicensed intellectual property, we will aggressively pursue all our legal and business options and assume that Nokia will do likewise.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D expense. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value
 
of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as it is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D expense in fiscal 2006 is excluded because such expense is incurred infrequently and is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to
 
risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA-based networks and CDMA-based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA-based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On April 25, 2007, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second quarter ended April 1, 2007. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
          The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
          The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
          The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
          The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

"We are pleased to report that the 3G CDMA-based market continues to grow at a rapid pace. Our results reflect strong year-over-year growth in CDMA2000 and WCDMA chipsets and handsets driving record revenue and earnings per share," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "Based on our current outlook, thanks primarily to stronger than expected chipset demand across our product portfolio and higher CDMA2000 handset shipments, we are raising our fiscal 2007 revenue and earnings per share guidance."
"Focused execution by QUALCOMM and its partners resulted in many exciting achievements this quarter. The MediaFLO USA service was commercially launched by Verizon Wireless and AT&T/Cingular announced their plan to launch services later this year. The GSM Association selected LG's phone, powered by a QUALCOMM chipset, as the 3G for All' winner to enable feature rich WCDMA handsets at lower prices. In addition, we announced the expansion of our single chip product line to include EV-DO Rev. A, providing a low cost mobile broadband solution. The innovation and competition enabled by our business model continues to provide manufacturers, operators and subscribers compelling devices, applications and services globally."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $10.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and $10.2 billion a year ago. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we
 
Page 3 of 17
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
announced a 17 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.14 per share. A cash dividend of $0.14 per share is payable on June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2007.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $84 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $78 million, or $0.05 per share in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 23 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multi-mode, multi-band, multi-network products and technologies. QSI R&D expenses are primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Page 4 of 17
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 60 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in legal fees, employee related expenses and bad debt expense. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate is estimated to be 21 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP), consistent with our prior estimate. The second quarter tax rate of 22 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) is higher than the estimated annual effective income tax rate due primarily to $33 million of tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit. Our fiscal 2007 QUALCOMM pro forma effective income tax rate is estimated to be 24 percent, compared to our previous estimate of 25 percent. This decrease in our pro forma estimated annual rate is primarily due to an increase in forecasted earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 include $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 QSI results included $50 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors.

QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2007 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.
Our third quarter and fiscal 2007 guidance includes the anticipated positive impact to QTL revenue resulting from an arbitration decision in April 2007 in our favor against Ericsson and Sony Ericsson for underpaying royalties to us under the terms of the license agreement with us. Under the arbitration order, we will receive $30 million for subscriber unit sales from 2004 through the first quarter of calendar 2006. In addition, royalty payments from the first quarter of calendar 2006 to the present, and going forward, will be made in accordance with the arbitrators' decision providing a positive impact on revenues and earnings.
We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp. including litigation over Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not expect to be able to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. We had previously estimated the potential impact of non-payment of royalties from Nokia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments to be approximately $0.04 to $0.06 diluted earnings per share. Our current estimate of royalties which we believe will be owed from Nokia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments is approximately $0.04 to $0.05 diluted earnings per share, which we have excluded from our current fiscal 2007 guidance.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's
 
Page 10 of 17

operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA-based networks and CDMA-based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation

and arbitration proceedings as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA-based products, services or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 25, 2007, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third quarter ended July 1, 2007. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

SAN DIEGO  July 25, 2007  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced record results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ended July 1, 2007.
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) Third Quarter Results
Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
QUALCOMM Pro Forma Third Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.

"We had another tremendous quarter, providing market validation for the innovative products and solutions delivered by our employees and partners worldwide," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "The fundamental drivers of our business remain very strong," continued Dr. Jacobs. "Our record revenue and earnings this quarter reflect continued worldwide demand for innovative third- generation devices and services. We shipped a record 65 million CDMA-based MSM chipsets in the third quarter representing strong year-over-year growth in both 1xEV-DO and WCDMA. Strong
 
March quarter handset shipments demonstrate the continued global adoption of CDMA-based technologies with over 30% growth from the year ago quarter."
"In addition to continued excellent business and financial performance, we also see traction for our initiatives to expand the wireless market. Multiple WCDMA operators have adopted the BREW platform, our MediaFLO system continues to grow as we expand our service footprint in the United States and conduct new trials around the world, and our Snapdragon processor is building momentum in the computing and consumer electronics markets."
"While we continue to execute well and the future of CDMA-based technology is very bright, we are also expending a great amount of time and resources defending our business model. In the most recent quarter, we have made progress in some of these battles, while losing ground in others. We were disappointed with the rulings on behalf of Broadcom, both in the California litigation and in front of the ITC. We continue to believe that the rulings were wrong and are pursuing all avenues to reverse and mitigate the effect of those rulings, including working with our partners who may obtain a license from Broadcom. While we are increasing our guidance for the year, ITC and litigation outcomes are uncertain and could have a material impact on our business and results of operations."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $12.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $11.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and $9.5 billion a year ago. As of July 1, 2007, $2.6 billion remains authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. On July 13, 2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share payable on September 28, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2007.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 includes estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $76 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $83 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
 
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 20 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multi-mode, multi-band, multi-network products and technologies. QSI R&D expenses are related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 43 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in costs related to litigation and other legal matters and employee related expenses. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA cooperative marketing expenses.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate is estimated to be 19 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) compared to our prior estimate of 21 percent. Our fiscal 2007 QUALCOMM pro forma effective income tax rate is estimated to be 23 percent, compared to our previous estimate of 24 percent. The third quarter QUALCOMM (GAAP) and pro forma effective tax rates of 18 percent
 
and 21 percent, respectively, are lower than the expected annual effective tax rates primarily due to our estimate of additional foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 include $0.04 loss per share for the QSI segment. The third quarter of fiscal 2007 QSI results include $95 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, asset impairments or the impact of the resolution of income tax audits, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. In addition, our outlook provides for legal costs which are reasonably consistent with our experience over the past year but does not include any provision for the consequences of injunctions or significant damages or costs related to litigation matters, including support we may agree to provide to our customers. Although Verizon announced it has entered into a license agreement with Broadcom eliminating risk of not being able to import handsets using our chips for use in Verizon's network, a comprehensive settlement between us and Broadcom is unlikely given Broadcom's insistence on terms which could have a material impact on our licensing business. As a result, over the next few months, we will be defending ourselves from Broadcom's attempts to obtain an injunction precluding the sale of certain of our chips sold in handsets for use in the U.S. other than in Verizon's network.
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2007 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.
We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp., including litigation over Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not expect to be able to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the
 
disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. Our estimate of royalties which we believe will be owed by Nokia in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 for June quarter shipments is approximately $0.05 diluted earnings per share, which we have excluded from our current fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2007 guidance, compared to our prior estimate of approximately $0.04 to $0.05 diluted earnings per share.
 
     The following estimates are approximations and are based on the current business outlook:
Sums may not equal totals due to rounding.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to
 
change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of development, deployment and commercial acceptance of CDMA-based networks and CDMA-based technology, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and
 
the costs we incur in connection therewith; fluctuations in the demand for CDMA-based products, services or applications; outcomes of audits by taxing authorities; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On November 8, 2007, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

"We delivered another record performance in fiscal 2007 because our employees and partners continue to provide industry leading innovative wireless products and services," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "We achieved record revenues, net income and operating cash flow and returned a record $2.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through our cash dividend and stock repurchase programs."
"In addition to our strong business and financial performance, our focused execution resulted in many significant achievements in fiscal 2007. More than 530 million wireless subscribers are now benefiting from the widespread and accelerating availability of 3G CDMA mobile broadband networks with advanced wireless devices at competitive prices. We shipped a record 253 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chips, a 22% year-over-year increase, and for the second quarter in a row we were named the world's top supplier of semiconductors for wireless applications by iSuppli. We continued to expand our chipset portfolio with the addition of the 7000 series platform for high performance wireless devices and a low cost single chip for EV-DO Rev. A mobile broadband."
"In close partnership with the world's leading content providers, our MediaFLO mobile TV service is now commercially available in the United States and in trials around the world. With ground breaking innovations, such as MediaFLO, Snapdragon and Gobi, and by partnering with new market entrants, such as Google and Skype, Qualcomm is expanding the impact of 3G CDMA beyond traditional products, services and partners."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Qualcomm's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $12.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and $9.9 billion a year ago. As of September 30, 2007, $1.5 billion remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program. From October 1, 2007 through November 7, 2007, we repurchased and retired 13 million shares of our common stock for approximately $525 million. On October 11, 2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per
 
share payable on January 4, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2007.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $78 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to $76 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 21 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost phones, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 5 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, employee related expenses and other professional fees, partially offset by a gain on the sale of a building. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate for total Qualcomm (GAAP) was 9 percent, and our fiscal 2007 pro forma effective tax rate was 22 percent. Our total Qualcomm (GAAP) diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2007 included a $0.20 benefit as a result of prior year tax audits completed during the fourth fiscal quarter. This benefit resulted in a negative tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for total Qualcomm (GAAP). Fourth quarter fiscal 2007 Qualcomm pro forma results excluded this $0.20 diluted earnings per share benefit to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 included $0.02 loss per share for the QSI segment. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 QSI results included $63 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items. In addition, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages or costs related to litigation matters unless damages have been awarded by a court.
 
We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp., including arbitration over Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we are not recording royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales after April 9, 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. We have excluded from our fiscal 2008 revenue and earnings guidance our estimate of royalties which we believe Nokia is required to report and pay to us under our existing license agreement in fiscal 2008 of approximately $0.25-$0.30 diluted earnings per share.
We perform periodic audits of the royalties payable by our licensees. As a result of our audit process, we determined during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that total CDMA-based handset unit shipments and average selling prices (ASPs) should be adjusted for certain periods. The adjustments related only to handset shipments and ASPs and did not impact the amount or timing of our revenue. Based on this new information, we now estimate shipments of 89 million handsets reported in our fourth quarter fiscal 2007, compared to our previous estimate of 92 million handsets. The estimated ASP for such units remains unchanged from our prior guidance of $218. A summary of the adjustments on prior periods is included on our Investor Relations website .

The following table summarizes total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma guidance for the first fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2008 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented in a manner that is consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.

Qualcomm Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., Qualcomm is included in the S&P
 
500 Index and is a 2007 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax items related to
 
prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment of our technologies in wireless networks and of 3G wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; fluctuations in the demand for products, services or applications based on our technologies; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our
 
ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 23, 2008, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2007. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

Detailed reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma results and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on our Investor Relations web page at .

"We are pleased to report another strong quarter as the demand for CDMA-based devices, applications and services continues to accelerate around the world," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "We continue to work closely with our partners to successfully provide the innovative wireless products and services consumers demand. Our results reflect another record quarter of chipset shipments and a 21 percent year-over-year growth in both revenues and pro forma earnings per share."
"Our continued focus on execution allows us to deliver excellent financial results despite the impact of defending our business model. The fundamental drivers of our business remain strong, and based on our current business outlook, we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal 2008 pro forma earnings per share guidance."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Qualcomm's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.3 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $11.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and $10.5 billion a year ago. As of December 30, 2007, $670 million remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of a put option outstanding which could require us to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $94 million. Since December 30, 2007, we have repurchased and retired more than 17.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $668 million. On January 16, 2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share payable on March 28, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 29, 2008.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $85 million or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to $87 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 18 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9 percent year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in employee related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2008 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 17 percent for total Qualcomm (GAAP) and 21 percent for Qualcomm pro forma, consistent with our prior guidance. The first quarter Qualcomm (GAAP) and pro forma effective tax rates of 18 percent and 22 percent, respectively, are higher than the expected annual effective tax rates primarily due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 included $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2008 QSI results included $66 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially
 
from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items. In addition, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages or costs related to litigation matters unless damages have been awarded by a court.
We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp., including arbitration over Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we are not recording royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales after April 9, 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. We have excluded from our fiscal 2008 revenue and earnings guidance our estimate of royalties which we believe Nokia is required to report and pay to us under our existing license agreement in fiscal 2008.
We continue to be engaged in litigation with Broadcom Corporation in various forums. On December 31, 2007, the Federal District Court in Santa Ana, California issued an injunction as to certain of our products, while enjoining but mandating a limited license with respect to other products. We continue the effort to design products to avoid the claims of the patents found by the jury to infringe Broadcom's patents. We have already announced that we expect devices to be available before the end of the first calendar quarter of 2008 that incorporate our chipsets which do not include the accused function of the 6,847,686 patent. We have filed a motion for stay and a motion asking that the judge clarify certain portions of his ruling, and we intend to appeal the adverse findings in this case. We have included our estimate of the impact of this ruling in our outlook for fiscal 2008.
The following table summarizes total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma guidance for the second fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2008 based on the current business outlook.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma
 
measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition,
 
management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment of our technologies in wireless networks and of 3G wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; fluctuations in the demand for products, services or applications based on our technologies; our dependence on major customers and licensees; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may pursue; our dependence on third party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: John Gilbert Vice President of Investor and Industry Analyst Relations 1-858-658-4813 (ph) 1-858-651-9303 (fax) e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  April 23, 2008  Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced results for the second fiscal quarter of 2008 ended March 30, 2008.
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) Second Quarter Results
Total Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
-more-
 
Qualcomm Pro Forma Second Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Detailed reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma results and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"We delivered another strong quarter as worldwide adoption of 3G CDMA-based products and services continues to accelerate," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "Together with our partners, our ongoing focus on innovation, execution and quality provides compelling solutions for the global wireless market. Our financial results reflect another record quarter of both MSM chipset and CDMA-based device shipments."
"We continue to execute on our strategic objectives and are pleased to see positive momentum in the marketplace. Our Gobi mobile internet solution, which provides ubiquitous connection to mobile operator networks worldwide, has been accepted by leading notebook manufacturers, and our Snapdragon platform has multiple design wins with several customers. MediaFLO USA continues its network deployment and FLO-TV will soon be offered by the two largest U.S. operators. We announced a partnership with Citi Cards that brings the total to four of the top 10 banks in the U.S. now taking advantage of the Firethorn solution. The fundamental drivers of our
 
business remain strong, and based on the current business outlook, we are raising fiscal 2008 revenue and earnings per share guidance."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Qualcomm's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $10.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $11.3 billion at both the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the year ago quarter. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.14 to $0.16 per share. On April 10, 2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 27, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2008.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $88 million or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to $84 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
 
N/M  Not Meaningful
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 28 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband,
 
multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 11 percent year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees and employee-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2008 effective income tax rate is estimated to be 16 percent for total Qualcomm (GAAP) compared to our prior estimate of 17 percent provided on January 23, 2008. Our fiscal 2008 Qualcomm pro forma effective income tax rate is estimated to be 20 percent compared with our prior estimate of 21 percent. The second quarter total Qualcomm (GAAP) and pro forma effective tax rates of 15 percent and 19 percent, respectively, are lower than the estimated annual effective tax rates primarily due to the change in our annual estimate of foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 included a $0.02 loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2008 QSI results included $76 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
 
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items. In addition, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages or costs related to litigation matters, unless damages have been awarded by a court.
During the second quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with Nokia Corp. to consolidate the arbitration we had filed against Nokia into the pre-existing litigation in Delaware originally filed by Nokia. That case now addresses, among other things, our dispute with Nokia regarding Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result of the dispute, under generally accepted accounting principles, we are not recording royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales after April 9, 2007 until a court awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. We have excluded from our fiscal 2008 revenue and earnings guidance our estimate of royalties which we believe Nokia is required to report and pay to us under our existing license agreement in fiscal 2008.
In late 2004, we discovered that Ericsson and Sony Ericsson were underreporting and underpaying royalties to us for sales of subscriber units under the license agreement between Ericsson and us. In March 2008, the parties resolved the dispute as to both past and future sales. As part of the settlement, the parties have dismissed the arbitration addressing this dispute. The terms of the settlement are consistent with our prior financial guidance.
We continue to be engaged in litigation with Broadcom Corporation in various forums. On December 31, 2007, the Federal District Court in Santa Ana, Calif. issued an injunction as to certain of our products, while enjoining but mandating a limited license with respect to other products. We continue the effort to design products to avoid the claims of the patents found by the jury to infringe
 
Broadcom's patents. We have introduced chipsets ready for commercial-production devices that do not include the accused function of the 6,847,686 patent. We are appealing the adverse findings in this case on an expedited schedule. We have included our estimate of the impact of this ruling in our outlook for fiscal 2008.
The following table summarizes total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2008 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented in a manner that is consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.

Qualcomm Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., Qualcomm is included in the S&P
 
500 Index and is a 2008 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the
 
Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment of our technologies in wireless networks and of 3G wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; fluctuations in the demand for products, services or applications based on our technologies; our dependence on major customers and licensees; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions the Company has or may
 
pursue; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in the Company's SEC reports.

     On July 23, 2008, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2008. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

SAN DIEGO  July 23, 2008  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM) today announced results for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 ended June 29, 2008.
Qualcomm's third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call has been re-scheduled to Thursday, July 24, 2008, beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (5:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time). Conference call details are included herein.
Total Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) Third Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Qualcomm Pro Forma Third Quarter Results
-more-
 
Detailed reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma results and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"We are pleased to report another strong quarter as the migration to 3G-enabled products continues to accelerate," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "We delivered record revenues, up 19 percent year-over-year, and our pro forma earnings per share were at the high end of our prior estimate.
"I am also pleased to announce that we have reached a settlement agreement with Nokia that resolves all litigation between the companies and will allow both of us to focus our efforts on driving the global 3G and 4G markets forward. In addition to providing an up-front royalty payment and other benefits, Qualcomm will also receive on-going royalties for all CDMA standards, as well as single-mode OFDMA. I look forward to providing our updated guidance tomorrow morning."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Qualcomm's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $10.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and $12.3 billion a year ago. On July 16, 2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on September 26, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 29, 2008.
 
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $94 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. This compares to $76 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Research and Development
 
N/M  Not Meaningful
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 29 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless technologies with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 16 percent year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in certain professional fees, primarily related to patent activities, and employee-related expenses. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Without the potential effect of our settlement with Nokia, our fiscal 2008 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 16 percent for total Qualcomm (GAAP) and 19 percent for Qualcomm pro forma. The third quarter total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma effective tax rates of 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively, are lower than the estimated annual effective tax rates primarily due to the change in our estimate of foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 included a $0.04 loss per share for the QSI segment. The third quarter of fiscal 2008 QSI results included $88 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.

Editor's Note: To view the web slides that accompany this earnings release and conference call, please go to the Qualcomm Investor Relations website at http://investor.qualcomm.com/results.cfm.
Qualcomm Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA and other advanced technologies. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., Qualcomm is included in the S&P
 
500 Index and is a 2008 FORTUNE 500 company traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol QCOM.
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the
 
Company. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment of our technologies in wireless networks and of 3G wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; fluctuations in the demand for products, services or applications based on our technologies; our
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
dependence on major customers and licensees; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions we have or may pursue; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports.

     On November 6, 2008, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 28, 2008. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: John Gilbert Phone: 1-858 658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  November 6, 2008  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies and data solutions, today announced results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended September 28, 2008.
For comparison purposes, we note the following unique items:
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) Results
Total Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Fourth Quarter
 
Fiscal 2008
Qualcomm Pro Forma Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Fourth Quarter
Fiscal 2008
 
Detailed reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma results and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"I am very pleased with the performance of our businesses this past year, particularly the strong execution of our chipset business and our successful settlement with Nokia. While we continue to see strong growth in 3G CDMA, the current macroeconomic conditions and potential for further economic slowdown creates an uncertain business environment for the next few quarters," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "As a result of the credit crisis and the economic uncertainty, our guidance reflects slower end-market device growth for 2009 than previously anticipated and a significant contraction in channel inventory in the first and second fiscal quarters. While we are estimating strong growth for CDMA-based devices in calendar year 2009, driven by a shift to emerging markets, this growth is meaningfully less than we would have forecast just a few weeks ago."
"Although the full impact of the current economic environment is impossible to predict, our balance sheet remains strong and our business operations continue to generate strong cash flow. Our investments in innovative research and development programs, such as Snapdragon, Gobi, mobile TV, mobile commerce and next-generation technologies continue to grow our industry-leading product and intellectual property portfolio and open up exciting new markets for future growth. We are well positioned to navigate through these uncertain times and will continue to focus on our long-term strategic objectives."
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $11.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and $11.8 billion a year ago. In October 2008, we received a non-refundable payment of $2.5 billion related to new license and settlement agreements with Nokia. On October 22, 2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on January 7, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 11, 2008.
There has been a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets that has depressed securities values, and our investments in marketable securities have been impacted. As a result, during the quarter ended September 28, 2008, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments on marketable securities of $327 million, which is approximately 3 percent of the recorded value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at September 28, 2008. In addition, at September 28, 2008 and October 31, 2008, we had net unrealized losses on marketable securities of $347 million and $1.26 billion, respectively.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 29 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless technologies with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 40 percent year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 combined with the impact of a gain on the sale of a building in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2008 effective income tax rate for total Qualcomm (GAAP) was 17 percent compared with our prior estimate of 16 percent. Our fiscal 2008 pro forma effective tax rate was 20 percent compared with our prior estimate of 19 percent. The fiscal 2008 total Qualcomm (GAAP) and pro forma effective tax rates are higher than our prior estimates primarily due to increased income taxed at the United States federal rate.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 included a $0.05 loss per share for the QSI segment. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 QSI results included $102 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
The recent financial disruption affecting the banking system and financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in fixed income, credit and equity markets. The resulting credit crisis has
 
depressed global economic conditions which have the potential to adversely affect our operating results by lowering consumer demand for CDMA-based devices.
In addition, the financial disruption has, and may continue to have, an impact on the value of our marketable securities portfolio and net investment income. Given unprecedented daily market volatility and the significant judgments involved, accurately forecasting other-than-temporary impairments associated with our marketable securities portfolio is extremely difficult and actual results could vary materially. While we do not forecast impairments, our net unrealized losses on marketable securities have increased to $1.26 billion at October 31, 2008, and portions of that amount could be impaired in future periods if market conditions do not improve.
Our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages related to litigation matters, unless damages or injunctions have been awarded by a court. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
We entered into new license and settlement agreements with Nokia that cover GSM/GPRS/EDGE, CDMA2000, WCDMA (including HSPA), TD-SCDMA, OFDMA (including LTE, UMB and WiMAX) and other products and resolve all pending litigation between the parties. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recognized $560 million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) in licensing and royalty revenues as a result of the execution of the agreements. Consideration provided to us under the new license agreement with Nokia included, among other things, a non-refundable up-front payment of $2.5 billion, ongoing royalties and the assignment of patents that we recorded in intangible assets in the amount of $1.8 billion. At September 28, 2008, unearned revenues included $3.9 billion related to upfront consideration that resulted from the execution of the new agreements that will be recognized over the remaining term of the license agreement of approximately 14 years. Beginning on the date the patents were assigned in October 2008, the intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately 15 years.
 
The following table summarizes total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma guidance for the first fiscal quarter and fiscal 2009 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.
 
The following estimates are approximations and are based on the current business outlook:

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm
 
Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition,
 
management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     (d) On December 8, 2008, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") appointed Mr. Thomas W. Horton to its Board of Directors. Mr. Horton was appointed for a term of office that expires at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Other than as set forth herein, there was not and is not any arrangement or understanding between Mr. Horton and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Horton was selected to be a director. Mr. Horton will receive compensation for his services as a non-employee director under the compensation program previously described in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 11, 2008.
Item 5.03 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
     (a) On December 8, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to Section 5 of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Section 5 Amendments"), which became effective immediately. The Section 5 Amendments are primarily intended to enhance the advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals to ensure such provisions are clear and unambiguous in light of recent Delaware case law developments and to require disclosure by a stockholder proponent of all ownership interests in the Company in light of increased use by investors of derivative instruments that are not reflected in an investor's beneficial ownership of the Company's securities. The Section 5 Amendments:
 
     The foregoing description of the changes effected by the Section 5 Amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of Section 5 as revised, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this current report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

     Section 5. .
Annual Meeting
          (a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose of election of Directors and for such other business as may lawfully come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 211(b)).
          (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought
 
before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at the corporation's principal executive offices not earlier than the 120th day, and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the anniversary of the date of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date of the prior year' s annual meeting as first specified in the corporation's notice of meeting (without regard to any postponements or adjournments of such meeting after such notice was first sent), notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the corporation. For purposes of these bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed or furnished by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement, or an adjournment or postponement, of a meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business, including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the bylaws of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and the names and addresses of the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf such business is being proposed, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose the business specified in the notice, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder and any such beneficial owner of such shares in such business, (v) the following information regarding the ownership interests of such stockholder and any such beneficial owner, which shall be supplemented by such stockholder in writing delivered to the Secretary of the corporation not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such interests as of the record date: (A) the class or series and the number of shares of the corporation which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and any such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder and any other direct
 
or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder has a right to vote any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation (for purposes of this bylaw a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner, and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household, and (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owners, if any, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings in connection with solicitations of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the corporation in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act of such stockholder's intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting and such proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. No business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
          (c) Subject to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of Directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). For nominations to be properly made at a meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, such notice must be received at the corporation's principal executive offices in accordance with the timeliness provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 5. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement, or an adjournment or postponement, of a meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of such notice by a stockholder. To be in proper form, such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares
 
of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such stockholder making the nomination and the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made and their respective affiliates and associates or others acting in concert therewith (naming such persons), on the one hand, and each proposed nominee and his or her respective affiliates and associates or others acting in concert therewith (naming such persons), on the other hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission if such stockholder making the nomination and any such beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of Item 404 of Regulation S-K and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice: (A) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder making such nomination and the names and addresses of the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (B) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to make the nomination specified in the notice, (C) the following information regarding the ownership interests of such stockholder and any such beneficial owner, which shall be supplemented by such stockholder in writing delivered to the Secretary of the corporation not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such interests as of the record date: (1) the class or series and the number of shares of the corporation which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and any such beneficial owner, (2) any Derivative Instrument directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (3) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder has a right to vote any shares of any security of the corporation, (4) any short interest in any security of the corporation (for purposes of this bylaw a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (5) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (6) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner, and (7) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household, and (D) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owners, if any, that would be required to be disclosed
 
in a proxy statement or other filings in connection with solicitations of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that any references in these bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or other proposals to be considered pursuant to this Section 5, and compliance with this Section 5 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other proposals at an annual meeting (other than, as provided in the third to last sentence of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, matters brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the 1934 Act). Nothing in this Section 5 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.
     Section 6. .
Special Meetings
          (a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, (iii) the President, or (iv) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized Directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption), and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix.
          (b) If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. If the notice is not given within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as
 
limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.
     Section 7. . Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, date and hour and of the meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229).
Notice of Meetings
     Section 8. . At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of Directors) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216).
Quorum
     Section 9. . Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares casting votes, excluding abstentions. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222(c)).
Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings
 
     Section 10. . For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote ay any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All elections of Directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 211(e), 212(b)).
Voting Rights
     Section 11. . If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 217(b)).
Joint Owners of Stock
     Section 12. . The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.

          (a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
          (c) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
 
record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 213).
     Section 38. . The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8; Sections 213(a), 219).
Registered Stockholders
     Section 39. . All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates (covered in Section 34), may be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signatures of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.
Execution of Other Securities
     Section 40. . Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to law at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 170, 173).
Declaration of Dividends
 
     Section 41. . Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 171).
Dividend Reserve
     Section 42. . The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Fiscal Year
     Section 43. .
Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees and Other Agents
          (a) . The corporation shall indemnify its Directors, Senior Officers and Vice Presidents who are designated as Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents or Group Presidents (collectively with the Senior Officers, the "") to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its Directors and Designated Officers; and, provided, further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Director or Designated Officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against the corporation or its Directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation or (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Directors and Executive Officers
Designated Officers
          (b) . The corporation shall have power to indemnify its officers other than Designated Officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
Junior Officers, Employees and Other Agents
          (c) .
Good Faith
               (1) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or Designated Officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
 
                    (i) one or more officers or employees of the corporation as to the matters the Director or Designated Officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
                    (ii) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or Designated Officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and
                    (iii) a committee of the Board of Directors upon which such Director or Designated Officer does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee such Director or Designated Officer believes to merit confidence;
so long as, in each case, the Director or Designated Officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
               (2) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
               (3) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
          (d) . The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or Designated Officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
          (e) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and Designated Officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or Designated Officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or
Enforcement
 
(ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
          (f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
          (g) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Rights
          (h) . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.
Insurance
          (i) . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
Amendments
          (j) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and Designated Officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
Saving Clause
          (k) . For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply:

               (4) References to a "Director," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving as a Director, officer, manager, employee, trustee or agent of (A) a subsidiary of the corporation of which the corporation holds equity securities constituting a majority of the voting power with respect to such subsidiary, or (B) at the request of the corporation, another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     Section 44. .

          (a) . Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, it shall be given in writing, timely and duly deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to his last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222).
Notice to Stockholders
 
          (b) . Any notice required to be given to any Director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by facsimile, telex, telegram, commercial courier service, personal delivery, telephone, voice message system or electronic transmission, except that such notice other than one which is delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such Director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such Director.
Notice to Directors
          (c) . If no address of a stockholder or Director be known, notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 hereof.

All notices given by mail or commercial courier service shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of dispatch, all notices by personal delivery or telephone shall be deemed to have been given as of receipt by the designee or a person accepting notice on behalf of such Director, and all notices given by facsimile, telex, telegram, voice message system or electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given as of the sending time recorded at the time of transmission.
Time Notices Deemed Given
          (f) . It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all Directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
Methods of Notice
          (g) . The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any Director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such Director to receive such notice.
Failure to Receive Notice
          (h) . Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this paragraph. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 230).
Notice to Person with Undeliverable Address
     Section 45. . Except as otherwise set forth in paragraph (i) of Section 43 of these Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock.

Such report shall include a balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon of independent accountants or, if there is no such report, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation. When there are more than 100 stockholders of record of the corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California Corporations Code, additional information as required by Section 1501(b) of the California Corporations Code shall also be contained in such report, provided that if the corporation has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, that Act shall take precedence.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 28, 2009, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2008. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income (loss), income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN DIEGO  January 28, 2009  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended December 28, 2008, noting that first quarter fiscal 2009 revenues were at the high end of prior guidance and operating income exceeded prior guidance. However, net income and diluted EPS for the quarter were adversely impacted by other-than-temporary impairments to its marketable securities portfolio.
Total Qualcomm (GAAP) First Quarter Results
Total Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 
Qualcomm Pro Forma First Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Detailed reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma results and cash flow are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"Despite weak economic conditions, wireless subscribers continue to migrate from second-generation to third-generation CDMA networks around the world. Our first quarter revenues
 
were at the high end of prior guidance and operating income exceeded our prior guidance driven primarily by the mix of higher-end chipsets, higher-priced data capable devices and improved expense management," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "I am particularly pleased to see healthy demand for 3G as CDMA-based device shipments in the September quarter were at the high end of our prior expectations and reflect more than 30 percent year-over-year growth. While our operating performance was strong, the distress in the global financial markets continued, resulting in additional impairments of our marketable securities portfolio."
"The CDMA inventory channel has contracted as we expected, and the business environment continues to remain uncertain. Reduced visibility in the marketplace makes it difficult to forecast future inventory levels or predict when a recovery will begin. As a result, while we continue to estimate healthy growth in the CDMA-device market, we have lowered our shipment estimate for calendar year 2009. Although we are not providing earnings per share guidance due to the volatility of financial markets and the impact it has had and may have on our investment portfolio and net income, we are providing revenue, operating income and our other standard guidance. Qualcomm is very fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and operating cash flows in these difficult times and we are committed to supporting our partners and driving the market forward."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $13.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared to $11.3 billion at both the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the year ago quarter. On January 16, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on March 27, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2009.
The distress in global financial markets has continued to suppress the value of our marketable securities portfolio. As a result, in evaluating the recorded values of our marketable securities at December 28, 2008, we determined that $388 million, or approximately 3 percent of the recorded values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, were other-than-temporarily impaired. In addition, at December 28, 2008 and January 23, 2009, we had net unrealized losses on marketable securities of $1.1 billion.
 
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 19 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless technologies with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. QSI R&D expenses were related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 1 percent year-over-year due to a decrease in costs related to litigation and legal matters partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
 
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2009 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 22 percent for total Qualcomm (GAAP) and 25 percent for Qualcomm pro forma. The first quarter total Qualcomm (GAAP) effective tax rate of 24 percent is higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate primarily due to amounts recorded during the quarter for a valuation allowance on capital losses, partially offset by a tax benefit related to fiscal 2008 as a result of the retroactive reenactment of the federal R&D credit.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary. Total Qualcomm (GAAP) results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 included a $0.05 loss per share for the QSI segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2009 QSI results included $102 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
The continuing global financial crisis and the resulting slowdown in the worldwide economy is causing contraction in the CDMA-based channel inventory, resulting in lower demand for CDMA-based MSM integrated circuits, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results. In addition, the financial crisis has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the value of our marketable securities portfolio and net investment income (loss), including other-than-temporary impairments in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. While we do not forecast impairments, we do have net unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized in future periods if market conditions do not improve. Given the unprecedented daily market volatility and the significant judgments involved, accurately forecasting other-than-temporary impairments associated with our marketable securities portfolio is extremely difficult and actual results could vary materially. As a result, while we are providing revenue, operating income and our other standard guidance, we are not providing earnings per share guidance.
 
Moreover, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages related to litigation matters, unless damages or injunctions have been awarded by a court. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes total Qualcomm (GAAP) and Qualcomm pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm
 
Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income(loss), income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
 
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total Qualcomm (GAAP) results and Qualcomm pro forma results and between total Qualcomm (GAAP) cash flow and Qualcomm pro forma cash flow are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment of our technologies in wireless networks and of 3G wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; the current uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and our marketable securities portfolio; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on major customers and licensees; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions we have or may pursue; our dependence on third-party
 
manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the MediaFLO USA network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports.

Exhibit 99.1
Qualcomm has rescheduled its second quarter earnings call to Monday, April 27, 2009 at 5:00 a.m. PT.
The Company is postponing its earnings release and call until Monday, April 27, 2009 due to advanced settlement discussions with Broadcom regarding a global settlement of all disputes between the parties which if reached, would have an impact on the Company's financial results for the fiscal second quarter.  No assurance can be given that the Company and Broadcom will be able to reach agreement on the terms of a global settlement.  Neither company will comment further at this time.
Revenue and operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, excluding the potential impact of the Broadcom agreement, met or exceeded prior guidance. Further details on the Company's second fiscal quarter results and full fiscal year guidance will be provided in the earnings release and conference call.
Except for the impact of this agreement, the Company had completed all of its period ending accounting processes and procedures necessary to report its second fiscal quarter results.   
Qualcomm remains in its quiet period and Qualcomm Investor Relations representatives will not be available to return phone calls until after the conclusion of the conference call. Questions during the live call will be taken from investment professionals only.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 27, 2009, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: John Gilbert Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  April 27, 2009  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended March 29, 2009. While second quarter fiscal 2009 revenues were at the high end of prior guidance, strong operating results were offset by costs related to a settlement and patent agreement with Broadcom Corporation. In addition, results for the quarter were adversely impacted by other-than-temporary impairments to marketable securities.
Second Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
Pro Forma Second Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"Global demand for 3G-enabled products and services remains strong despite the current economic environment," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm. "Our second quarter revenues were at the high end of prior guidance, and I am pleased with the strong operating performance of our business. The recent settlement with Broadcom will resolve all pending litigation between the parties, and while this settlement adversely impacted our second quarter results, eliminating uncertainty, employee distraction and cost related to protracted litigation is a positive for our stockholders, customers, partners and the wireless industry."
"While the business environment remains uncertain and the continued distress in global financial markets resulted in additional impairments to our marketable securities, we believe the CDMA inventory channel has stabilized, and we are seeing some replenishment of products driven primarily by emerging markets.  We continue to grow key research and development programs to further our technology leadership and drive future growth, while closely managing SG&A expenses.  Demand for CDMA-based products and services remains healthy, and our calendar year 2009 device shipment estimate remains unchanged."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $14.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared to $13.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and $10.6 billion a year ago. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.16 to $0.17 per share. On April 8, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, payable on June 26, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 29, 2009.
The distress in global financial markets has continued to affect the value of our marketable securities. As a result, we determined that $204 million, or approximately 1 percent of the recorded values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 29, 2009, were other-than-temporarily impaired. In addition, at March 29, 2009 and April 17, 2009, we had net unrealized losses on marketable securities of $898 million and $634 million, respectively.
 
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 7 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were related to our FLO TV subsidiary, formerly MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 13 percent year-over-year, a majority of which is due to cost reduction activities. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to FLO TV.
Litigation Settlement
The second quarter of fiscal 2009 operating expenses included a $748 million litigation settlement charge related to a settlement and patent agreement with Broadcom. The agreement provides for the
 
receipt of certain assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and will resolve all pending litigation between the parties.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2009 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 35 percent for GAAP and 31 percent for pro forma.  The second quarter effective tax rates of negative 186 percent for GAAP and 131 percent for pro forma differ from the annual rates due to the impact of the discrete tax benefit related to the litigation settlement charge associated with the settlement and patent agreement with Broadcom at a rate less than the United States federal rate. In addition, the second quarter GAAP effective tax rate differs from the estimated annual effective tax rate due to amounts recorded during the quarter to adjust our net deferred tax assets to reflect the future impact of California budget legislation enacted February 20, 2009.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including our FLO TV subsidiary.  GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 included a $0.03 loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2009 QSI results included $86 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
We expect the global financial crisis and resulting slowdown in the worldwide economy to continue to cause lower demand for CDMA-based products in various regions. We expect a greater mix of lower-priced CDMA-based products for emerging markets to impact our financial results for the second half of fiscal 2009 as compared to the second half of fiscal 2008. In addition, the financial crisis has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income (loss). While we do not forecast impairments, we do have unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized in future periods if market conditions do not improve. Given the unprecedented daily market
 
volatility and the significant judgments involved, accurately forecasting other-than-temporary impairments associated with our marketable securities is extremely difficult and actual results could vary materially. As a result, while we are providing revenue, operating income and our other standard guidance, we are not providing earnings per share guidance.
Moreover, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions or significant possible damages related to litigation matters, unless damages or injunctions have been awarded by a court. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast.  Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items. 
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income (loss), income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 22, 2009, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled
 
measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: John Gilbert Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  July 22, 2009  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended June 28, 2009.
Third Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
Pro Forma Third Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
"We delivered a strong quarter as the worldwide migration to 3G-enabled products and services remains robust," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Our revenues were at the high end of our prior guidance, and our operating income exceeded our prior guidance. Our financial results reflect a record quarter for MSM chipset shipments, strong licensing and royalty revenues based on healthy end market demand in the March quarter and a 5 percent year-over-year reduction in combined R&D and SG&A expenses."
 
"Despite the global economic uncertainty, we anticipate another strong quarter for our chipset shipments in the fourth fiscal quarter. We believe the CDMA inventory channel has largely stabilized, yet remains near historically low levels consistent with our prior forecast. We are raising our fiscal 2009 revenue and operating income estimates given the strong underlying fundamentals of our business."
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $15.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009, compared to $14.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and $11.2 billion a year ago. On July 8, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, payable on September 25, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 28, 2009.
We recorded net other-than-temporary impairments of $112 million, or approximately one percent of the recorded values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 28, 2009. Our net unrealized losses on marketable securities decreased by $873 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2009, due primarily to recent improvements in financial markets. As of June 28, 2009, we had net unrealized losses on marketable securities of $25 million as compared to $898 million as of March 29, 2009.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 6 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 20 percent year-over-year, primarily due to lower litigation-related activities and cost reduction efforts. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to FLO TV.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2009 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 33 percent for GAAP and 29 percent for pro forma. The third quarter effective tax rate of 25 percent for both GAAP and pro forma differ from the annual rates due to a $748 million pre-tax litigation settlement charge recorded in the second fiscal quarter with a discrete tax benefit computed at a rate less than the United States federal rate.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including our FLO TV subsidiary. GAAP results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 included a $0.02 loss per share for the QSI segment. The third quarter of fiscal 2009 QSI results included $86 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
 
We expect that the uncertainty in the worldwide economy may continue to impact demand for CDMA-based products in various regions. In addition, the weakness in financial markets has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income. While we do not forecast impairments, we have temporary unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized as other-than-temporary losses in future periods if market conditions do not improve. Given the market volatility and the significant judgments involved, accurately forecasting other-than-temporary impairments associated with our marketable securities is extremely difficult and actual results could vary materially. As a result, while we are providing revenue, operating income and our other standard guidance, we are not providing earnings per share guidance.
Moreover, our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
We are advised that the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) will issue a decision in our case shortly. This follows seven days of hearings which focused on claims contained in the Examiners' Report charging that certain of our business practices in South Korea were anticompetitive. The practices at issue relate to integration of certain functions on our chips as well as rebates and discounts offered to our customers. The KFTC may order modifications to some or all of those practices. However, until the order is issued, we are unable to assess any impact. We are also anticipating that the KFTC will impose a fine and, while we cannot estimate the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss, we expect it will be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. This by no means reflects our view of the merits of the case. We firmly believe that our practices do not violate South Korean competition law, are grounded in sound business practice and are consistent with our customers' desires. In the event of an adverse decision and the issuance of a formal order, which may take a number of months, we will seek a stay and pursue all avenues of appeal.
 
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic
 
investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented herein.
 
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of our technologies in wireless networks and of wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; the current uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on major customers and licensees; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic loans, investments and transactions we have or may pursue; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the FLO TV network and FLO technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports.

     (a) On September 21, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to Section 43 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") of the Company.

     The foregoing description of these amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of Section 43, as revised, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.

or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder has a right to vote any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation (for purposes of this bylaw a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner, and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household, and (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owners, if any, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings in connection with solicitations of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the corporation in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act of such stockholder's intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting and such proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. No business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
          (c) Subject to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of Directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). For nominations to be properly made at a meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, such notice must be received at the corporation's principal executive offices in accordance with the timeliness provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 5.

Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229).

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.

Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of Directors) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216).
Quorum

At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used.

If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.

Junior Officers, Employees and Other Agents
          (c) .
Good Faith
               (1) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or Designated Officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
 
                    (i) one or more officers or employees of the corporation as to the matters the Director or Designated Officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
                    (ii) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or Designated Officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and
                    (iii) a committee of the Board of Directors upon which such Director or Designated Officer does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee such Director or Designated Officer believes to merit confidence;
so long as, in each case, the Director or Designated Officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
               (2) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
               (3) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
          (d) . The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or Designated Officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
          (e) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and Designated Officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or Designated Officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or Designated Officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or
Enforcement
 
(ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
          (f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
          (g) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Rights
          (h) . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.
Insurance
          (i) . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
Amendments
          (j) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and Designated Officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any Director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such Director to receive such notice.
Failure to Receive Notice
          (h) . Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this paragraph. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 230).
Notice to Person with Undeliverable Address
     Section 45. . Except as otherwise set forth in paragraph (i) of Section 43 of these Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. The Board of Directors shall also have the power, if such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation, to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. (Del.

The loan, guarantee or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 143).
Loans to Officers
 
     Section 47. .
Annual Report
          (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the Board of Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder of the corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the corporation's fiscal year. Such report shall include a balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon of independent accountants or, if there is no such report, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation. When there are more than 100 stockholders of record of the corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California Corporations Code, additional information as required by Section 1501(b) of the California Corporations Code shall also be contained in such report, provided that if the corporation has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, that Act shall take precedence.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On November 4, 2009, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 27, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance
Table of Contents
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: John Gilbert Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  November 4, 2009  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended September 27, 2009.
"I am very pleased with the performance of our businesses this past year, despite a challenging and uncertain global economic environment," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Our revenues for fiscal year 2009 were in line with our guidance at the outset of the year.  Our operating performance remained strong, driven by continued 3G growth, execution in our chipset business and disciplined management of operating expenses. I am also pleased to announce that we recently extended our license agreement with Samsung covering both 3G and 4G."
"We continue to forecast growth for 3G CDMA in 2009, despite industry forecasts of a decline in the total handset market. We anticipate accelerated CDMA device growth in calendar year 2010 as the global migration to 3G continues. Our broad chipset portfolio continues to expand, including additional low-cost single-chip solutions to further enable the 3G migration as well as increased investments in software and application processors to strengthen our leadership position in supporting higher-end, feature-rich devices. We remain well positioned to drive innovation given our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow while maintaining our focus on overall operating expenses."
 
For comparison purposes, we note the following items:
GAAP Results
Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
    
Fourth Quarter
 
     
Fiscal 2009
Pro Forma Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items related to prior years and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
     
Fourth Quarter
 
     
Fiscal 2009
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $17.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared to $15.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and $11.3 billion a year ago. On October 2, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, payable on December 23, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2009.
The value of our marketable securities has improved significantly as financial markets have stabilized. At September 27, 2009, we had net unrealized gains on marketable securities of $674 million as compared to $25 million of net unrealized losses as of June 28, 2009.
 
Research and Development
 
N/M  Not Meaningful
Pro forma R&D expenses primarily related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. Pro forma R&D expenses decreased 2 percent year-over-year, primarily due to cost reduction efforts and a decrease in other employee-related expenses. QSI R&D expenses were related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 13 percent year-over-year, primarily due to cost reduction efforts and a decrease in other employee-related expenses. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to FLO TV.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2009 effective income tax rates were 23 percent for GAAP and 28 percent for pro forma.  The fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 GAAP results included a $155 million tax benefit as a result of tax audits to adjust our estimates of uncertain tax positions for prior years. This tax
 
benefit was excluded from our fiscal 2009 pro forma results to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including FLO TV.  GAAP results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 included a $0.05 diluted loss per share for the QSI segment. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 QSI results included $93 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
The volatility in financial markets may continue to have an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income (loss). While we do not forecast impairments, we have temporary unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized as other-than-temporary losses in future periods if market conditions do not improve.
Our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items. 
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 27, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance.

Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: Warren Kneeshaw Phone: 1-858-658-2983 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  January 27, 2010  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended December 27, 2009.
"We are pleased with our performance this quarter, driven by healthy demand for our chipsets, strong shipments of 3G devices by our licensees and lower operating expenses. We're executing on our strategic objectives and reaffirming our 2010 3G device forecast, an increase of 21 percent year-over-year," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "I am very encouraged by customer traction around Qualcomm technologies, including recent device announcements based on our industry-leading Snapdragon chipset and increased adoption of our Brew Mobile Platform operating system. As anticipated, we have seen a competitive pricing environment in the chipset market and are proactively managing within this dynamic to grow our market share. A subdued economic recovery in developed regions, including Europe and Japan, combined with relative strength at the lower end of the market, is changing our estimated 3G device average selling price and chipset mix for this fiscal year. Accordingly, we are modestly reducing our fiscal year revenue estimates to reflect this near-term market situation, but are maintaining our earnings per share guidance."
"The fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. We are confident that 3G will continue to develop as anticipated, and we continue to invest in innovative new products, such as Snapdragon, FLO TV, mirasol and next-generation technologies, to enhance our leadership position and capitalize on this growth."
 
First Quarter Results (GAAP)
Pro Forma First Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
The large increase in net income year-over-year was primarily due to a significant improvement in net investment income as our marketable securities recovered value and financial markets stabilized. The significant decrease in cash flows year-over-year was primarily due to the receipt of a $2.5 billion payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the license and settlement agreements with Nokia.
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.

Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $18.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010, compared to $17.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and $13.1 billion a year ago. On January 7, 2010, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share payable on March 26, 2010 to stockholders of record as of February 26, 2010.
Research and Development
 
Pro forma R&D expenses primarily related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 11 percent year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in costs related to litigation and other legal matters. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to FLO TV.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2010 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 21 percent for GAAP and approximately 21 to 22 percent for pro forma. Our estimate of the fiscal 2010 GAAP effective tax rate includes tax expense of approximately $130 million that arises because deferred revenue related to the 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia is taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower as a result of California tax legislation enacted in 2009. This tax expense was excluded from our pro forma results to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including FLO TV. GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 included a $0.03 diluted loss per share for the QSI segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2010 QSI results included $106 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
 
The potential instability in financial markets may continue to have an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income (loss). While we do not forecast impairments, we have temporary unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized as other-than-temporary losses in future periods if financial conditions affecting those securities do not improve.
Our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors
 
outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial
 
strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of our technologies in wireless networks and of wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; the current uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on major customers and licensees; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the FLO TV network and FLO technology; the development and commercial acceptance of the IMOD display technology; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: Warren Kneeshaw Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  April 21, 2010  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 ended March 28, 2010.
"We delivered strong financial results this quarter, driven by healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets. 3G subscribers have now surpassed 1 billion worldwide and with the 3G auction process underway in India, the 3G footprint continues to expand globally," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Calendar year 2010 3G device shipments are progressing in line with our expectations, and although we're continuing to operate in a competitive chipset pricing environment, we're positioned to continue to grow share through new partner engagements and our broad, industry-leading 3G chipset roadmap. Our business is executing well and we are pleased to be raising our earnings guidance for the fiscal year."
Second Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
Pro Forma Second Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release. Prior period reconciliations are presented on Qualcomm's Investor Relations web page at www.qualcomm.com.
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $18.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010, compared to $18.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $14.0 billion a year ago. On April 8, 2010, we announced a cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on June 25, 2010 to stockholders of record as of May 28, 2010.
Research and Development
 
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 8 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were primarily related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 6 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in patent-related costs. QSI SG&A expenses increased 133 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses related to FLO TV.
 
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2010 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 21 percent for GAAP and approximately 21 to 22 percent for pro forma. Our estimate of the fiscal 2010 GAAP effective tax rate includes tax expense of approximately $130 million that arises because deferred revenue related to the 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia is taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower as a result of California tax legislation enacted in 2009. This tax expense was excluded from our pro forma results to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including FLO TV. GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 included a $0.05 diluted loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2010 QSI results included $134 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV.
Business Outlook and Description of Changes to QTL Metrics
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
As a result of our analysis of information recently received from licensee audits and public disclosures concerning licensee market share, unit shipments and average selling prices (ASPs) as well as our evaluation of the evolving CDMA-based device industry (particularly the growth of the modem card/module device segment), we have adjusted some of the underlying assumptions used to estimate licensee unit shipments and ASPs, which we believe will improve our estimates. Also, beginning with this earnings release, we will provide investors with the total subscriber device sales reported to us by subscriber licensees during the relevant period, without adjustment for the differences in how licensees report sales information (e.g., some licensees report selling prices net of permitted deductions, such as transportation, insurance and packing costs, while other licensees do not). We believe the changes referenced
 
above will continue to help investors understand important trends in our licensing business. We plan to discuss these changes in greater detail on our earnings call beginning at 1:45pm Pacific Time today.
For comparative purposes only, we are providing a table herein entitled "Changes to QTL Metrics" to show for fiscal 2009 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2010: 1) total reported subscriber device sales; 2) our prior ASP estimates and subscriber device shipment estimates; and 3) ASP estimates and subscriber device shipment estimates applying our adjusted estimation assumptions.
Our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. While we do not forecast impairments, we have temporary unrealized losses on marketable securities that could be recognized as other-than-temporary losses in future periods if financial conditions affecting those securities do not improve. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.
 
The following estimates are approximations and are based on the current business outlook:

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each
 
fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our technologies in wireless networks and of wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of
 
these proceedings; our dependence on major customers and licensees; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; our ability to maintain and improve operational efficiencies and profitability; the development, deployment and commercial acceptance of the FLO TV network and FLO technology; the development and commercial acceptance of the mirasol display technology; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2009 and most recent Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 21, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: Warren Kneeshaw Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  July 21, 2010  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ended June 27, 2010.
"Our financial performance this quarter exceeded our prior expectations, driven by record MSM chipset shipments, favorable product mix and continued strong demand for 3G devices around the world," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Looking forward, we continue to see healthy CDMA-based device growth of approximately 23 percent in calendar year 2010, and are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year."
Third Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
Pro Forma Third Quarter Results
Pro forma results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pro forma results are included at the end of this news release.
Third Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $17.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, compared to $18.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and $15.7 billion a year ago. On July 8, 2010, we announced a cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on September 24, 2010 to stockholders of record as of August 27, 2010.
Research and Development
N/M  Not Meaningful
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 4 percent year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were primarily related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
Selling, General and Administrative
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13 percent year-over-year primarily due to an increase in patent-related costs. Third quarter fiscal 2010 QSI SG&A expenses included a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. Other QSI SG&A expenses increased by $12 million primarily due to selling and marketing expenses related to FLO TV.
 
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2010 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 20 percent for GAAP and approximately 20 to 21 percent for pro forma. Our estimate of the fiscal 2010 GAAP effective tax rate includes tax expense of approximately $130 million that arises because deferred revenue related to the 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia is taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower as a result of California tax legislation enacted in 2009. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded $20 million of tax expense as a result of prior year tax audits completed during the third fiscal quarter. The tax expense related to these items was excluded from our pro forma results to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment is composed of our strategic investments, including FLO TV and the Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum recently won in the auction in India. GAAP results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 included a net loss of $4 million for the QSI segment. The third quarter of fiscal 2010 QSI results included $118 million in operating expenses, primarily related to FLO TV, partially offset by a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. In June 2010, in connection with the India BWA spectrum purchase, we entered into a bank loan agreement that is payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2010. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the carrying value of the loan was $1.06 billion.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. In addition, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
 
or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we exclude forecasts of such items from our business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if we incur any such income or expense items.
The following table summarizes GAAP and pro forma guidance based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of pro forma results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Pro forma information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock
 
market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "pro forma" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our technologies in wireless networks and of wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA both domestically and internationally; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; attacks on our business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-

Item 5.02(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On September 10, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") adopted and approved an amendment and restatement (the "Amendment") of the Company's Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (the "ERMCP"). Under the ERMCP, eligible employees and members of the Company's Board of Directors can elect to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Deferred amounts are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company, and the Company provides matching credits equal to 50% of the eligible employee's deferrals up to the remainder of (1) 10% of the eligible employee's total compensation for the applicable plan year, reduced by (2) 50% of the maximum 401(k) plan contribution limit established under section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for the plan year, determined without regard to "catch-up contributions" pursuant to Code section 414(v). The matching amounts are credited and paid in Company common stock. Deferrals and matching amounts are paid upon termination of service with the Company. Both under the previous ERMCP and the Amendment, members of the Company's Board of Directors do not receive matching credits for their deferrals.
     Before the Amendment, matching amounts were credited to the accounts of eligible employees on a quarterly basis based on deferrals made during the quarter and the average closing price of Company common stock during the ten-trading-day period preceding the last day of the quarter. Matching amounts credited for any year vested (1) in full upon an eligible employee's death, disability, attainment of age 65 while employed with the Company, or involuntary termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the ERMCP) or voluntary termination of employment for Good Reason (as defined in the ERMCP) (in both cases within 24 months after a change in control of the Company); (2) in five annual installments beginning when an eligible employee attains age 61 and completes three years of service, so long as the eligible employee is employed by the Company on each vesting date; or (3) in four annual installments beginning on the first day of the second plan year after the year in which the matching amounts were credited to the eligible employee's account, so long as the eligible employee is employed by the Company on each vesting date and deferred amounts into the ERMCP during the year immediately preceding the year in which the vesting date occurs.
     Under the Amendment, effective January 1, 2011, an eligible employee will receive matching amounts for a calendar year only if he or she is actively employed on the first day of the next calendar year or is terminated without Cause during the calendar year. The matching amounts continue to be credited and paid in shares of Company common stock, but the number of shares to be credited will be determined based on the average closing price of Company common stock during a 200-trading-day period preceding the date on which the matching contributions are credited. Under the Amendment, effective September 27, 2010, all matching amounts vest in full upon an eligible employee's death, disability, attainment of age 65 while employed with the Company, involuntary termination of employment without Cause or voluntary termination of employment for Good Reason (in both cases within 24 months after a change in control of the Company), or completion of two continuous years of service with the Company commencing with the employee's date of hire. The Amendment also specifies that cash dividends on Company common stock will be credited to an eligible employee's account in the form of additional shares, which are subject to the same terms and vesting and payment dates as the matching amounts to which they relate, with fractional shares to be paid in cash within 30 days after the payment date of the Company contributions.
     The preceding summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

In the event that the Trust for any reason holds cash or other property in an amount insufficient to purchase a whole share of the Company's Common Stock, such amount shall be held in cash or a cash equivalent determined by the Committee.

provided that any fractional shares attributable to cash dividends paid on the Matching Contributions and/or Discretionary Company Contributions shall be paid in cash within thirty (30) days following the date of payment of the Matching Contributions and/or Discretionary Company Contributions based on the Fair Market Value on the date of payment of the Matching Contributions and/or Discretionary Company Contributions.

Participant, then the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the Participant's surviving spouse. In the event there is no surviving spouse, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.

Tax Withholding

The determination by a Participant of any reduction shall be conclusive and binding upon the Employer, the Company, and the Committee. The Committee shall reduce a Distribution and/or shall accept the return of some or all of a Distribution previously made to a Participant only upon written notice by the Participant indicating the amount of such reduction.

Successor to Company
 
     12.1 . In the event that a Participant becomes employed by any affiliated company, subsidiary corporation, parent corporation or unrelated corporation with which the Company enters into a transaction to acquire the assets or stock of such unrelated corporation, the Committee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Trustee to transfer funds in an amount equal to the amount credited to such Participant's Account (the "Transferred Account") to a trust established under a Transferee Plan. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether such transfer shall be made and the timing of such transfer. Such transfer shall be made if, and only to the extent that, approval of such transfer is obtained from the Trustee.
Transfers to Other Plans
          12.1.1 . For purposes of this Section 12.1, "Transferee Plan" shall mean an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(l) of ERISA maintained by any of the Company's affiliated entities, subsidiary corporations, parent corporations or any corporation unrelated to the Company with which the Company has successfully closed a transaction in which the Company acquired the assets or the outstanding stock of such unrelated corporation.
Transferee Plan

Subsequent earnings on the amount in the Transfer Account shall be credited to a separate Account for the Eligible Employee established pursuant to this Plan and shall be determined under the Plan's investment procedures in Article 6.
Transfers in from Other Plans
     12.3 . This Section 12 shall only be operable to the extent the Committee determines and in its sole and absolute discretion at the time of any proposed transfer that such transfer will not impact the Plan and any deferred amounts in a tax disadvantageous manner under Section 409A of the Code.
Effect of Section
     13.1 . The right of any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person to the payment of any benefits under this Plan shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered, including pursuant to domestic relations orders.
No Assignment
 
     13.2 . The obligations of the Company to Participants under this Plan shall not be funded or otherwise secured, and shall be paid out of the general assets of the Company. Participants are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to the Company's contributions hereunder and shall have no legal or equitable interest in the assets of the Company, including any assets the Company may set aside or reserve against its obligations under this Plan.
No Secured Interest
     13.3 . This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Employer, its successors and assigns and the Participant and his or her heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On November 3, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 26, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP." Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
     The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: Warren Kneeshaw Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  November 3, 2010  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended September 26, 2010.
"I am very pleased with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Our outlook includes strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, including smartphones and other data-centric devices, driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. With our industry-leading chipset roadmap, broad licensing program and increasing number of global partners, we are well positioned to take advantage of these industry trends."
GAAP Results
Qualcomm results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with GAAP and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
In the year-over-year comparisons summarized above, the following should be noted: fiscal 2009 results (GAAP and Non-GAAP) included a $783 million charge related to a litigation settlement and patent agreement with Broadcom Corporation, including $35 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009; both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 results (GAAP and Non-GAAP) also included a $230 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission fine; GAAP results in fiscal 2009 included a $155 million tax benefit related to prior years as a result of tax audits; net income was favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 (GAAP and Non-GAAP) due to a significant increase in net investment income; and fiscal 2009 operating and free cash flow included the receipt of a $2.5 billion payment related to the license and settlement agreements with Nokia.
Key Business Metrics
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $18.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, compared to $17.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and $17.7 billion a year ago. On October 13, 2010, we announced a cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on December 22, 2010 to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010.
Research and Development
 
Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 6 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were primarily related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 21 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in legal and patent-related costs. QSI SG&A expenses were primarily related to FLO TV.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2010 effective income tax rates were 20 percent for both GAAP and Non-GAAP. The fiscal 2010 GAAP effective tax rate included tax expense of $137 million because deferred revenue related to the 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia was taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate, based on the legislation in effect during fiscal 2010, will be lower. The fiscal 2010 GAAP effective tax rate also included $20 million of tax expense as a result of prior year tax audits completed during the fiscal year. The tax expense related to these items was excluded from our Non-GAAP results to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment manages our strategic investment activities, including FLO TV, and makes strategic investments in early-stage companies and in wireless spectrum, such as the Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum recently won in the auction in India. GAAP results for the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 included a $0.05 loss per share for the QSI segment.
The fourth quarter fiscal 2010 QSI results included $132 million in operating expenses primarily related to FLO TV. In June 2010, in connection with the India BWA spectrum purchase, we entered into a bank loan agreement that is payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2010. At the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2010, the carrying value of the loan was $1.09 billion.
 
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, or gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
We have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV service business. In addition to our ongoing operating costs, we expect to incur restructuring charges related to this plan in the range of $125 million to $175 million in fiscal 2011, which are primarily related to certain contractual obligations and are included in our fiscal 2011 outlook included herein. Additionally, we continue to evaluate strategic options for the FLO TV business, which include, but are not limited to, operating the FLO TV network under a new wholesale service; sale to, or joint venture with, a third party; and/or the sale of the spectrum licenses and the discontinuance of the operation of the network. Additional charges, including impairment of assets, may be incurred as we continue to evaluate or implement these strategic options or if we are unable to generate adequate future cash flows associated with this business.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts
 
in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our technologies in wireless networks and of wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA, both domestically and internationally; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies,
 
and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; defects or errors in our products and services; the success of the FLO TV service business and MediaFLO technology; the development and commercial success of the mirasol display technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2010.

     (d) On December 6, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") appointed Dr. Francisco Ros to its Board of Directors. Dr. Ros was appointed for a term of office that expires at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Other than as set forth herein, there was not and is not any arrangement or understanding between Dr. Ros and any other person pursuant to which Dr. Ros was selected to be a director. Dr. Ros will receive compensation for his services as a non-employee director under our director compensation program. The components of that program were described in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 2, 2010. Subsequent to that Proxy Statement, the director compensation program was revised to increase the annual cash retainer for directors who are non-U.S. residents to $120,000 in consideration of their increased travel time. The Board has not yet determined whether to name Dr. Ros to any of its committees.

SAN DIEGO AND SAN JOSE  January 5, 2011  Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Atheros Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHR), today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Qualcomm intends to acquire Atheros, a leader in innovative technologies for wireless and wired local area connectivity in the computing, networking and consumer electronics industries. The acquisition is intended to help accelerate the expansion of Qualcomm's technologies and platforms to new businesses beyond cellular and provide access to significant new growth opportunities.
 
Qualcomm has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Atheros for $45 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. The transaction has been approved by the Qualcomm and Atheros boards of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of Atheros' stockholders. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2011. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, Qualcomm expects the acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2012, the first full year of combined operations. Qualcomm intends to finalize its estimates of the transaction's financial impact, as well as the accounting for the transaction, upon deal close.
"It is Qualcomm's strategy to continually integrate additional technologies into mobile devices to make them the primary way that people communicate, compute and access content. This acquisition is a natural extension of that strategy into other types of devices," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "The combination of Qualcomm and Atheros is intended to accelerate this opportunity by utilizing best-in-class products for communications, computing and consumer electronics to broaden existing customer relationships and expand access to new partners and distribution channels."
Atheros' current president and CEO, Dr. Craig H. Barratt, is expected to join Qualcomm as president of Qualcomm Networking & Connectivity.
 
"Qualcomm and Atheros have a long history of collaboration and share a culture of technical innovation and execution excellence," Barratt said. "The Atheros team will build upon Qualcomm's strengths and leadership to bolster our customers' ability to deliver innovative and differentiated products in the increasingly connected world."
"With this acquisition and our complementary products, Qualcomm will be in a strong position to take our successful mobile strategy of bringing the best technologies together into a systems solution and apply this to new opportunities," said Steve Mollenkopf, EVP and group president of Qualcomm. "We see this strategy as central to helping our customers capitalize on the ubiquitous connectivity and seamless experiences that are developing across mobile phones, computing and consumer electronics."

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 26, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP." Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
Table of Contents
     The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Qualcomm Contact: Warren Kneeshaw Phone: 1-858-658-4813 e-mail:
ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  January 26, 2011  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced record results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 ended December 26, 2010.
"We are very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments this quarter driven by increased demand for smartphones and data-centric devices across an expanding number of regions and price points," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "In addition, we have resolved one of our previously disclosed licensee disputes, which will be reflected beginning with the second fiscal quarter results. We continue to execute on our strategic objectives as our partners leverage our technologies and solutions to offer leading wireless products and services to consumers around the globe. We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these industry trends and are substantially raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year."
First Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
Non-GAAP First Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
First Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $19.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $18.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and $18.9 billion a year ago. On January 5, 2011, we announced an agreement to acquire Atheros Communications, Inc. for $45 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of $3.1 billion on that date. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2011, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of Atheros' stockholders. On January 14, 2011, we announced a cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on March 25, 2011 to stockholders of record as of February 25, 2011.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 11 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. QSI R&D expenses were primarily related to our FLO TV subsidiary.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 26 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs and patent-related costs and other professional fees. QSI SG&A expenses decreased 44 percent y-o-y primarily due to a decrease in selling and marketing costs related to FLO TV.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2011 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 17 percent for GAAP and approximately 21 percent for Non-GAAP. The first quarter GAAP effective tax rate of 12 percent was lower than the estimated annual effective tax rate primarily due to a $32 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010 as a result of the retroactive reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. This tax benefit was excluded from our Non-GAAP results.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment manages our strategic investment activities, including FLO TV, and makes strategic investments in early-stage and other companies and in wireless spectrum, such as the Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum won in the auction in India. GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 included a $0.05 loss per share for the QSI segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2011 QSI results included $134 million in operating expenses primarily related to FLO TV.
On December 20, 2010, we announced that we agreed to sell substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.925 billion to AT&T, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement follows our previously announced plan to restructure and evaluate strategic options related to our FLO TV business and network.
Under the restructuring plan, we now expect that the FLO TV business and network will be shut down in March 2011 and are in the process of shutting down the MediaFLO Technologies division. Restructuring activities under this plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2012. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to this plan
 
included in QSI results were $64 million. We estimate that we will incur future restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with this plan in the range of $300 million to $375 million, of which substantially all are expected to be recorded in fiscal 2011 in the QSI segment.
In December 2010, the loan that was obtained in connection with the India BWA spectrum purchase was refinanced. The new loans are payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2012. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the aggregate carrying value of the loans was $1.09 billion.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, or gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
Our second quarter and fiscal 2011 outlook reflects the impact related to the resolution of one of our previously disclosed licensee disputes. Favorable resolution of the Panasonic dispute will be further upside if completed this fiscal year.
In addition to our ongoing operating costs, our business outlook for the second fiscal quarter and fiscal 2011 include restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to FLO TV and the MediaFLO technology division that are currently expected to be incurred.
We have not included any estimates related to the Atheros business in our fiscal 2011 outlook. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2011. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, we expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2012, the first full year of combined operations.
 
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing
 
core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive
 
extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our technologies in wireless networks and wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection
 
therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; defects or errors in our products and services; the development and commercial success of the mirasol display technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2010 and most recent Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 20, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP." Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
     Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
     The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

SAN DIEGO  April 20, 2011  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 ended March 27, 2011.
"We are pleased to report record quarterly revenues, and we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the year as the demand for smartphones across an array of geographies and tiers continues to grow," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "In addition, we have resolved the second of the two previously disclosed licensee disputes. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities as our partners deploy our technologies and solutions to offer leading wireless products and services to consumers worldwide."
Second Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
Non-GAAP Second Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items that are not related to the current year and acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense.
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
In the comparisons summarized above, the following should be noted with respect to results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011: GAAP and Non-GAAP results included $401 million in revenues related to prior quarters as a result of agreements entered into with two licensees to settle ongoing disputes, including an arbitration proceeding with Panasonic Mobile Communications Co. Ltd.; GAAP results included $310 million in expenses in the QSI segment related to the FLO TV restructuring plan; and GAAP and Non-GAAP results included $120 million in impairment charges related to our Firethorn division, including $114 million in goodwill impairment.

Second Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $22.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $19.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and $18.2 billion a year ago. On April 7, 2011, we announced a cash dividend of $0.215 per share payable on June 24, 2011 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2011.
On January 5, 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Atheros Communications, Inc. for $45 per share in cash, which represented an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion on that date. The transaction has received the approval of Atheros' stockholders and certain foreign regulators, and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has expired. The completion of the merger remains subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of an additional foreign regulatory approval. We continue to expect the merger to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
Research and Development
 
N/M  Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 16 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next-generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and
 
services. QSI R&D expenses decreased 87 percent y-o-y primarily due to the shut down of our FLO TV business and network.
Selling, General and Administrative
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 42 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in charitable donations, employee-related costs and professional fees. QSI SG&A expenses increased 18 percent y-o-y primarily due to increased costs related to the shut down of our FLO TV business and network.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2011 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 17 percent for GAAP and approximately 21 percent for Non-GAAP. The second quarter rates of 21 percent for GAAP and 22 percent for Non-GAAP are higher than the estimated annual rates primarily due to additional U.S. income resulting from the settlement of ongoing disputes with two licensees during the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment manages our strategic investment activities, including FLO TV, and makes strategic investments in early-stage and other companies and in wireless spectrum, such as the Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum won in the India auction. GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 included an $0.18 loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2011 QSI results included $376 million in operating expenses and restructuring charges primarily related to FLO TV.
We have agreed to sell substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The agreement follows our previously announced plan to
 
restructure and evaluate strategic options related to the FLO TV business and network. Under the restructuring plan, the FLO TV business and network were shut down on March 27, 2011, and we are no longer pursuing the MediaFLO Technologies business. Restructuring activities under this plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2012. The spectrum was classified as held for sale at March 27, 2011.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to this plan included in QSI results were $310 million. We estimate that we will incur future restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with this plan of up to $65 million, which are primarily related to lease exit and other costs.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or the consequences of injunctions, damages or fines related to any pending legal matters unless awarded or imposed by a court, governmental entity or other regulatory body. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, or gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
In addition to our ongoing operating costs, our business outlook for fiscal 2011 includes restructuring and restructuring-related charges attributable to FLO TV that are currently expected to be incurred.
We have not included any estimates related to the Atheros business in our third fiscal quarter or fiscal 2011 outlook. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

For more than 25 years, Qualcomm ideas and inventions have driven the evolution of wireless communications, connecting people more closely to information, entertainment and each other.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year
 
presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the following tables.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our
 
technologies in wireless networks and wireless communications, equipment and services, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and OFDMA; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; defects or errors in our products and services; the development and commercial success of our QMT division's mirasol display technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2010 and most recent Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On May 24, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Qualcomm"), completed its previously announced acquisition of Atheros Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Atheros"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 5, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Qualcomm, T Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm ("Merger Sub"), and Atheros, Merger Sub merged with and into Atheros with Atheros surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm.
     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Atheros common stock (other than shares owned by Atheros, Qualcomm or Merger Sub) was converted into the right to receive $45.00 in cash, without interest.
     In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, all outstanding and unexercised Atheros stock options, whether or not vested, were converted into options to purchase shares of Qualcomm common stock, other than those stock options held by Atheros' non-employee directors, which were converted into the right to receive cash based on a formula contained in the Merger Agreement, and all outstanding Atheros restricted stock units were converted into restricted stock units for Qualcomm common stock, with any performance-based vesting conditions converted to service-based vesting conditions.
     A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.
Item 8.01. Other Events.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN DIEGO  May 24, 2011  Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Atheros Communications, Inc. The Atheros team will operate as Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm. In addition, the Qualcomm connectivity team will shift over to Qualcomm Atheros to combine resources and roadmaps. This creates one of the industry's most robust portfolios of connectivity, networking and location solutions for mobile, computing, enterprise and consumer electronic devices. Together, the two companies will be able to utilize their technology leadership positions, relationships and assets to more effectively address promising new business opportunities.
 
The acquisition, which was completed at an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion, enables Qualcomm to expand its presence in existing businesses and grow into a variety of adjacent businesses including home, enterprise and carrier networking. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest in, support and grow Qualcomm Atheros' robust portfolio of businesses and technologies.
While the accounting for the transaction is not yet finalized, Qualcomm estimates that on a Non-GAAP basis the acquisition will be modestly dilutive to earnings per share in fiscal 2011 and modestly accretive in fiscal 2012, consistent with our previous forecasts. In addition, based on preliminary estimates, we expect the transaction to be further dilutive to GAAP earnings by approximately $0.09 to $0.13 per share for the remainder of fiscal 2011 driven primarily by certain near-term purchase accounting charges and secondarily by ongoing share-based compensation expense. These near-term purchase accounting charges result from the requirement in ASC 805 to record acquired inventory and backlog at fair value at the time of acquisition, which will result in reduced margin contribution as inventory and backlog as of the acquisition date are converted to revenues over the remainder of fiscal 2011.
"Today marks another milestone in Qualcomm's mission to provide our customers with the best-in-class connectivity and networking solutions needed to capitalize on expanding business opportunities beyond handsets and tablets," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "We believe that the complementary cultures, product portfolios, sales channels and leadership in our respective fields will help make Qualcomm a leading force in the networking, computing and consumer electronics industries for years to come."
 
Dr. Craig Barratt, formerly CEO and president of Atheros, is now president of Qualcomm Atheros and reports directly to Steve Mollenkopf, executive vice president and group president of Qualcomm.

Explanatory Note
This current report on Form 8-K/A updates information provided on a Form 8-K dated March 8, 2011 relating to disclosures made under Item 5.07, Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders, associated with QUALCOMM Incorporated's (the "Company") Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") held on March 8, 2011.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported, at the Annual Meeting, a non-binding, advisory vote was taken on the frequency of future advisory votes regarding the compensation of the Company's executive officers. A majority of the shares voted for holding such advisory votes on an annual basis.
After consideration of these voting results and other factors, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors decided that the Company will hold future advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis. These annual advisory votes on executive compensation will continue until the Compensation Committee considers the results of the next stockholder advisory vote regarding the frequency with which future advisory votes on executive compensation should be held.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
As previously reported, at the Annual Meeting, a majority of the shares voting were voted in favor of a stockholder proposal requesting that the Board of Directors initiate amendment of the Company's corporate governance documents to establish a majority voting process for director elections. In that majority voting process, director nominees would be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at an annual meeting of stockholders, with a plurality vote standard retained for contested director elections. The Board of Directors has therefore determined that the agenda for the next annual meeting of stockholders will include a proposed amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, removing current provisions that establish a plurality voting standard for election of directors. If stockholders approve that amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors would then establish a majority voting process in the Company's Bylaws.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On July 20, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 26, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP." The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.
Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2011, the Company began excluding the benefit of retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period
comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. We believe this practice also conforms to the approach taken by many other leading technology companies.
The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we changed our methodology for reporting Non-GAAP results to exclude the recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets, in addition to our historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development (R&D) expense. Third quarter of fiscal 2011 Non-GAAP results excluded $45 million related to the step-up of inventories to fair value and $32 million in amortization of intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition of Atheros Communications, Inc. (Atheros).
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
In the comparisons summarized above for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the following should be noted: results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 included $401 million in revenues related to prior quarters as a result of agreements entered into with two licensees to settle
 
 
disputes and $120 million in impairment charges related to our Firethorn division, including $114 million in goodwill impairment.
Third Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $20.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $22.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and $17.6 billion a year ago. Upon the close of the Atheros acquisition on May 24, 2011, we paid $3.1 billion in cash, net of the cash acquired. On July 13, 2011, we announced a cash dividend of $0.215 per share payable on September 23, 2011 to stockholders of record as of August 26, 2011.
Research and Development
 
 As adjusted for discontinued operations
*
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 21 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services.
 
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
 As adjusted for discontinued operations
*
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. QSI SG&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 included a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2011 effective income tax rates are estimated to be 20 percent for GAAP and 21 percent for Non-GAAP. Our fiscal 2011 estimated GAAP tax rate increased from our prior estimate of 17 percent primarily as a result of the reclassification of tax benefits to discontinued operations and lower foreign earnings related to the step-up of acquired Atheros assets to fair value. The third quarter GAAP tax rate of 23 percent was a result of this increase in the estimated annual effective tax rate.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we reached agreement with the California Franchise Tax Board on a component of our fiscal 2006 through 2010 tax returns. As a result of this agreement, we expect to record a $44 million tax benefit that will be excluded from our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 Non-GAAP results. This estimated benefit, which is included in our guidance, will reduce our fiscal 2011 estimated GAAP tax rate from 20 percent to 19 percent.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment makes strategic investments in early-stage and other companies and in wireless spectrum, such as the Broadband Wireless Access spectrum won in the India auction. QSI also includes the discontinued operations of our FLO TV subsidiary. GAAP results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 included $0.01 earnings per share for the QSI segment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, in connection with the presentation of the FLO TV business as discontinued operations and the requirement to compute the tax effect of discontinued
 
 
operations on a discrete basis, we recorded a tax benefit of $43 million for tax benefits related to losses incurred in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2011 that were previously included in the calculation of the estimated annual effective tax rate.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses, or gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other
 
 
companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in
 
 
order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2011, the Company began excluding the benefit of retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. We believe this practice also conforms to the approach taken by many other leading technology companies.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the rate of deployment and adoption of, and demand for, our technologies in communications, products and services; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and its potential impact on demand for our products, services or applications and the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on major customers and
 
 
licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue; defects or errors in our products and services; the development and commercial success of our QMT division's mirasol display technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2010 and the most recent Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On November 2, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 25, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP."

program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2011, the Company began excluding the benefit of retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ
 
substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks associated with: the commercial deployment of, and demand for, our technologies in communications products and services; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and their potential impacts on demand for our products, services or applications and on the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on major customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party suppliers; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue, including our investment in the BWA Spectrum in India which is currently subject to legal proceedings; failures, defects or errors in our products and services or in the products of our customers; the commercial success of our QMT division's IMOD display technology; as well as the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2011.

On February 1, 2012, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("Qualcomm" or the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended December 25, 2011. A copy of that press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as "Non-GAAP." The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.
Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but that were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses.
The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength.

SAN DIEGO  February 1, 2012  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced record results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended December 25, 2011.
"I am pleased to report another record quarter with revenues, earnings and MSM shipments reaching all-time highs, driven by our industry-leading chipset portfolio and the continued strong demand for smartphones around the world," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "We are raising our revenue and earnings guidance as our broad licensing partnerships and extensive chipset roadmap, led by our integrated Snapdragon processors, position us well for strong growth in fiscal 2012. We continue to invest in innovative wireless technologies, products and services, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead as 3G and 4G continue to expand across new device types and geographies."
First Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP First Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
The following should be noted with regards to the above results and year-over-year comparisons: first quarter fiscal 2012 results included the results of Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., which was acquired on May 24, 2011. Additionally, on December 27, 2011, after the close of our first fiscal quarter, we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion. As a result, we will recognize a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the close of this transaction.
 
 
First Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $22.0 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $20.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and $19.1 billion a year ago. As of December 25, 2011, $948 million remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. On January 10, 2012, we announced a cash dividend of $0.215 per share payable on March 23, 2012 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2012.
Research and Development
 
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 33 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in investments in the development of integrated circuit products (including connectivity products), next-generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services.
 
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 11 percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in employee-related and marketing costs.
Effective Income Tax Rates
Our fiscal 2012 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 18 percent for GAAP and approximately 18 to 19 percent for Non-GAAP. The first quarter effective income tax rates for GAAP and Non-GAAP were both 19 percent.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. QSI also includes the discontinued operations of our FLO TV business. GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 included a $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
 
 
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
 
 
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but that were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the
 
 
potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding the Company's business outlook; growth expectations; and estimates and guidance related to financial performance, effective income tax rates, MSM shipments, device shipments, device sales and device average selling prices. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "guidance" and similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to, risks associated with the commercial deployment of, and demand for, our technologies in communications products
 
 
and services; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and their potential impacts on demand for our products, services or applications and on the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on a small number of customers and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party suppliers; the commercial success of our QMT division's IMOD display technology; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue, including our investment in the BWA Spectrum in India, which is currently subject to legal proceedings; and failures and defects or errors in our products and services or in the products of our customers. These and other risks are set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2011 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 25, 2011 filed with the SEC. Our reports filed with the SEC are available on our website at .

Second Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Second Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release.
Note: The following should be considered with regard to the above results and comparisons - the second quarter of fiscal 2012 GAAP results included $761 million, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations (as a result of a $1.2 billion gain associated with the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum), as compared to a $269 million loss, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Additionally, the second quarter of fiscal 2012 GAAP and Non-GAAP results included the results of Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The second quarter of fiscal 2011 GAAP and Non-GAAP results included $401 million in revenues relating to prior quarters as a result of agreements entered into with two licensees to settle disputes.
Second Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $22.1 billion a year ago and $22.0 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we received $1.9 billion in proceeds from the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum. On April 3, 2012, we announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on June 20, 2012 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2012.
Research and Development
 
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased 30 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in investments in the development of integrated circuit products (including connectivity products), next-generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13 percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in costs relating to legal matters, employee-related expenses, patent-related expenses and selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by a decrease in charitable donations. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we made a contribution to the Qualcomm Charitable Foundation in connection with the establishment of that entity.
Effective Income Tax Rates
Our fiscal 2012 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 18 percent for GAAP and approximately 18 to 19 percent for Non-GAAP. The second quarter effective income tax rates for GAAP and Non-GAAP were both 17 percent, which are lower than the estimated annual effective tax rates, primarily due to changes in our estimates related to certain permanent differences and foreign earnings taxed at rates that are less than the United States federal tax rate.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. QSI also includes the discontinued operations of our FLO TV business. GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 included $0.41 earnings per share for the QSI segment. QSI results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 included a $1.2 billion gain in discontinued operations, or $0.44 earnings per share, associated with the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum, and $81 million in other operating expenses related to a payment made to the Indian government in connection with the issuance of the BWA spectrum license.
 
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing
 
core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing operational performance as they are deemed to be unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, which may include the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected award life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are deemed to
 
be unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. Certain tax items that were recorded in each fiscal year presented, but that were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended.
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding anticipated growth for 3G and 4G smartphones and new mobile computing devices, increasing operating expenses, the Company's business outlook, and estimates and guidance related to financial performance, effective income tax rates, MSM chip shipments, device shipments, device sales and device average selling prices. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "guidance" and similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to, risks associated with the commercial deployment of, and demand for, our technologies in communications products and services; the uncertainty of global economic conditions and their potential impacts on demand for our products, services or applications and on the value of our marketable securities; competition; our dependence on a small number of customers
 
and licensees; attacks on our licensing business model, including results of current and future litigation and arbitration proceedings, as well as actions of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies, and the costs we incur in connection therewith, including potentially damaged relationships with customers and operators who may be impacted by the results of these proceedings; our dependence on third-party suppliers, including the potential impact of supply constraints; the commercial success of our QMT division's IMOD display technology; foreign currency fluctuations; strategic investments and transactions we have or may pursue, including our investment in the BWA spectrum in India; and failures and defects or errors in our products and services or in the products of our customers. These and other risks are set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2011 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 25, 2012 filed with the SEC. Our reports filed with the SEC are available on our website at . We undertake no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(d) On July 8, 2012, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") appointed Dr. Susan Hockfield to its Board of Directors. Dr. Hockfield was appointed for a term of office that expires at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders. There was not and is not any arrangement or understanding between Dr. Hockfield and any other person pursuant to which Dr. Hockfield was selected to be a director. Dr. Hockfield will receive compensation for her services as a non-employee director under the Company's director compensation program. Under that program, Dr. Hockfield was granted 2,109 deferred stock units ("DSUs") on July 8, 2012, representing a pro rata portion of the value of a DSU award for a full year of service on the Company's Board of Directors. The other components of the director compensation program were described in the Company's Proxy Statement (the "Proxy Statement") for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 6, 2012 (the "2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders"). The Board of Directors has not yet determined whether to name Dr. Hockfield to any of its committees.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
(a) At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation that eliminated the plurality voting provision for the election of directors. Following that approval, the Company filed a corresponding Certificate of Amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. In the Proxy Statement, the Company indicated that if its stockholders approved the amendment, its Board of Directors would then also consider amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to implement a majority voting process for uncontested elections of directors.
Accordingly, on July 9, 2012, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to Section 8 of the Company's Bylaws. These amendments provide that in an uncontested election of directors, if any nominee for director receives a greater number of "withhold" votes (ignoring abstentions and broker non-votes) than votes "for" his or her election, and the nominee is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors and all committees thereof, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken.
Under the amended Bylaws, in making its recommendation, the Governance Committee will consider all factors it deems relevant including, without limitation, the stated reasons why stockholders withheld votes for election from such director, the length of service and qualifications of such director, the director's contributions to the Company and the availability of other qualified candidates for director.
Under the amended Bylaws, the Governance Committee's evaluation shall begin promptly following certification of the voting results and shall be forwarded to the Board of Directors to permit the Board of Directors to act on it no later than ninety (90) days following the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. In reviewing the Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors evaluated by the Governance Committee and such additional information and factors as the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. If the Board of Directors determines that the director's resignation is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Board of Directors shall promptly accept the resignation. The Company shall publicly disclose the Board of Directors' decision within four business days on a Form 8-K, providing an explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for not requesting the director's resignation. Any director who is the subject of the evaluation described in this section shall not participate in the Governance Committee's or the Board of Directors' considerations of the appropriateness of his or her continued service, except to respond to requests for information. If a majority of the members of the Governance Committee are subject to this evaluation process, then the independent directors on the Board of Directors (as most recently determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to applicable listing guidelines) who are not subject to the evaluation shall appoint a special committee of the Board of Directors amongst themselves solely for the purpose of conducting the required evaluation. The special committee will make the recommendation to the Board of Directors otherwise required of the Governance Committee.
The foregoing description of these amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of Section 8, as revised, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.4 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.

The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the corporation in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act of such stockholder's intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting and such proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. No business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

in a proxy statement or other filings in connection with solicitations of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that any references in these bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or other proposals to be considered pursuant to this Section 5, and compliance with this Section 5 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other proposals at an annual meeting (other than, as provided in the third to last sentence of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, matters brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the 1934 Act). Nothing in this Section 5 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.
Section 6. .

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, (iii) the President, or (iv) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized Directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption), and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix.
(b) If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. If the notice is not given within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.
 
Section 7. . Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, date and hour and of the meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 222, 229).
Notice of Meetings
Section 8. .
Quorum and Voting
(a) At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions and any broker non-votes, at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in any Contested Election. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors in any Contested Election) of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 216). For purposes of these Bylaws, "Contested Election" shall mean the election of a director at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article III, Section 5(c) of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the tenth (10th) day before the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders.
(b) In any election of directors other than a Contested Election, if any nominee for director receives a greater number of "withhold" votes (ignoring abstentions and
 
broker non-votes) than votes "for" his or her election and the nominee is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors and all committees thereof, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. In making its recommendation, the Governance Committee will consider all factors it deems relevant including, without limitation, the following:
The stated reasons why stockholders withheld votes for election from such director;
The length of service and qualifications of such director;
The director's contributions to the corporation; and
The availability of other qualified candidates for director.
The Governance Committee's evaluation shall begin promptly following certification of the voting results and shall be forwarded to the Board of Directors to permit the Board of Directors to act on it no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting. In reviewing the Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors evaluated by the Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. If the Board of Directors determines that resignation is in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders, the Board of Directors shall promptly accept the resignation. The corporation shall publicly disclose the Board of Director's decision within four business days in a Form 8-K, providing an explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for not requesting the director's resignation. Any director who is the subject of the evaluation described in this section shall not participate in Governance Committee or Board of Directors considerations of the appropriateness of his or her continued service, except to respond to requests for information. If a majority of the members of the Governance Committee are subject to this evaluation process, then the independent directors on the Board of Directors (as most recently determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to applicable listing guidelines) who are not subject to the evaluation shall appoint a special committee of the Board of Directors amongst themselves solely for the purpose of conducting the required evaluation. The special committee will make the recommendation to the Board of Directors otherwise required of the Governance Committee.
Section 9. . Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares casting votes, excluding abstentions. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 222(c)).
Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings
Section 10. . For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in
Voting Rights
 
whose names shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote ay any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All elections of Directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 211(e), 212(b)).
Section 11. . If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 217(b)).
Joint Owners of Stock
Section 12. . The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.

Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot.

At the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, all Directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders.

Newly created Directorships resulting from any increase in the number of Directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of the Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any Director elected in accordance with this paragraph shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any Director, or if the stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which Directors are to be elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 21 below) to elect the number of Directors then constituting the whole Board of Directors. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 223(a), (b)).

In the event that the Board of Directors shall request the resignation of any Director in accordance with the Majority Vote Policy (or any successor to such policy) of the corporation's Corporate Governance Principles and Practices in effect from time to time, such Director shall promptly tender his or her resignation. Any failure to so tender such a resignation shall constitute grounds for removal of such Director for cause in accordance with Section 20 below. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 141(b), 223(d)).
Resignation
Section 20. . Subject to any limitations imposed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, or any individual Director, may be removed from office at any time (a) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of Directors; or (b) without cause by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such outstanding shares.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 213).
 
Section 38. . The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.
Execution of Other Securities
Section 40. . Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to law at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Sections 170, 173).
Declaration of Dividends
Section 41. . Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of
Dividend Reserve
 
the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, Section 171).
Section 42. . The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Fiscal Year
Section 43. .
Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees and Other Agents
(a) . The corporation shall indemnify its Directors, Senior Officers and Vice Presidents who are designated as Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents or Group Presidents (collectively with the Senior Officers, the "") to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its Directors and Designated Officers; and, provided, further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Director or Designated Officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against the corporation or its Directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation or (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Directors and Executive Officers
Designated Officers
(b) . The corporation shall have power to indemnify its officers other than Designated Officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
Junior Officers, Employees and Other Agents
(c) .
Good Faith
(1) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director or Designated Officer shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
(i) one or more officers or employees of the corporation as to the matters the Director or Designated Officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
 
(ii) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director or Designated Officer believed to be within such person's professional competence; and
(iii) a committee of the Board of Directors upon which such Director or Designated Officer does not serve, as to matters within such Committee's designated authority, which committee such Director or Designated Officer believes to merit confidence;
so long as, in each case, the Director or Designated Officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
(2) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
(d) . The corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director or Designated Officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
(e) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to Directors and Designated Officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the Director or Designated Officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director or Designated Officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense
Enforcement
 
to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
(g) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Rights
(h) . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.
Insurance
(i) . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
Amendments
(j) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director and Designated Officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

SAN DIEGO  July 18, 2012  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 ended June 24, 2012.
"Adoption of 3G and 3G/4G technologies continues around the world, driving strong year-over-year growth in our chipset and licensing businesses this quarter," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Looking forward, our growth estimates for 3G/4G device shipments in calendar 2012 have moderated slightly, and we now expect the demand profile of the calendar year to be more back-end loaded as new devices are launched for the holiday season. Although our outlook for semiconductor volumes in the fiscal fourth quarter has been reduced from our prior expectations, we are ramping supply of our 28 nanometer chipsets to help enable what we expect to be a strong December quarter for our semiconductor business."
Third Quarter Results (GAAP)*
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Third Quarter Results*
Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included within this news release.
* Note: The following should be considered with regard to the above results and comparisons - the second quarter of fiscal 2012 GAAP results included $761 million in earnings, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations (as a result of a $1.2 billion gain associated with the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum), as compared to a $3 million loss, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Additionally, the third quarter of fiscal 2012 GAAP and Non-GAAP results included Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., which was acquired on May 24, 2011, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 GAAP and Non-GAAP results which only included Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. from the date of the acquisition.
 
Third Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $20.2 billion a year ago and $26.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012. On July 6, 2012, we announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on September 26, 2012 to stockholders of record as of September 7, 2012. Since June 24, 2012, we repurchased and retired 11.3 million shares of our common stock for $617 million.
Research and Development
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased 26 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in investments in the development of integrated circuit products (including connectivity products), next-generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 16 percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in costs relating to legal matters, employee-related expenses and patent-related expenses.
Effective Income Tax Rates
Our estimated fiscal 2012 effective income tax rates increased to approximately 20 percent for both GAAP and Non-GAAP, as compared to our prior estimates of approximately 18 percent for GAAP and approximately 18 to 19 percent for Non-GAAP, primarily due to changes in our estimates related to foreign earnings taxed at rates that are less than the United States federal tax rate. As a result, the third quarter GAAP tax rate of 24 percent and Non-GAAP tax rate of 23 percent were higher than the expected annual effective tax rates.
Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. QSI also includes the discontinued operations of our FLO TV business. GAAP results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 included a $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
 
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company uses Non-GAAP financial information (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company: revenues, cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making.
 
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Certain share-based compensation is excluded because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing operational performance as they are deemed to be unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. Further, share-based compensation expense relates primarily to restricted stock and stock option awards. The fair values of share-based awards are affected by factors that are variable on each grant date, which may include the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected award life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are deemed to be unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. Certain tax items that were recorded in each fiscal year presented, but that were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended.
 
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

(e) On September 30, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company) amended the Companys Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (ERMCP) to simplify the formula for determining the amount of employee contributions the Company will match under the ERMCP. Effective with respect to deferrals of bonuses earned for services rendered for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2012, and deferrals of salary earned on or after January 1, 2013, Company matching contributions will be equal to 50% of each participating employees deferrals that do not exceed 16% of the employees salary and bonus paid in the calendar year. The revised formula does not result in a material change to the value of the Company match on an individual or aggregate basis. Additionally, the Compensation Committee amended the ERMCP, effective with respect to the deferrals of bonuses earned for services rendered for fiscal years beginning after October 1, 2012, and for deferrals of salary earned on and after January 1, 2014, to provide that Company matching contributions will be made in cash, unless the Compensation Committee decides that the match should be made in Company stock.
The Compensation Committee also amended the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to revise the limits on vesting of full value awards (e.g., restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and stock-based awards based on the full value of shares of Company common stock subject to the LTIP). Before the amendment, full value awards granted to employees that vest on the basis of the employees continued service with the Company could not vest more rapidly than annual pro-rata vesting over a three-year period and full value awards that vest upon attainment of performance goals were required to provide for a performance period of at least twelve months. These vesting limitations were subject to an exception that allowed a maximum of 2% of shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP to be issued as awards to non-employee directors without regard to these vesting limitations. The amendment to the LTIP expands the exception to the vesting limitations, effective September 30, 2012, to (a) allow a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP to be issued without regard to the vesting limitations, and (b) include awards issued to employees as well as awards issued to non-employee directors.

SAN DIEGO  November 7, 2012  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended September 30, 2012.
"I am very pleased with our performance this year. We delivered record revenues, earnings and MSM chipset shipments driven by increasing global consumption of wireless data across a diverse range of devices, particularly smartphones," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "As we continue to invest in and execute on our strategic priorities, our broad licensing program and industry-leading Snapdragon and 3G/LTE chipset roadmap position us for double-digit revenue growth again in fiscal 2013."
GAAP Results
Qualcomm's results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012*
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012*
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with GAAP and Non-GAAP results are included within this news release.
* The following should be considered in regards to the year-over-year comparisons: Fiscal 2012 GAAP results included $776 million in earnings, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations (primarily a result of a $1.2 billion gain associated with the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum), as compared to a $313 million loss, net of income taxes, for discontinued operations in fiscal 2011. Additionally, fiscal 2012 GAAP and Non-GAAP results included Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., which was acquired on May 24, 2011, as compared to fiscal 2011 GAAP and Non-GAAP results, which only included Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. from the date of the acquisition. Fiscal 2011 operating and free cash flows reflected the impact of a $1.5 billion income tax payment primarily related to license and settlement agreements entered into in fiscal 2008.
Key Business Metrics
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012
 
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $20.9 billion a year ago and $26.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012. On October 17, 2012, we announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on December 21, 2012 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2012. Since September 30, 2012, we repurchased and retired 4.1 million shares of common stock for $240 million.
Research and Development
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased 31 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of CDMA-based 3G, OFDMA-based 4G LTE and other technologies for integrated circuit and related software products and to expand our intellectual property portfolio.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 47 percent y-o-y primarily due to a long-lived asset impairment charge related to our QMT division and increases in employee-related expenses, costs relating to legal matters, selling and marketing expenses and patent-related expenses.
Effective Income Tax Rates
Our fiscal 2012 effective income tax rates were 19 percent for GAAP and 20 percent for Non-GAAP. The fiscal 2012 GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates only reflect the United States federal R&D credit generated through December 31, 2011, the date on which the credit expired. The fiscal 2012 GAAP effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $10 million related to the completion of the audit of our fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2008 state tax returns. This tax benefit was excluded from our Non-GAAP results.
QSI Segment
QSI makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. QSI also includes the discontinued operations of our FLO TV business. GAAP results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 included $0.01 earnings per share for QSI.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
 
 
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company uses Non-GAAP financial information (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QCT, QTL and QWI segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company: revenues, cost of
 
revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes QSI, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

First Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP First Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included within this news release.
First Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $28.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $22.0 billion a year ago and $26.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. On January 15, 2013, we announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on March 27, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2013.
 
Research and Development
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased 27 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of CDMA-based 3G, OFDMA-based 4G LTE and other technologies for integrated circuit and related software products and to expand our intellectual property portfolio.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 23 percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and costs relating to legal matters.
Effective Income Tax Rates
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the effective income tax rates for GAAP and Non-GAAP were both 18 percent. Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, our fiscal 2013 annual effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 16 percent for GAAP and
 
approximately 17 to 18 percent for Non-GAAP, which include the recent retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit. The R&D tax credit benefit related to fiscal 2012 that will be recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 will be excluded from Non-GAAP results.
QSI Segment
QSI makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 included $0.01 loss per share for QSI.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company uses Non-GAAP financial information (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QCT, QTL and QWI segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company: revenues, cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on
 
Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes QSI, certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

ir@qualcomm.com
SAN DIEGO  April 24, 2013  Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 ended March 31, 2013.
"We delivered another strong quarter as the worldwide adoption of smartphones continues," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "Looking forward, we are seeing strong traction with our new Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and 800 processors, and we continue to expect healthy growth in 3G and 3G/4G multimode devices around the world. We are pleased to be raising our calendar 2013 3G/4G device shipment estimates and our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2013."
Second Quarter Results (GAAP)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Second Quarter Results
Non-GAAP results exclude the QSI segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items and tax items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included within this news release.
Second Quarter Key Business Metrics
 
 
 
Cash and Marketable Securities
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $30.5 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $26.6 billion a year ago and $28.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013. On April 9, 2013, we announced a cash dividend of $0.35 per share payable on June 26, 2013 to stockholders of record as of June 5, 2013, which represents a 40 percent increase over our prior quarterly dividend.
 
 
Research and Development
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased 28 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in costs related to the development of CDMA-based 3G, OFDMA-based 4G LTE and other technologies for integrated circuit and related software products and to expand our intellectual property portfolio.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
N/M - Not Meaningful
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14 percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses, patent-related expenses and selling and marketing expenses.
Effective Income Tax Rates
Our fiscal 2013 annual effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 16 percent for GAAP and approximately 17 to 18 percent for Non-GAAP. The second quarter effective income tax rates were 13 percent for GAAP and 16 percent for Non-GAAP, which are lower than the estimated annual effective tax rates primarily as a result of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit during the second quarter. The federal R&D tax credit benefit that related to fiscal 2012 of $0.04 per share was excluded from Non-GAAP results.
 
 
QSI Segment
QSI makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage companies, and holds wireless spectrum. GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 included $0.02 earnings per share for QSI.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide a more complete description of risks.
Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may vary materially from the business outlook.
The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current business outlook. The Non-GAAP business outlook presented below is consistent with the presentation of Non-GAAP results included elsewhere herein.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sums may not equal totals due to rounding.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.
The Company uses Non-GAAP financial information (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QCT, QTL and QWI segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company: revenues, cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company
 
 
and its business segments. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making.
Non-GAAP information used by management excludes QSI and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items and tax items.
 
 
 
 
The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is
 
 
available to grow its business and to create long-term stockholder value. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
