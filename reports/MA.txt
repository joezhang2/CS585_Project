Only actual, as opposed to estimated, Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) and Gross Acquiring Volume (GAV) and Revenues Paid information will be used in determining the Global Proxy Calculation for each stockholder. 3

"Revenues Paid" for any period means, with respect to a particular stockholder, all revenues of the Corporation on a consolidated basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that are generated by the activities of that stockholder, other than (1) any fees or other charges associated with the termination of that stockholder's membership in MasterCard International Incorporated, (2) Integration Assessments (as defined in Section 4(d) of Article VI of the Bylaws of MasterCard International Incorporated) paid by that stockholder, (3) other assessments, fees and charges paid by that stockholder in its capacity as a member of MasterCard International Incorporated if those assessments, fees or charges were imposed on less than all of the members of MasterCard International Incorporated (except for assessments, fees and charges pertaining to business development, ordinary course of business and other matters deemed to be includable by the management of MasterCard International Incorporated in its sole discretion) and (4) fines and penalties paid by that stockholder (except as determined in the sole discretion of the management of MasterCard International Incorporated).

Type 1A shall include 75% of all ec Picto(R) volumes and other similar debit volumes that in each case have been converted to Maestro(R) volumes so long as Maestro(R), a Permitted Purse Brand and/or Cirrus(R) is the sole acceptance brand on the card and the card is subject to card fee assessments. c. Type 2 shall include the following percentages of all volumes for regional debit brands owned (or in the case of the initial allocation of shares to be owned) solely by the Corporation on cards that include a Maestro(R) and/or Cirrus(R) logo; provided that such cards are subject to volume-based assessments or card fee assessments; and provided, further, that for calculations for the last year of the Transition Period through the year ending on the second anniversary of the end of the Transition Period, there is a binding written commitment to remove all acceptance brand logos, other than the Maestro(R) brand logo, the Cirrus(R) brand logo or a Permitted Purse Brand logo, on the cards not later than the fifth anniversary of the first fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter in which the Closing Date occurs: (i) 40% of such volumes for the last year of the Transition Period; (ii) 30% of such volumes for the year ending on the one-year anniversary of the end of the Transition Period; (iii) 20% of such volumes for the year ending on the two-year anniversary of the end of the Transition Period; and (iv) 10% of such volumes for subsequent years. d.

Thereafter, ec Picto(R) Volumes shall be accorded the weighting determined in accordance with the definitions of the Types of Volumes described above. For each Global Proxy Calculation, all Volumes described above will be included in calculating Gross Dollar Volume and Gross Acquiring Volume whether those Volumes are assessed directly or the cards to which they relate are subject to card fee assessments of the type contemplated by the applicable type of Volume. In addition, for each Global Proxy Calculation performed prior to the expiration of the Transition Period, Volumes of the types described above will be included even if they are not subject to volume-based or card fee assessments. 5
"Permitted Purse Brand" means a brand representing a stored value application that is permitted to be used by members of MasterCard International Incorporated under the Bylaws and Rules of MasterCard International Incorporated. For purposes of determining the Global Proxy Calculation, the conversion of Euros into U.S. dollars will be based on the average exchange rate during the twenty-day period ending on the day prior to the applicable measurement date (the "Prevailing Exchange Rate"), provided that during the Transition Period and for two years thereafter, the Prevailing Exchange Rate shall be $.9565 U.S. = 1 Euro for so long as 1 Euro is not less than $.9065 U.S. and not greater than $1.0065 U.S. (the "Currency Conversion Band"). In the event that the Prevailing Exchange Rate does not fall within the Currency Conversion Band, the currency conversion rate to convert Euros to U.S. Dollars will be $.9565 adjusted by the difference between such Prevailing Exchange Rate and the upper/lower limit of the Currency Conversion Band, as applicable. For purposes of determining the Global Proxy Calculation during the Transition Period and for the two years thereafter, amounts denominated in the currency of a country within the Europe Region (as defined in the Integration Agreement) other than the Euro shall be converted into Euros and subsequently converted into U.S. dollars in accordance with the previous paragraph. Class A shares and Class B shares may be held only by Class A members of MasterCard International Incorporated and, with the prior approval of the Board of Directors, their Designated Affiliates. A Designated Affiliate of a Class A member is an Affiliate (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) of the Class A member to whom the Class A member transfers its stock in the Corporation in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements that prohibit the Class A member from holding stock in the Corporation. No fractional shares of Class A Stock or Class B Stock shall be issued or delivered by the Corporation, and any fractional share interests shall be rounded in such manner as the management of the Corporation shall determine in its sole discretion. Section 3. During the Transition Period, no shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or assigned (including any assignment of the right to receive shares) except that (i) a stockholder may sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of its shares to the acquirer of its card portfolio in connection with a transfer by a stockholder of all or substantially all of such stockholder's card portfolio, (ii) if a stockholder that was a principal member becomes an affiliate member of another principal member, such stockholder may sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of its shares to the principal member with whom it becomes affiliated, (iii) if a stockholder that was a principal member and had one or more affiliate members ceases to be a principal member and one or more of its affiliate members thereupon become principal members, such stockholder may sell, transfer, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of its shares to such former affiliate members, (iv) if a stockholder is prohibited by applicable regulatory requirements from holding stock in the Corporation, such stockholder may sell transfer, pledge, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of its shares to a Designated Affiliate so long as the Board of Directors has given its prior approval to the transaction; and (v) a stockholder may sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of its shares to a Class A member that is an affiliate of such stockholder so long as the Board of Directors has given its prior approval to the transaction; provided, however that for the purposes of this clause (v), the term "affiliate" shall be deemed to mean any parent company that directly or indirectly owns 80% or 6
more of the voting power and economic interests in such stockholder, and any entity of which such stockholder or any of such parents owns 80% or more of the voting power and economic interests. If, during the Transition Period, a stockholder ceases to be a member of MasterCard International Incorporated (voluntarily or otherwise), such stockholder's shares in the Corporation shall be transferred to the Corporation from such stockholder at a cost to the Corporation equal to the aggregate par value of the shares transferred to the Corporation, effective as of the first business day after the date such stockholder's membership in MasterCard International Incorporated was terminated. If, following the expiration of the Transition Period, a stockholder ceases to be a member of MasterCard International Incorporated (voluntarily or otherwise), the Corporation shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to elect to direct such stockholder to transfer to the Corporation for cash all of such stockholder's shares for an amount equal to the book value of such stockholder's shares based on the Corporation's financial statements most recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Corporation shall make such election by delivering a written notice to such stockholder within 20 days after such stockholder's membership in MasterCard International Incorporated was terminated. If the Corporation makes such election, then the Corporation shall deliver the payment price in cash to such stockholder within 20 days after delivering its written election notice. Upon delivery of the payment price, all of such stockholder's rights as a stockholder of the Corporation shall immediately cease. In the event that the Corporation does not make such election, such stockholder will be required to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 4. Section 4. An entity that became or becomes a Class A member of MasterCard International Incorporated from and after January 1, 2001 until the end of the Transition Period shall be eligible to be allocated Class A shares as of the end of the Transition Period based upon its Global Proxy Calculation in accordance with such procedures as may be determined by the Board. From and after the end of the Transition Period, each stockholder shall be free to sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or assign (including any assignment of the right to receive shares), as applicable, its shares to any person permitted to hold such shares. Following the expiration of the Transition Period, each stockholder must maintain an ownership percentage of the Corporation's outstanding common stock that is no less than 75% and no more than 125% of the percentage represented by such stockholder's most recent Global Proxy Calculation by purchasing or selling shares, if necessary, in accordance with procedures to be established by the Board of Directors within 12 months after receiving notice from the Corporation that such stockholder is not in compliance with this section. If a stockholder holds shares as the result of a transfer made pursuant to clauses (iv) or (v) of the first sentence of Article III, Section 3 of these Bylaws, then the percentage ownership test described in the preceding sentence shall be calculated based upon the aggregate Global Proxy Calculation of the stockholder and the Class A member(s) that transferred shares to the stockholder. If a stockholder is unable to satisfy the requirement that it own no more than 125% of the percentage represented by such stockholder's most recent Global Proxy Calculation, the selling stockholder shall be obligated to accept the highest price offered to such stockholder for such number of shares of Common Stock as is necessary to enable such stockholder to satisfy such requirement. Section 5. The Board of Directors shall establish procedures for the purchase or sale of shares following the expiration of the Transition Period. ARTICLE IV Board of Directors Section 1. The business of the Corporation will be managed by the Board of Directors, which may exercise all of the powers of the Corporation and do all lawful acts and things as are not 7

After the Transition Period, the President and Chief Executive Officer shall be a Director and the remaining Directors shall be apportioned among officers of stockholders from the Corporation's regions in accordance with the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding stock owned by the stockholders of each such region, subject to Article EIGHTH of the Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that in calculating the percentage of outstanding stock owned by the stockholders of each region, transfers of shares made pursuant to clauses (iv) or (v) of the first sentence of ARTICLE III, Section 3 of these Bylaws shall be disregarded. As used in these Bylaws, the phrase "entire Board of Directors" shall mean the total number of directors, other than honorary members of the Board of Directors (if any), that the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. Section 3. There shall not be more than two representatives from any one Class A member of MasterCard International Incorporated, including its Affiliates and its affiliate members of MasterCard International Incorporated that are sponsored by such Class A member, on the Board of Directors. Section 4. No individual may serve as a Director of the Corporation or of any regional board if that individual also is a director (including a regional board director), officer or other employee of or consultant to a competitor of the Corporation, or if that individual is a director, officer or other employee of or consultant to an institution that is represented on the global board of directors or U.S. regional board of directors of a competitor. For this purpose, a competitor of the Corporation is an entity that owns and/or operates a payment card program competitive with the Corporation's comparable card programs, as determined by the Corporation, and that is not itself a stockholder of the Corporation. Section 5. During the Transition Period, the regional president of Europe and, if approved by the Board of Directors, one officer of the Corporation other than the President and Chief Executive Officer, shall serve as honorary members of the Board of Directors and shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Board of Directors and shall be permitted to attend and participate in all meetings of the Board of Directors, but shall not be entitled to vote.

If no resolution is reached promptly, the Corporation's Nominating Committee shall present its recommended slate of Directors to the Board of Directors and shall advise the Board of Directors of any disagreement with respect to the nominees from any specific region.

Section 8. The term of any Director who, after election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, subsequently fails to meet the requirements of Sections 2, 3 or 4 of this ARTICLE IV or Article EIGHTH of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, shall terminate automatically at the time that the Director so failed to qualify; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may appoint that terminated Director to fill the vacancy caused by the termination until the next annual meeting of stockholders unless such termination resulted from the failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 4 of this ARTICLE IV or Article EIGHTH of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation. Section 9. A vacancy in the Board of Directors, by reason of an increase in the number of Directors or by reason of the death, resignation, removal or termination of the term of a director, may be filled by the Board of Directors in a manner consistent with the requirements of Sections 2, 3, and 4 of this ARTICLE IV and Article EIGHTH of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation. Each Director shall hold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until the Director's earlier death, resignation, removal or automatic termination of his term. A Director may resign at any time by written notice to the Corporation addressed to the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary. ARTICLE V Meetings of the Board of Directors Section 1.

Section 4. Whenever notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors is required, the notice shall be given in the manner set forth in ARTICLE XV of these Bylaws and shall state the purpose or purposes, place, date and hour of the meeting.

Section 6. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or the committee, as the case may be, who are entitled to vote, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or of that committee.

Any decision of a regional board, to the extent such decision is within the scope of power and authority delegated to such regional board by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, shall be effective unless and until the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in accordance with Section 2 of ARTICLE VI, determines otherwise, provided that the approval or adoption of any action, rule or policy that could be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, to have an effect in more than one region or that in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation is inconsistent with a published policy, practice or strategy of the Corporation, shall not become effective (or shall be declared ineffective if already in effect) unless and until such action, rule or policy has been ratified by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Only the Corporation's management shall be authorized to enter into a business arrangement with a stockholder or a member of MasterCard International Incorporated that it can be reasonably be determined will relate to activities that will be conducted in, or have an effect in, more than one region, subject to any parameters as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 3. During the first year of the existence of the Debit Advisory Board, the Debit Advisory Board shall be comprised of the members of the Board of Directors of Maestro International Incorporated in effect upon the date of adoption of these Bylaws. The Nominating Committee will nominate individuals to serve as members of the Debit Advisory Board beginning with the second year of the Debit Advisory Board for approval by the Board of Directors. In selecting nominees for service on the Debit Advisory Board, the Nominating Committee will give due consideration to representatives from key stockholders of the Corporation that support the Corporation's debit products, as measured by the Global Proxy Calculation. Prior to presenting such nominations, the Nominating Committee shall seek recommendations for candidates for the Debit Advisory Board from the regional boards and shall duly consider all such recommendations. In the event of a disagreement between a regional board and the Nominating Committee with respect to a nominee(s) from that region, the chairman of the regional board and the Nominating Committee shall attempt to resolve the dispute through direct consultation. If no resolution is reached promptly, the Nominating Committee shall present its recommended slate of Nominating Committee members and shall advise the Board of Directors of any disagreement with respect to the nominees from any specific region. The Board of Directors shall make the final determination with respect to any dispute regarding a regional nominee. Section 4. Any recommendation of the Debit Advisory Board, to the extent such recommendation is within the scope of power and authority delegated to the Debit Advisory Board by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and is not inconsistent with a published policy, practice or procedure, shall be effective unless and until the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in accordance with Section 2(f) of ARTICLE VI, overrules such recommendation.

Section 3. Any or all signatures upon a certificate may be a facsimile. Even if an officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall cease to be that officer, transfer agent or registrar before the certificate is issued, that certificate may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she or it were that officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Section 4. The Board of Directors may direct that a new certificate be issued in place of any certificate issued by the Corporation that is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. When doing so, the Board of Directors may prescribe such terms and conditions precedent to the issuance of the new certificate as it deems expedient, and may require a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it with regard to the allegedly lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the issuance of the new certificate. Section 5. The Corporation or a transfer agent of the Corporation, upon surrender to it of a certificate representing shares, duly endorsed and accompanied by proper evidence of lawful succession, assignment or authority of transfer, shall issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, and shall cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon the books of the Corporation.

ARTICLE XII Indemnification Section 1. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Section 2. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Section 3. To the extent that a present or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this ARTICLE, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection therewith. Section 4. Any indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this ARTICLE (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2. Such determination will be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee or such Directors designated by majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (compensated by the Corporation) in a written opinion or (4) by the stockholders. Section 5. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any director, officer, employee or agent in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or threat thereof, may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this ARTICLE. Such expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a former director, officer, employee or agent may be paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate. 19
Section 6. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this ARTICLE shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Section 7. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this ARTICLE. Section 8. References in this ARTICLE to "the Corporation" will include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, will stand in the same position under the provisions of this ARTICLE with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. Section 9. For purposes of this ARTICLE, references to "other enterprises" will include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" will include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary of the Corporation and any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan will be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this ARTICLE. Section 10. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this ARTICLE shall, unless otherwise provided, when authorized or ratified continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. Section 11. Except as specifically permitted by applicable law, no person who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or member of any committee of the Corporation shall be indemnified in any way if such person has brought the action or proceeding against the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees, agents or any committee of the Corporation. Section 12. The provisions of this ARTICLE will be deemed retroactive and will include all acts of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Corporation since the date of incorporation. 20

THE CONVERSION OVERVIEW OF THE CONVERSION The conversion refers to the process by which MasterCard International will merge with a subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, a newly formed stock holding company. After the conversion, MasterCard International will continue as a non-stock corporation and the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, which will own the sole class B membership interest of MasterCard International. In the conversion, each principal member of MasterCard International will receive shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated representing that member's equity interest in MasterCard Incorporated, and a class A membership interest in MasterCard International representing that member's continued rights as a licensee to use MasterCard's brands, programs and services. MasterCard International's rules and standards will not be affected by the conversion and integration. We expect that the conversion will be completed as soon as practicable after the conditions to conversion are satisfied, including approval of the conversion by the members and the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act. We anticipate that these conditions will be satisfied and that the conversion will be completed in the first half of 2002. EFFECTS OF THE CONVERSION As a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated, you will have the right to vote on all matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote, including the election of the board of directors, and extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets or dissolution of MasterCard Incorporated. In any vote for the election of directors, no stockholder, together with its affiliates, will be entitled to vote more than 7% of the outstanding shares that are entitled to vote in that election. The board of directors of MasterCard International is required to be the same as the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated. You will have the right to vote on proposed changes to Article I (Membership) of the bylaws of MasterCard International, but you will no longer be entitled to vote with respect to any other amendments of the charter or bylaws of MasterCard International. The rules for the qualification of members of MasterCard International will be the same as the current rules for the qualification of members of MasterCard International. The directors and executive officers of MasterCard Incorporated after the conversion and integration will be the same as the directors and executive officers of MasterCard International before the conversion except for the addition of two voting directors who will be affiliated with European members and the addition of Dr. Peter Hoch, currently Chief Executive Officer of Europay, who will be President of MasterCard's Europe region (an officer of MasterCard Incorporated) and a non-voting director. In particular, if the conversion is approved, the current directors of MasterCard International will serve as the directors of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International until the annual meeting of MasterCard Incorporated shareholders in 2003. In addition, the boards of directors of each company, acting pursuant to authority granted to them in their respective certificates of incorporation and/or bylaws, will appoint two additional voting directors affiliated with European members and Dr. Peter Hoch as a non-voting director, in each case to serve until the annual meeting of MasterCard Incorporated shareholders in 2003. The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated will be subject to reelection in 2003. If the conversion does not occur, the current directors of MasterCard International will continue in that capacity until an annual meeting of MasterCard International principal members is held in 2003. The bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated provide that during the three year transition period following the closing of the conversion and integration: - one-third of the members of MasterCard Incorporated's board of directors will be representatives of MasterCard Incorporated's European stockholders; - one-third of the members of MasterCard Incorporated's board of directors will be representatives of MasterCard Incorporated's U.S. stockholders; - the President and Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard Incorporated will be a director; and 35
- the remaining directors will be apportioned among the other regions in accordance with the percentage of common stock owned by the stockholders of those regions. After the three-year transition period, the President and Chief Executive Officer will continue to be a director and all other directors will be apportioned among the regions according to each region's respective share of the aggregate vote. The integration agreement provides that the allocation of one-third of the board seats to Europe during the transition period may not be altered. The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated will initially consist of 18 voting members -- six from the U.S., six from Europe, three from Asia/Pacific, one from Canada, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and the President and Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard Incorporated. The directors will be elected by the class A and class B stockholders, voting together as a single class (so long as the class B convertible shares are entitled to vote), with each share entitled to one vote, subject to the following limitations: - no more than two representatives from any member (including its affiliates and affiliate members) may sit on the board of directors; - no single stockholder, together with its affiliates, may exercise more than 7% of the voting power in any election of directors; and - no more than one-third of the board of directors may be representatives from a single region. In addition to the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors, there will be a regional board for each of MasterCard's six operating regions: Asia/Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East/Africa and the United States. Each of the regional boards will be elected by the members from that region. Decisions to establish or eliminate a regional board or overrule one of its decisions must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of the board of directors. In addition, all of the regions will have a regional president, who will be selected by the President and Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard Incorporated in concurrence with the regional board (or otherwise with a two-thirds majority of the global board of directors). MasterCard Incorporated will also establish a Debit Advisory Board to provide guidance with respect to the ongoing development of MasterCard's debit programs. The powers and responsibilities of the regional boards following the conversion and integration are expected to be substantially similar to the powers and responsibilities of those boards before the conversion and integration. For a description of the supermajority requirements necessary to revise these governance arrangements, see "Comparison of Rights of MasterCard International Members Before and After the Conversion and Integration -- Vote on Extraordinary Transactions/Supermajority Voting Provisions." CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION In approving the conversion and recommending that you approve the conversion, our board of directors considered a number of advantages of the new structure. By creating a new holding company, MasterCard Incorporated, which will own MasterCard International, we expect to realize many of the advantages of a stock corporation at the holding company level, while maintaining the flexibility of a membership association in governing the operations of our global payments programs at the subsidiary level. As is typical of a holding company structure, the holding company, MasterCard Incorporated, will control the voting power of its operating subsidiary, MasterCard International, with regard to all items that require a vote of MasterCard International's members, except for amendments to Article I (Membership) of the bylaws. We believe that the conversion will enhance the value of our business and our future opportunities by providing us some of the benefits of being a public company. Specifically, we believe that the conversion will: - permit member-stockholders to realize the value of their investment in MasterCard as an asset and, subject to certain restrictions, trade MasterCard Incorporated shares among themselves; - align more closely the interests of MasterCard and our member-stockholders. As member-stockholders increase their MasterCard business, their relative shareholdings in MasterCard Incorporated may increase; 36
- provide a more flexible structure to respond to opportunities in the marketplace, for example, by permitting us to complete the integration with Europay more efficiently since Europay already has capital stock outstanding or by permitting us to use our class C common stock as acquisition currency in future acquisitions; - result in greater financial transparency for our member-stockholders, since after the conversion MasterCard Incorporated will report financial and business information on a quarterly basis in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations; and - make it easier, if desired, for MasterCard Incorporated to raise financing in the public securities markets to fund technological innovations and other projects since MasterCard Incorporated will be a public reporting company. In approving the conversion and recommending that you approve the conversion, our board of directors also considered potential disadvantages of the new structure. Specifically, it is possible that: - a market for MasterCard Incorporated common stock may not develop sufficiently to provide member-stockholders with enough liquidity in trading their shares; - stockholders may be required to purchase or sell shares of MasterCard Incorporated in order to satisfy certain requirements, which may be disadvantageous to them; - the conversion will facilitate future strategic transactions that could reduce the influence of current MasterCard International members; - MasterCard Incorporated and certain member-stockholders will be subject to additional regulatory burdens, including Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, as a result of the conversion; and - the conversion could subject some members to tax liabilities. No director or officer or any of their affiliates has a substantial interest, direct or indirect, in the conversion. BOARD OF DIRECTORS' AND PRINCIPAL MEMBERS' APPROVAL On February 8, 2001, the board of directors of MasterCard International approved resolutions recommending the conversion to MasterCard International's members. Approval at the special meeting of at least a majority of voting power of MasterCard International's principal members is required to complete the plan of conversion; the quorum for the special meeting is the presence in person or by proxy of members representing a majority of the votes eligible to be cast. Notwithstanding member approval, however, the plan of conversion will not be completed if the integration will not also be completed. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE PLAN OF CONVERSION. THE MERGER AGREEMENT EFFECTING THE CONVERSION We summarize below the material terms and other provisions of the merger agreement. The description is not complete, and we refer you to the merger agreement, which is contained in Annex A of this proxy statement-prospectus and which we have filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus is a part. CONVERSION OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS The conversion will be effected pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into among MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International and MasterCard Merger Sub, Inc., which we refer to as the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides for the merger of MasterCard International and MasterCard Merger Sub, Inc. under Delaware law, with MasterCard International being the surviving entity. Under the merger agreement, each issued and outstanding principal membership interest in MasterCard International will be automatically converted by virtue of the merger into a class A membership interest of MasterCard International and a specified number of shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. The number of shares of class A redeemable and 37
class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated that a principal member receives in the merger will be proportional to the percentage of the total voting power of MasterCard International that such member held in accordance with the historic global proxy formula in effect for the period ended September 30, 2000. Upon completion of the conversion and integration and as an integral component thereof, the shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated will initially be reallocated within each of the European and non-European member-stockholder groups in accordance with the new global proxy formula based on the 12 month period ended December 31, 2000. Accordingly, the new global proxy formula, applied on a regional basis, will determine the number of shares that members actually receive in the conversion and integration. Class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock are fully paid, non-assessable voting equity interests in MasterCard Incorporated. The class A membership interest in MasterCard International represents the member's continued rights as a licensee to use MasterCard's brands, programs and services and participate in the MasterCard system. For a description of the allocation of shares resulting from the conversion and integration, see "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." Under the merger agreement, MasterCard Incorporated will receive the sole outstanding class B membership interest in MasterCard International, which will entitle MasterCard Incorporated to substantially all of the voting power, and all economic rights, in MasterCard International. MasterCard Incorporated's stockholders will participate indirectly in the voting power of, and economic rights associated with, the class B membership interest through their ownership of the class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. The merger will not close, and your existing membership interest will not be modified as described above, unless a majority of the voting power of MasterCard International's principal members at a meeting at which a quorum is present approve the conversion and the merger agreement. The board of directors of each of MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International and MasterCard Merger Sub, Inc. may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the conversion whether before or after the approval of the members of MasterCard International. APPLICATION OF THE SECURITIES LAWS TO SHARES RECEIVED As a result of the conversion, stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated will be subject to various provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Pursuant to Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, all stockholders will be prohibited from trading MasterCard Incorporated shares while in possession of any material, non-public information about MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, certain significant stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated may be required to file public reports with respect to their stockholdings. Other reporting obligations may also apply. Responsibility for compliance with these laws will reside with the applicable stockholder, not MasterCard Incorporated. APPLICATION OF U.S. BANKING REGULATIONS TO SHARES RECEIVED Banking regulations in the United States govern, among other things, the types of equity investments that regulated institutions are permitted to make. For a description of the potential application of federal and state banking regulations to the shares received in the conversion, see "Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Conversion -- U.S. banking regulations may impact our principal members' ownership of the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated." ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE CONVERSION We anticipate that upon our conversion to a stock corporation, our retained earnings will be reallocated to capital stock and additional paid-in capital on issuance of common stock to members in exchange for their member interests. This treatment is consistent with accounting for demutualizations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. With respect to the manner in which they account for their equity interest in MasterCard, members should consult their financial advisors regarding the potential accounting implications of the conversion. 38
THE INTEGRATION OVERVIEW OF THE INTEGRATION The integration refers to the acquisition of Europay by MasterCard Incorporated and the integration of the businesses of Europay and MasterCard International. In the integration, Europay's shareholders other than MasterCard International and MEPUK will exchange their Europay shares (and shareholders of MEPUK will exchange their MEPUK shares) for shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. For a description of the allocation of shares resulting from the conversion and integration, see "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." BACKGROUND OF THE INTEGRATION History. MasterCard International has a long-standing relationship with Europay, originating with Eurocard International's alliance with Interbank Card Association, MasterCard's predecessor, in 1968. In 1996, MasterCard International and Europay entered into an alliance agreement under which MasterCard International delegated to Europay the authority to manage the MasterCard brand in Europe and to process the licensing of MasterCard's brands to European financial institutions. MasterCard International and Europay established Maestro International, a joint venture, in 1991 to oversee the global development of the Maestro debit service, and entered into an agreement regarding the Maestro brand in 1997 to further strengthen their cooperation in this area. Each of MasterCard International and Europay own a 50% interest in Maestro International Incorporated, a Delaware corporation which owns the Maestro brand. MasterCard International currently owns approximately 12.25% of the capital stock of Europay and 15.0% of the capital stock of European Payment Systems Services (EPSS), Europay's transaction processing subsidiary. Together, these interests represent an approximate 15% interest in Europay on a consolidated basis. In addition, European members currently own approximately 7% of the total voting power, and related economic rights, of MasterCard International. Early Negotiations. As the MasterCard-Europay relationship developed, the managements of the organizations came to believe that they could significantly enhance the value of their alliance if they more fully integrated their organizations and focused their combined efforts on promoting a core set of global brands and services. In November 1999, a subcommittee of the MasterCard International board of directors authorized management to retain the services of Mercer Management Consulting to advise the board on revisions to MasterCard's corporate governance structure. Among other things, the board charged Mercer with the task of evaluating the existing MasterCard/Europay alliance. During a period of five months, representatives of Mercer met with members of the management teams of both parties and members of their respective boards of directors. The purpose of these meetings was to gather information about the working relationship of the parties and to assess whether improvements could and should be made. At a meeting of MasterCard International's board held on March 23, 2000, representatives of Mercer reported that, while the relationship between MasterCard International and Europay under the alliance agreement was generally positive, the parties would be better served by combining their organizations, aligning their interests more directly, focusing their considerable combined resources on promoting MasterCard's core brands and eliminating duplicative functions. On March 23, 2000, the MasterCard International board authorized the formation of a committee consisting of Donald L. Boudreau, MasterCard International's then Chairman, and Robert W. Pearce, a director, to enter into preliminary discussions about the possibility of integrating the organizations. On April 13, 2000, the board of directors of Europay designated a counterpart committee consisting of Dr. Kurt Richolt, Europay's then Chairman, Dr. Wolfgang Klein, then a director of Europay, and Baldomero Falcones Jaquotot, a director of Europay and MasterCard International. The negotiating committees first met on April 14, 2000. A second meeting was held on April 26, 2000. At these initial meetings, the committee members discussed the framework for a possible integration, including structural alternatives. No formal proposals regarding valuation or the type and amount of consideration to be issued to the stockholders of Europay were discussed at these initial meetings, although it was generally understood that the consideration would include some form of equity, rather than cash. Further meetings were held in May 2000 and in June 2000 (by teleconference). These meetings focused primarily on issues of 39
consideration. At the June 2000 meeting, the negotiating committees discussed the first draft of a term sheet that had been prepared by Mercer. In particular, the parties discussed the relative contribution that Europay's members would make to the revenues and transaction volume of a combined organization. Europay's view was that, based on a contribution analysis, the European members should be entitled to 33 1/3% of the equity in the combined company. MasterCard wanted to study further the level of contribution that Europay was likely to make and, in particular, the likelihood that transaction volume associated with Europay's regional ec Pictogram brand would be converted to Maestro transaction volume in the future. Later Negotiations. In July 2000, the boards of directors of MasterCard International and Europay reviewed the progress that had been achieved by the negotiating committees. At these meetings, representatives of Mercer presented a report summarizing the work of the negotiating committees to date. At its July 27, 2000 meeting, the MasterCard International board authorized the MasterCard negotiating committee to continue its work. Following these board meetings, the Europay negotiating team advised the MasterCard International team that the Europay shareholders strongly favored a stock conversion and viewed it as a critical part of the overall transaction. MasterCard was amenable to the concept of a stock conversion, subject to review of the potential tax, securities laws and other consequences. Each of MasterCard International and Europay retained financial advisers to assist the negotiating teams in analyzing the companies and to advise them with respect to valuation matters. MasterCard retained Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (subsequently Credit Suisse First Boston or CSFB). Europay retained Merrill Lynch & Co. Mercer was instructed to prepare and circulate a confidential term sheet. In September 2000, Mr. Boudreau and Dr. Richolt met by teleconference. They primarily discussed the formula for the global proxy calculation, which would become the benchmark for measuring the level of contribution made by the European members to the combined company. The full negotiating teams met three times in October 2000. Beginning with the second of these meetings, Robert Selander, MasterCard's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Peter Hoch, Europay's Chief Executive Officer, joined the negotiating teams. During these meetings, the negotiating committees discussed a wide range of strategic and operational issues, including the following: - the valuations of the organizations on a stand-alone and combined basis; - ways of measuring the relative contribution of the European members of MasterCard International to the business of the combined company; - the merits of a global proxy formula that recognized contributions to MasterCard International's gross dollar volume and gross acquiring volume compared to a formula that was strictly revenue-based; - the composition of the board of directors of the combined organization; - the level of authority that should be delegated to the regional boards and management; - the types of fundamental corporate matters that should not be changed without the approval of a supermajority of the board of directors or stockholders; - limitations on the assessability of memberships; - the benefits and detriments associated with converting MasterCard International to a stock corporation; and - the merits of a holding company structure. As the parties sought to reach a mutually acceptable understanding with respect to the consideration to be received by the European members, they concluded that it would be appropriate to implement a limited transition period during which the projected level of contribution made to MasterCard's revenues and transaction volume by the European members, as measured under the new global proxy calculation, would be applied. The parties decided that the European members would receive at the closing shares in a percentage amount that represented what their contribution, as measured by the new global proxy calculation, would have been if all of their volume were converted to MasterCard and Maestro brand volumes. In its consideration of the aggregate allocation of shares of MasterCard Incorporated between European and non-European members that would result from the integration, MasterCard management developed a model to project the final relative 40
regional distribution of shares at year-end 2003, which was the date then expected for the completion of the share allocations resulting from the integration. The model projected issuing volumes (GDV) and acquiring volumes (GAV) by region, which were categorized by type for proxy purposes. European member volumes and revenues were projected by Europay for the same periods. The revenue figures that were shared with CSFB for use in connection with its fairness opinion were not materially different from the revenue figures used in the proxy analysis. Together, these projections formed the basis for the case allocating an approximate 33.1% share of MasterCard Incorporated common stock to European member-stockholders at the conclusion of the transition period. MasterCard further reviewed these projections and made adjustments to reflect lower projected revenue and lower conversion rates of ec Pictogram cards to Maestro only cards during the transition period. MasterCard management used these assumptions to generate a more conservative case. These adjusted projections formed the basis for the case allocating an approximate 25.7% share of MasterCard Incorporated common stock to European member-stockholders at the conclusion of the transition period. MasterCard management also prepared an upside case to measure the revenue and the converted ec Pictogram volumes that would be required for European member-stockholders to own a 44% share of MasterCard Incorporated common stock at the conclusion of the transition period. To support that case, European member-stockholders would have to convert all ec Pictogram cards to Maestro and would have to pay fees on the resulting volumes generated by the end of the three-year transition period. Based on the projections of GDV, GAV, and revenues described above and deemed to be reasonable by MasterCard International and Europay, the parties concluded that it would be appropriate to allocate 33 1/3% of the total outstanding shares to European members at the closing. Similarly, based on projections of the likely best and worst case for European GDV, GAV and revenue performance during the transition period, the parties concluded that it would be appropriate to establish a minimum aggregate European shareholding percentage of 26% and a maximum aggregate European shareholding percentage of 44%, in each case at the conclusion of the transition period. The European members could lose some of the shares initially allocated at closing if, at the end of the transition period, their contribution did not fulfill expectations, which would most likely be attributable to lower volume conversion than anticipated. Alternatively, if the contribution as of the end of the transition period exceeded current expectations, they could receive additional shares, subject to the maximum ownership percentage of 44%. The Europay negotiating team was also concerned about the position of the European members as minority stockholders in a combined organization. MasterCard understood these concerns, but felt it was important to strike a balance with the general proposition that the will of the majority should prevail in corporate governance matters. The parties agreed that any supermajority voting requirements should be limited to matters relating to the fundamental organizational and ownership structure of the combined company. At a meeting of the MasterCard International board held in November 2000, members of the MasterCard International negotiating team and representatives from Mercer reported that the two sides had made substantial progress. The Mercer representatives made a presentation to the board concerning the latest draft of the term sheet. The board engaged in a discussion about particular aspects of the proposed terms. The board authorized the negotiating team to proceed with the negotiations and to engage in a formal due diligence investigation of Europay. Europay would undertake a similar investigation of MasterCard International. The parties began their respective due diligence investigations in December 2000. The parties' due diligence covered financial, accounting, operations, legal, human resources and other areas. Diligence was performed both on-site, at the other party's principal offices, and off-site. The diligence process continued for approximately two months. The MasterCard International and Europay negotiating teams met on December 6, 2000 and December 20, 2000, where they again discussed those matters in MasterCard Incorporated's organizational documents that should be subject to supermajority stockholder approval. These discussions continued at teleconference meetings on January 5 and January 11, 2001. On January 16, 2001, January 18, 2001 and January 22, 2001, the negotiating committees held additional teleconference meetings in order to finalize the term sheet that would be presented to the companies' respective boards of directors. 41
The February 8, 2001 Board Meeting. A special meeting of the MasterCard International board was held on February 8, 2001 for the purpose of considering and approving the term sheet. At this meeting, the board adopted resolutions recommending the conversion and integration to MasterCard International's members and approving the term sheet, and authorized the MasterCard International negotiating team to seek to finalize negotiations with Europay. The board also authorized the conversion of MasterCard International to a stock corporation. The board considered the following matters at the February 8, 2001 meeting: - Representatives of Mercer made a presentation about the changes made to the term sheet since the November board meeting. - John De Lavis, the MasterCard executive in charge of the MasterCard International due diligence team, presented the findings of the diligence investigation. - Jerry McElhatton, MasterCard International's senior executive in charge of technology, made a presentation regarding plans for integrating the technology systems of the two companies. - Representatives of CSFB presented their relative allocation analysis to the MasterCard board and delivered their signed fairness opinion to MasterCard. CSFB's presentation and analyses, together with the CSFB fairness opinion, are described under the heading "Opinion of Financial Advisor to MasterCard International." In addition, Denise K. Fletcher, MasterCard International's Chief Financial Officer, made a presentation at the February 8, 2001 board meeting regarding the valuation, tax and accounting aspects of the integration and conversion. This presentation also reviewed the text of certain prepared materials distributed to the board relating to valuation in advance of the meeting. Mrs. Fletcher reported on the valuation analysis by stating that management had developed three scenarios representing the possible ownership of the combined entity by European member-stockholders. She stated that the three scenarios were: (i) a 26% ownership case that represents the minimum guaranteed amount to the European member-stockholders; (ii) a 33 1/3% ownership case based on projections provided by Europay management; and (iii) a 44% ownership case that represents the maximum amount that European member-stockholders could own of MasterCard Incorporated regardless of performance. Mrs. Fletcher reported that, with respect to the 26% case, MasterCard had been valued at approximately $1.6 billion and Europay at approximately $390 million using a 10.5% discount rate and after applying a 50% reduction for both companies due to their private ownership structure. Mrs. Fletcher also reported that MasterCard's and Europay's management estimated that approximately $120 million in business synergies would result from integration on an after-tax, net present value basis, using a 10.5% discount rate and after applying the 50% private company discount. She reported that, in the 26% case, the total value of the combined company after the integration and including the synergies was estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion, using a 10.5% after-tax discount rate and after giving effect to the 50% private company discount. She stated that MasterCard management, in valuing Europay, assigned 85% of the synergy savings to Europay because approximately this portion (81%) of the synergies were expected to be derived from European operations. She stated that under the 26% case the sum of the synergies and the discounted cash flow value of the portion of Europay not presently owned by MasterCard was estimated at approximately $430 million. She then said that MasterCard management estimated that MasterCard would generate an after-tax return on investment of 14.8%, 14.4% and 14% for the 26%, 33 1/3% and the 44% cases, respectively, and that these returns were higher than the 10.5% cost of capital estimated for MasterCard. Mrs. Fletcher then noted that the valuation analysis supported European members owning 26% of MasterCard Incorporated after the conversion and integration. She further noted that the initial allocation of 33 1/3% was supported by the model reported by MasterCard management (with projections regarding the Europe region coming from Europay management) referred to above. According to the deal ultimately negotiated between the parties, European member-stockholders would initially be allocated 33 1/3% of the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated with a reallocation at the end of the three-year transition period that adjusts European member-stockholder ownership to a level between 26% and 44%, depending on actual performance of the Europe region. 42
The information presented to the MasterCard International board on February 8, 2001 by CSFB and Mrs. Fletcher was supported by projections provided to CSFB by MasterCard management that reflected management's best estimates for 2000 earnings and the 2001 budget. The projections also related to revenue and operating income for the periods 2000 through 2004. The revenue projections reflected the assumption that the economy could not continue to grow as it had in the late 1990s and that revenue growth would slow as the global economy decelerated. However, margins were expected to expand gradually reflecting productivity gains, especially in transaction processing. Europay management also provided revenue, operating expense and operating income projections regarding the Europe region to CSFB. These projections, along with MasterCard management's projections for MasterCard International, formed the basis for the case for allocating 33 1/3% of the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated to European member-stockholders at the conclusion of the three-year transition period. MasterCard management reviewed Europay's projections and provided CSFB with adjusted projections, which reflected reduced revenue and operating income estimates. This more conservative case formed the basis for the case for allocating 26% of the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated to European member-stockholders at the conclusion of the transition period. MasterCard management also developed projections that would form the basis for an upside case, which would allocate 44% of the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated to European member-stockholders at the conclusion of the transition period. MasterCard and Europay management also worked together to develop a synergy plan which projected 81% of the savings being derived from European operations, predominantly from staff savings and system integration synergies. In the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with its delivery of the fairness opinion dated January 16, 2002, MasterCard management provided CSFB with updated projections for the periods from 2001 through 2004, and added 2005. The updated projections reflected the following adjustments: - the most recent 2001 forecast was employed; - the most recent 2002 budget projections for Europay and MasterCard, reflecting the impact of the slowdown in the economy in general and the particular consequences of the events of September 11, 2001 were employed; - an assumption was made that, by the beginning of 2003, MasterCard and Europay would function at the same level that they would have functioned had the events of September 11, 2001 not occurred; - MasterCard management's projected 2005 Europay revenues, operating expenses, pre-tax income and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) were provided; and - MasterCard management's projected 2005 revenues, operating expenses, pre-tax income and EBITDA for MasterCard International were provided. MasterCard management also updated the synergy analysis based on the integration planning and implementation that had taken place since CSFB's fairness opinion of January 30, 2001. The Europay Board Meeting; Implementation Efforts. On February 12, 2001, the board of directors of Europay approved resolutions recommending the integration to Europay's shareholders. During the months of February through May 2001, counsel for MasterCard International and Europay prepared definitive documentation to effect the conversion and integration. Numerous telephone conversations and meetings were held among representatives of MasterCard International and Europay and their legal advisors for the purpose of negotiating the definitive agreements. Forms of agreements were provided to the MasterCard International and MasterCard Incorporated boards in advance of a special meeting called for May 16, 2001. At this meeting, the MasterCard International and MasterCard Incorporated boards approved the forms of agreements and authorized management to file the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Subsequently, the managements of MasterCard and Europay finalized the definitive agreements and prepared the registration statement for filing. 43
Statement Regarding Projections. The preceding discussion under the heading "The Integration -- Background of the Integration" contains certain projections and forward-looking statements. MasterCard and Europay do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results. The projections set forth above were not prepared with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding projections. Neither MasterCard's nor Europay's independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to these projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or other form of assurance with respect to these projections or their achieveability, and assume no responsibility for them. The inclusion of these projections in this document should not be regarded as a representation by MasterCard or Europay or any of their advisors, agents or representatives that these projections are or will prove to be correct. Projections of this type are based on a number of significant uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and most of which are beyond MasterCard's and Europay's control. As a result, there can be no assurance that any of these projections will be realized. The projections are or involve forward-looking statements, assume that the conversion and integration have occurred and are based upon a variety of assumptions, including MasterCard's and Europay's ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives, and targets over the applicable period. These assumptions involve judgments with respect to future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, financial market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond MasterCard's and Europay's control. Many important factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus, could cause MasterCard's and Europay's results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projections are indicative of MasterCard's or Europay's future performance or that actual results will not differ materially from those in the projections set forth above. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements." CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION In approving the integration, our board of directors considered a number of advantages associated with the acquisition of Europay by MasterCard Incorporated. The integration represents the opportunity for MasterCard to enhance its global scope and payment programs by acquiring an important company that operates in a desirable region of the world and has demonstrated success in several key business functions. Specifically: - In 2001, the Europe region represented approximately 20% of MasterCard's worldwide gross dollar volume, not including Maestro and Cirrus transactions. - European countries are among the largest and most sophisticated payments markets in the world and represent a significant portion of the global payments industry. - Europay has demonstrated expertise in chip and debit programs and services, and in the ongoing development of new mobile commerce payment applications. The integration will also give MasterCard the opportunity to: - Establish a more consistent global marketing message, particularly in Europe, that is intended to increase MasterCard's presence in Europe and thereby make the Europe region more attractive to all MasterCard members. Following completion of the integration, MasterCard will be better able to coordinate European marketing programs, enabling us to build our brands in Europe in concert with our global brand-building efforts. We expect that this increased coordination, combined with improved productivity, faster time to market and greater emphasis on customized solutions for members, should strengthen the presence of the MasterCard family of brands both in Europe and around the world. - Take advantage of Europay's expertise in debit and chip cards and mobile commerce. Europay and Maestro have established in Europe a significant leadership in the debit and chip card arenas as well as in mobile commerce. Given the increasing use by cardholders globally of these applications, the skills 44
and knowledge already present at Europay in these areas will represent a key strength for MasterCard, permitting the development of new business solutions. The integration represents the opportunity for Europay to merge with a well-capitalized industry leader and, as a result, to leverage its own strengths based on the broader resources of the MasterCard brand and organization. For European members of the combined company, integration with MasterCard provides additional opportunities to succeed in an increasingly competitive global business, in which size, an existing network of members, and the ability to develop quickly new and profitable products and services will likely differentiate successful competitors. In particular, the integration with MasterCard provides European members with the opportunity to: - Participate in the MasterCard system on a much more significant scale than they currently do. After the conversion and integration, the European members will participate in MasterCard Incorporated as holders initially of 33 1/3% of its outstanding common stock, subject to change after the transition period, as more fully described in "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." - Utilize MasterCard's expertise in brand building and customer-centered service. Following completion of the integration, MasterCard's marketing team will coordinate with members and staff in the new Europe region to enhance brand-building efforts in that region. This is expected to result in increased brand awareness and higher usage and acceptance levels, making the European region stronger for all MasterCard members. Furthermore, European members will benefit from the reallocation of MasterCard's resources to deliver more customized relationship management and professional services. - Utilize MasterCard's expertise in marketing consulting, Internet and corporate expertise. The integration will permit Europay to take advantage of MasterCard's marketing consulting expertise to further advance the European credit business. In addition, joining MasterCard's Internet experience with Europay's strengths in chip and mobile commerce should lead to the development of more electronic business solutions. Finally, Europay will be able to draw on the corporate resources of the larger MasterCard organization. To both MasterCard and Europay, the integration represents the opportunity to merge separate businesses into one organization, with the resulting opportunity to develop a stronger, combined operation and to: - Establish a global management team and governance structure. The integration of the companies will provide an opportunity for a more cohesive and consistent global governance and management structure, which is currently divided among the MasterCard, Europay and Maestro organizations, each of which has separate governance requirements. Integrating MasterCard and Europay is also expected to result in a more rapid time to market for products due to enhanced decision-making and coordinated product development and management. - Establish improved delivery of customized relationship management and professional services. As a result of the integration, we hope that the combined company will be in a position to deliver to European members more customized relationship management and professional services, such as marketing and operations consulting, to foster the growth and profitability of existing businesses and to facilitate the establishment of new payments programs and applications. In addition, we expect to join the technology operations of MasterCard and Europay to improve the flexibility, speed of change, interoperability and productivity of services provided to members, as well as to reduce costs. Finally, standardizing MasterCard's and Europay's programs and services should improve and make more consistent the quality of services delivered to members. - Achieve personnel and system synergies. By combining the two companies, a greater pool of key personnel resources should be available to maintain and enhance our competitive advantages, including a wider array of customer, product and regional knowledge; technologies; marketing support and research; and stronger financial resources. In addition, we expect that, by integrating the two companies, we will be able to realize cost savings from integrating our transaction processing systems, eliminating overlapping staff functions and programs and by taking advantages of economies of scale. 45
In approving the integration, our board of directors and the Europay board of directors also considered the disadvantages of integration. The integration may: - Create expected synergies that never materialize. We may be unable to reduce costs, merge effectively our management structures or improve programs and professional services to our members in a timely or efficient manner. It may also prove difficult to streamline our technology or other operations, increase the customization and management of our member relationships and standardize our combined programs and services. Finally, we may not successfully combine personnel or systems resources or achieve economies of scale. - Cause significant dilution in the ownership of non-European members of MasterCard International. The integration will cause the ownership of the non-European members of MasterCard International in MasterCard Incorporated to be significantly diluted as compared to those members' current percentage of the total equity rights in MasterCard International. - Adversely impact some members through the introduction of the new global proxy formula. Because the new global proxy formula considers additional factors (including GDV, GAV and revenues and volumes associated with Maestro and Cirrus cards) in allocating equity rights, it will dilute the ownership percentage of member-stockholders who are comparatively underweighted in such factors. No director or officer or any of their affiliates has a substantial interest, direct or indirect, in the integration. THE INTEGRATION AGREEMENT We summarize below the material terms and other provisions of the integration agreement. The description is not complete, and we refer you to the integration agreement, which is contained in Annex B of this proxy statement-prospectus and which we have filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus is a part. EXCHANGE AND ALLOCATION OF SHARES The acquisition of Europay will be made pursuant to the Share Exchange and Integration Agreement entered into by MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International and Europay International, which we refer to as the integration agreement. In connection with the integration agreement, each shareholder of Europay (other than MasterCard International and MEPUK) has been required to enter into a separate share exchange agreement with MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International, pursuant to which it will exchange its Europay shares for a specified number of shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, the shareholders of MEPUK have been required to enter into the MEPUK agreement with MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International as described under the heading "-- MEPUK" below, pursuant to which they will exchange their MEPUK shares for a specified number of shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. The integration agreement also provides, as an integral component of the conversion and integration, that the shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated issued to the principal members of MasterCard International and the shareholders of Europay and MEPUK will initially be reallocated within each of the European and non-European member- stockholder groups in accordance with the new global proxy calculation described herein. The integration agreement defines how the European members of MasterCard, including those members that are not shareholders of Europay, and the non-European members of MasterCard, will be treated in the conversion and the integration. For a description of the allocation of shares resulting from the conversion and integration, see "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PRIOR TO CLOSING OF INTEGRATION From the date of the integration agreement until the closing of the integration, each of MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International and Europay have agreed to conduct their respective businesses in the 46
ordinary course, consistent with past practice, and, among other things, to take all commercially reasonable steps and to act in good faith in cooperation with the other party to obtain all necessary government approvals. The parties also have agreed to the restrictions summarized below. Europay has agreed that, except as may be required by law, unless previously disclosed to MasterCard International or agreed to by MasterCard Incorporated, it and its subsidiaries will not, and will not enter into an agreement to, among other things: - increase the compensation of its officers, employees or consultants whose compensation is, or after giving effect to any change, would be, $100,000 or more; - issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or its other equity interests; - declare or pay any dividend or other distribution on its capital stock or its other equity interests or redeem or purchase any of its capital stock or its other equity interests; - incur net new debt exceeding E15 million or prepaying any existing debt; - make capital expenditures or commitments exceeding E15 million. MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International have agreed that they and their subsidiaries will not: - liquidate or dissolve themselves; - declare or pay any dividend or other distribution on its capital stock or other equity interests or redeem or purchase any capital stock or other equity interests; or - engage in a material business combination transaction unless it has been disclosed in this proxy statement-prospectus. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING OF THE INTEGRATION MasterCard Incorporated's and MasterCard International's obligations, on the one hand, and Europay's obligations, on the other hand, to complete the integration are subject to satisfaction, or waiver by the other side, of the following conditions: - each party's representations and warranties must be true on the date of the closing of the integration; - each party must have performed or complied with each of its respective agreements contained in the integration agreement; - there must not be, on the date of closing of the integration, any order or law prohibiting the closing of the integration or conversion or any action or proceeding to prohibit the integration before any governmental and regulatory authority, and all required consents and approvals with any governmental or regulatory authorities, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party, must have been obtained; - all consents or waivers to the performance by the parties to the integration agreement of their respective obligations under the integration agreement and all consents or waivers relating to contracts of the parties must be obtained in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party; - the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part must have been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission and must not be subject to any stop order or proceeding by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a stop order; and - each party must have had delivered to the other opinions of counsel, officer's certificates, revised charter and bylaws and tax rulings from relevant tax authorities or related opinions of tax counsel, in each case, as specified in the integration agreement. 47
In addition, MasterCard Incorporated's and MasterCard International's obligations to complete the integration are subject to the satisfaction by Europay, or the waiver by MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International, of the following additional conditions: - the board of directors of Europay must have resigned, effective as of the date of the closing of the integration; - certain of the European members must have entered into an intellectual property assignment agreement, as specified in the integration agreement, confirming that Europay is the sole owner of the intellectual property rights associated with its brands; - each shareholder of Europay (other than MEPUK) must have entered into a share exchange agreement with MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International, as specified in the integration agreement, to transfer its shares of Europay capital stock to MasterCard Incorporated in exchange for class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated, as summarized above, and the MEPUK agreement described under the caption "-- MEPUK" below must have been entered into; - all Europay and MEPUK shareholders receiving shares in the integration must be principal members of MasterCard International prior to the closing of the integration; and - a satisfactory U.S. tax opinion from counsel or Internal Revenue Service ruling must have been received by MasterCard Incorporated. Finally, Europay's obligation to complete the integration is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions: - the merger agreement must have been executed; and - satisfactory tax opinions or rulings from applicable taxing authorities with respect to the tax consequences of the conversion and integration in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions must have been received. Any of the closing conditions to the integration, as described above, may be waived by the parties to the integration agreement. Since the completion of the integration is a condition to the conversion, if a material condition to the integration is waived, MasterCard International will resolicit approval for the conversion from its principal members. The form of the share exchange agreement referred to above is an exhibit to the integration agreement, which is contained in Annex B to this proxy statement-prospectus. We have also separately filed the form of share exchange agreement as Annex C to this proxy statement-prospectus. POST-CLOSING COVENANTS After the closing of the integration, the parties to the integration agreement agree that: - MasterCard Incorporated will initiate and maintain a Global Center of Excellence in Waterloo, Belgium as the primary focus of global debit activities for three years, so long as it is commercially reasonable to do so; - MasterCard Incorporated will initiate a Global Center of Excellence for mobile commerce and chip products in Waterloo, Belgium for three years, so long as it is commercially reasonable to do so; - MasterCard will not prohibit the use of Eurocard as a program name so long as it is used in a manner consistent with any rules of MasterCard concerning the use of program names; - subject to the approval of the appropriate internal divisions, the parties intend that members will not experience any adverse impact on pricing or service levels as a result of a technical convergence; and - marketing support to the Eurocard brand in connection with its sponsorship of European football will continue until the European Football Championships in 2004. 48
TERMINATION The parties to the integration agreement may terminate it on any of the following bases: - by mutual agreement of the parties for any reason; - in the event of a material breach by Europay, on the one hand, or MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International, on the other hand, that is not cured within five business days following notice of the breach or on notice by one party that the satisfaction of its obligations under the integration agreement has become impossible or impracticable despite the use of commercially reasonable efforts; and - at any time after June 30, 2002 if the closing of the integration has not occurred and this failure is not a result of a breach of the integration agreement by the terminating party. ALLOCATION OF LIABILITY FOR BREACH The bylaws of MasterCard International provide that losses and liabilities resulting from a breach of the representations and warranties of MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International or Europay contained in the integration agreement will be distributed equitably among MasterCard's six regions as an expense. However, losses and liabilities related to a breach by either of MasterCard Incorporated or MasterCard International of its representations and warranties in the integration agreement exceeding $21 million in the aggregate will be allocated solely to regions other than Europe. Conversely, losses and liabilities related to a breach by Europay of its representations and warranties in the integration agreement exceeding $7 million in the aggregate will be allocated solely to Europe. SUPERMAJORITY VOTING PROVISIONS After completion of the conversion and integration, approval of at least 75% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present and, in certain cases, the holders of a majority of the outstanding class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock voting together as a single class (so long as the class B convertible common stock has voting rights) will be required to, among other things: - alter MasterCard Incorporated's status as a stock corporation; - amend the certificate of incorporation of MasterCard Incorporated to authorize MasterCard Incorporated to issue stock other than the class A redeemable, B convertible or C common stock; - sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of MasterCard Incorporated's assets; - approve the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of MasterCard International; - engage in a business combination (merger or consolidation) involving MasterCard Incorporated or MasterCard International; - undertake an initial public offering; - amend the MasterCard International certificate of incorporation to allow MasterCard International to issue capital stock, to create additional classes of membership interests in MasterCard International, to subject the property of the members of MasterCard International to the obligations of MasterCard International or to subject non-U.S. programs to the satisfaction of any liabilities arising from the current DOJ and merchant antitrust litigations in the United States; - amend the provisions of the MasterCard International bylaws relating to special assessments that may be imposed upon the members of MasterCard International; - make any modification to the bylaw provision stating the proportion of directors to come from each region; - alter MasterCard International's board seating methodology; 49
- change the definition of the global proxy calculation; - raise the limitation on voting for directors applicable to stockholders and their affiliates to greater than 15% of the outstanding voting stock entitled to be voted; - approve the issuance of voting class C common stock or class C common stock that, together with all other issuances of class C common stock made during the immediately preceding two years, represents greater than 5% of the total number of shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock outstanding prior to the issuance; and - modify any of these supermajority requirements. After completion of the conversion and integration, the following actions, among others, will require approval of at least 66 2/3% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present: - establishing or eliminating regional boards; - modifying MasterCard's internal regional cost allocation methodology; - modifying the bylaw provision setting forth the overall size of the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors; - approving the issuance of shares of class C common stock; - permitting a stockholder's ownership level to exceed 15%; - permitting the issuance of shares of class A redeemable or class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated in excess of the number of shares to which a stockholder would be entitled under the global proxy; - deciding to overrule a decision taken by a regional board that was permitted to be taken in accordance with the bylaws; - deciding to overrule a recommendation made by the Debit Advisory Board that was permitted to be taken in accordance with the bylaws; and - modifying any of these supermajority requirements. More detailed supermajority voting provisions are contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of each of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International. See "Description of Capital Stock of MasterCard Incorporated" and "Comparison of Rights of MasterCard International Members Before and After the Conversion and Integration." MEPUK One of the shareholders of Europay is MasterCard/Europay U.K. Limited ("MEPUK"), a company formed by certain financial institutions in the United Kingdom for the purpose of holding their shares in Europay. MEPUK also manages rules applicable to the domestic settlement of MasterCard-branded transactions by financial institutions in the United Kingdom. In lieu of the share exchange procedures described elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus, the shareholders of MEPUK have been required to enter into a related share exchange agreement with MasterCard Incorporated pursuant to which they will exchange all their MEPUK shares for shares of common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. As a result of this transaction, MEPUK will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated and will continue to hold shares of Europay. Currently, each shareholder of MEPUK is a shareholder in Europay through its ownership in MEPUK. In addition, at the time of the closing of the conversion and integration, all of the shareholders of MEPUK will be principal members of MasterCard International. On or before the closing of the integration, MEPUK will distribute to its shareholders or otherwise cause to be discharged any and all assets and liabilities of MEPUK, other than its shares in Europay. In addition, the 50
existing MEPUK shareholders will transfer MEPUK's responsibilities for the U.K. domestic rules and other operations to a new entity that is not affiliated with MasterCard Incorporated. Accordingly, at the time of the closing of the conversion and integration, MEPUK will have no operations and its sole purpose will be to hold Europay shares. In the MEPUK agreement, the MEPUK shareholders have agreed to indemnify MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International for any liability of MEPUK that relates to the period up to and including the closing of the integration. MasterCard Incorporated has also agreed to distribute to the MEPUK shareholders, net of any taxes or liabilities, any assets of MEPUK (other than the Europay shares) not distributed prior to the closing of the integration. The MEPUK agreement is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part. BRAND MIGRATION MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International and/or Europay intend to enter into one or more brand migration agreements with principal members in Europe, including EKS in Germany, pursuant to which, among other things, MasterCard and Europay will provide support for marketing initiatives designed to migrate all uses of the Eurocard-MasterCard brand mark on cards, acceptance decals, advertising and other materials to the MasterCard brand mark. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE INTEGRATION We anticipate that the integration will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the integration that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized, but will be tested for impairment at least annually. In the Europay share exchange, stockholders of Europay and MEPUK, other than MasterCard International, will exchange their shares of Europay and MEPUK for 23.76 million shares of MasterCard Incorporated. The transaction provides that the number of shares allocated to former shareholders of Europay and MEPUK will increase or decrease at the end of the transition period as a result of the application of the global proxy formula for the third year of the transition period. See "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." In accounting for the initial purchase price of Europay, MasterCard will not consider shares above the minimum number of shares allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders at the end of the transition period because only the minimum number of shares is issued unconditionally at the closing to such shareholders. Of the 23.76 million shares attributable to the exchange of Europay and MEPUK shares, 6.15 million shares are conditional shares subject to reallocation at the end of the transition period and allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders. Europay and MEPUK shareholders are therefore receiving 17.61 million unconditional shares at closing. The value of each MasterCard Incorporated share, immediately before the exchange, is estimated to be $15.21 based on an independent appraisal. Accordingly, MasterCard's purchase price for the shares of Europay is estimated to be $267.9 million. Since former Europay and MEPUK shareholders would retain or receive shares of MasterCard Incorporated at the end of the transition period without remitting any additional consideration, any shares retained or received by them that are above their minimum allocation at that time would constitute part of the purchase price. Any such additional shares would be valued at that time based upon the fair value of the stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of shares to former Europay and MEPUK shareholders will increase the purchase price for Europay and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill and additional paid-in-capital recorded. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not give effect to any potential contingent consideration. With respect to the manner in which they account for their equity interest in MasterCard, members should consult their financial advisors regarding the potential accounting implications of the integration. 51
REGULATORY MATTERS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION Within the European Union, transactions falling under the European Commission's merger regulations require prior notification and regulatory approval. The proposed integration amounts to a concentration within the meaning of the European Commission merger regulations because it will entail a change of control of Europay. However, because the consolidated worldwide revenue of MasterCard and Europay is below the threshold stipulated by the regulations, prior notification and regulatory approval will not be required at the European Commission level. Notwithstanding this, Europay has informed the European Commission of the integration for informational purposes. A number of countries within the European Union require notification and prior regulatory approval depending upon whether the national merger control thresholds are met or not. National merger control thresholds can relate to the national and worldwide revenues of the parties and/or to their market share in the country in question, with thresholds for market share ranging from 20% to 35%. National notification was necessary in Germany and Finland on the basis of revenue and in Spain and Greece on the basis of national market share. As of the date of this proxy statement-prospectus, the transaction has been cleared by the national competition authorities in each of these countries. Certain members of MasterCard International and certain shareholders of Europay that receive shares of MasterCard Incorporated in the transactions may be required to make filings under the HSR Act if the fair market value of their MasterCard Incorporated shares exceeds $50 million and they do not intend to hold those shares solely for investment purposes. Members should consult their advisors to determine whether they are required to make any filings under the HSR Act. The completion of both the conversion and the integration would be subject to the expiration or termination of all waiting periods for which filings will be made with the U.S. antitrust agencies under the HSR Act, in connection with both transactions. 52
SHARE ALLOCATION AND THE GLOBAL PROXY INTRODUCTION Since the mid 1990s, the global proxy formula used by MasterCard International to allocate equity rights at annual meetings of members has been based solely on revenue received by MasterCard International on MasterCard transactions. In connection with the conversion and integration, MasterCard Incorporated will migrate to a new global proxy formula designed to take a more comprehensive, balanced account of the contributions of member-stockholders to MasterCard's business. In particular, the new global proxy calculation will measure each member-stockholder's contribution to three key elements of MasterCard's business -- gross dollar volume ("GDV"), gross acquiring volume ("GAV") and revenue -- and will also account for revenue and volume earned principally in connection with MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards. Revenue will account for one half, and GDV and GAV will each account for one fourth, of the new global proxy calculation. The new global proxy calculation will be used for three purposes. First, in conjunction with the apportionment of MasterCard Incorporated shares between members within Europe and members outside of Europe described below, it will be used to determine the initial allocation of shares to member-stockholders upon the closing of the conversion and integration. Second, the new global proxy calculation will be used to determine the reallocation of MasterCard Incorporated shares among member-stockholders at the end of the three-year transition period following the closing of the conversion and integration, also in conjunction with the apportionment of shares between Europe and non-Europe described below. Finally, it will be used on an ongoing basis to determine the maximum number of shares of MasterCard Incorporated that a member-stockholder may own and the minimum number of shares of MasterCard Incorporated that a member-stockholder will be required to own. MasterCard Incorporated's calculation of the global proxy for each member-stockholder will be considered final and binding unless the board of directors determines that an error was made in the computation, in which case the computation will be corrected in accordance with directions of the board. In connection with the initial allocation of shares, the relevant period for calculating the new global proxy will be the 12 month period ended December 31, 2000. (In contrast, the last global proxy using the historical, revenue-only formula was calculated for the 12 month period ended September 30, 2001.) All subsequent calculations of the new global proxy will be made on the basis of each successive 12 month period beginning on the first business day of the fiscal quarter following the closing of the conversion and integration. All global proxy calculations will be made on an accrual basis of accounting. (In contrast, the historical global proxy formula was calculated on a cash basis of accounting). The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated is empowered to establish a record date in connection with each global proxy calculation for purposes of determining the stockholders of record whose GDV, GAV and revenue will be included in determining the relevant global proxy. The new global proxy formula and the regional apportionment of shares are described in the integration agreement and in the by-laws of MasterCard Incorporated. Matters relating to the ec Pictogram shares are described principally in the integration agreement. THE NEW GLOBAL PROXY FORMULA WILL ONLY TAKE ACCOUNT OF REVENUES AND VOLUMES CONTRIBUTED BY PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INCLUDING AFFILIATE MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATE INDIRECTLY IN THE MASTERCARD BUSINESS THROUGH PRINCIPAL MEMBERS, CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL GLOBAL PROXY CALCULATION. AFFILIATE MEMBERS WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY SHARES IN THE CONVERSION AND INTEGRATION, BUT PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL WILL RECEIVE SHARES BASED ON THE NEW GLOBAL PROXY FORMULA THAT REFLECTS REVENUES AND VOLUMES CONTRIBUTED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF MAESTRO INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED OR CIRRUS SYSTEMS, INC. BUT ARE NOT ALSO PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OR AFFILIATES OF PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY SHARES IN THE CONVERSION AND INTEGRATION BUT WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SHARES AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD IF THEY APPLY FOR, AND ARE GRANTED, PRINCIPAL MEMBERSHIP IN MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD AND ARE ALLOCATED SHARES OF MASTERCARD 58
INCORPORATED DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED AT THE END OF THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. ON THE CLOSING DATE OF THE CONVERSION AND INTEGRATION, EACH PRINCIPAL MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED INTO A CLASS A MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL AND SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF MASTERCARD INCORPORATED. HOWEVER, TO RECEIVE SHARES AT CLOSING, A MEMBER MUST, IN ADDITION TO QUALIFYING AS A PRINCIPAL MEMBER ON THE CLOSING DATE, HAVE CONTRIBUTED REVENUES AND/OR VOLUMES TO MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL AS A PRINCIPAL MEMBER DURING THE 12 MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE NEW GLOBAL PROXY FORMULA DESCRIBED HEREIN. IF NO SUCH REVENUES OR VOLUMES WERE CONTRIBUTED, A PRINCIPAL MEMBER WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSION BUT WILL NOT RECEIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF MASTERCARD INCORPORATED AT THE CLOSING. THE MASTERCARD INCORPORATED BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXPECTS TO ADOPT PROCEDURES TO ISSUE SHARES OF MASTERCARD INCORPORATED COMMON STOCK TO PRINCIPAL MEMBERS DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD THAT DID NOT QUALIFY TO RECEIVE SHARES AT CLOSING, IN ORDER TO PERMIT SUCH MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REALLOCATION OF MASTERCARD INCORPORATED SHARES THAT WILL OCCUR AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD. THE GLOBAL PROXY The Formula. For each member-stockholder, the global proxy calculation will be equal to the sum obtained by adding (A) .25 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the member-stockholder's GDV and the denominator of which is MasterCard Incorporated's total GDV attributable to all member- stockholders, plus (B) .25 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the member-stockholder's GAV and the denominator of which is MasterCard Incorporated's total GAV attributable to all member-stockholders, plus (C) .50 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (1) all non-travelers cheque revenues paid by the member-stockholder to MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries and (2) two times the travelers cheque revenues paid by the member-stockholder to MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries, and the denominator of which is the sum of (1) all non-travelers cheque revenues paid by all member-stockholders to MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries and (2) two times the travelers cheque revenues paid by all member-stockholders to MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries, in each case for the applicable period. Travelers cheque programs shall be deemed to have no GDV or GAV for purposes of the global proxy calculation. Only actual, as opposed to estimated, GDV, GAV and revenues paid will be considered for purposes of the global proxy calculation. In addition, for purposes of the global proxy calculation: - GDV. GDV means processed and non-processed issued volumes (including domestic and international retail purchases, cash transactions, convenience checks, on-us transactions, intra-processor transactions, local use only transactions and balance and commercial funds transfers) that occur as a result of one or more of (A) a transaction involving any one of MasterCard Incorporated's brands (e.g., MasterCard, Eurocard, Maestro, Cirrus and ec Pictogram) or (B) a non-MasterCard branded transaction involving a card that includes any one of MasterCard Incorporated's brand logos as well as other payment brand logos, provided that such other payment brands are not in direct competition with any MasterCard brands as determined by MasterCard Incorporated. - GAV. GAV means processed and non-processed acquired volumes (including domestic and international retail purchases, cash transactions, on-us transactions, intra-processor transactions and local use only transactions) that occur as a result of one or more of (A) a transaction involving any one of MasterCard Incorporated's brands (e.g., MasterCard, Eurocard, Maestro, Cirrus and ec Pictogram) or (B) a non-MasterCard branded transaction involving a card that includes any one of MasterCard Incorporated's brand logos as well as other payment brand logos, provided that such other payment brands are not in direct competition with any MasterCard brands as determined by MasterCard Incorporated. - Revenue. Revenues paid for a particular member-stockholder are, for any period, all revenues of MasterCard Incorporated on a consolidated basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that are generated by the activities of that member-stockholder, other than (1) any fees or other charges 59
associated with the termination of that member-stockholder's membership in MasterCard International, (2) integration-related assessments paid by that member-stockholder, (3) other assessments, fees and charges paid by that member-stockholder in its capacity as a member of MasterCard International if those assessments, fees and charges were imposed on less than all of the members of MasterCard International (except for assessments, fees and charges pertaining to business development, ordinary course of business and other matters deemed to be includable by the management of MasterCard International in management's sole discretion) and (4) fines and penalties paid by that member-stockholder (except as determined includable in the sole discretion of the management of MasterCard International). For purposes of the initial allocation of shares associated with the closing of the conversion and integration, MasterCard intends generally to include fines and penalties in the calculation of revenues paid, except for termination fees. - Card Fee Assessment. A card fee assessment means a bona fide, non de minimis fee expressed as a fixed amount in connection with a card. - Volume-based Assessment. A volume-based assessment means a bona fide, non de minimis assessment typically expressed as a percentage of the GDV or GAV associated with a particular type of transaction. GDV and GAV Volume Weightings. In calculating GDV and GAV, each member-stockholder's volume must be broken into four categories, each of which is weighted differently for purposes of the calculation, as described below. The weighted categories are designed to reflect the relative value of different activities to MasterCard's overall business, and provide the highest recognition to transactions that are fully assessed by MasterCard based on volume. Volumes attributable to transactions involving only card-based assessments are accorded relatively lower weight. Volumes are included in the global proxy calculation whether they are assessed directly or the cards to which they relate are subject to card fee assessments of the type contemplated by the applicable category of volume. In addition, for each global proxy calculation performed prior to the expiration of the transition period, volumes in the following categories will be included even if they are not subject to volume-based or card fee assessments. Finally, the volume weightings give significant credit to ec Pictogram-branded volumes (a regional debit brand owned by Europay) and other similar debit volumes, provided they have been converted to the Maestro brand or are the subject of binding written commitments to convert to Maestro. Ordinarily, the global proxy formula accounts only for volumes associated with MasterCard's principal brands -- MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus. As a result of negotiations with Europay, proxy weightings have been extended to ec Pictogram and similar regional debit volumes to give credit for the significant business currently done under those brands in Europe. The conversion commitment has also been implemented to encourage members to consistently migrate those volumes to MasterCard's principal brands in the future. The ec Pictogram brand will be owned by MasterCard Incorporated following the conversion and integration. - Volumes Weighted at 100%. All of the following volumes are weighted at 100% of actual volume: (1) volumes on cards that include a MasterCard brand logo and that are subject to volume-based assessments or card fee assessments, (2) Maestro and Cirrus processed debit volumes and (3) Maestro and Cirrus debit volumes that are subject to volume-based assessments, so long as Maestro, a brand representing a stored value application that is permitted to be used by members of MasterCard International and/or Cirrus is the sole acceptance brand on the card. - Volumes Weighted at 75%. The following volumes are weighted at 75% of actual volume: ec Pictogram volumes and other similar debit volumes that in each case have been converted to Maestro volumes so long as Maestro, a brand representing a stored value application that is permitted to be used by members of MasterCard International and/or Cirrus is the sole acceptance brand on the card and the card is subject to card fee assessments. - Sliding Scale of Weightings for Certain Regional Debit Volumes. Volumes for regional debit brands owned (or in the case of the initial allocation of shares to be owned) solely by MasterCard Incorporated on cards that include a Maestro and/or Cirrus logo are weighted at the following percentages for the period indicated; provided that such cards are subject to volume-based assessments 60
or card fee assessments; and provided, further, that for calculations for the last year of the transition period through the year ending on the second anniversary of the end of the transition period, there is a binding written commitment to remove all acceptance brand logos other than the Maestro brand logo, the Cirrus brand logo or the logo of a brand representing a stored value application that is permitted to be used by members of MasterCard International, on the cards not later than the fifth anniversary of the first fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter in which the closing of the conversion and integration occurs: - 10% of such volumes for all calculations until the last year of the transition period; - 40% of such volumes for the last year of the transition period; - 30% of such volumes for the year ending on the one-year anniversary of the end of the transition period; - 20% of such volumes for the year ending on the two-year anniversary of the end of the transition period; and - 10% of such volumes for subsequent years. - Volumes Weighted at 1%. Volumes for (i) regional debit brands not owned by MasterCard Incorporated on cards that include a Maestro and/or Cirrus brand logo and are subject to volume-based assessments or card fee assessments and (ii) balance and commercial funds transfers relating to cards that are subject to volume-based or card fee assessments are weighted at 1%. Currency Conversion. In performing the global proxy calculation, the conversion of euros to U.S. dollars, to the extent necessary, will be based on the average exchange rate during the twenty-day period ending on the day prior to the applicable measurement date, which we refer to as the average currency conversion rate, provided that during the transition period and for the two years thereafter the average currency conversion rate shall be $.9565 U.S. = 1 euro for so long as 1 euro is not less than $.9065 U.S. and not greater than $1.0065 U.S. In the event that the average currency conversion rate does not fall within this range, the rate to convert euros to U.S. dollars will be $.9565 U.S. = 1 euro adjusted by the difference between such average currency conversion rate and the upper or lower limit of the range, as applicable. For purposes of determining the global proxy calculation during the transition period and for the two years thereafter, amounts denominated in the currency of a country within the Europe region other than the euro will first be converted into euros and subsequently converted into U.S. dollars in accordance with the previous paragraph. Travelers Cheques. The revenue component of the global proxy formula provides that MasterCard International's travelers cheque members will calculate their respective global proxies using 100% of revenues paid by them to MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries in connection with their travelers cheque programs (in other words, revenues for travelers cheque members are doubled before being discounted by the 50% factor set forth in the global proxy formula). However, travelers cheque members will not receive credit for GDV or GAV in connection with their global proxy calculations, as the integration agreement provides that GDV and GAV will be deemed to be zero for travelers cheque programs. THE INITIAL ALLOCATION OF SHARES The allocation of shares of MasterCard Incorporated to each member-stockholder upon the closing of the conversion and integration will be determined in accordance with the detailed procedures described in the merger agreement, the integration agreement and the by-laws of MasterCard Incorporated. The new global proxy formula based on the 12 month period ended December 31, 2000, applied on a regional basis to Europe and non-Europe, will determine the number of shares that members receive initially in the conversion and integration. However, this outcome is the result of an integrated series of transaction steps in the conversion and integration, as described more fully below. 61
Shares Issued in the Conversion. In the conversion, each principal member of MasterCard International, including each MasterCard principal member in Europe, will receive a number of shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated that is proportional to the percentage of the total equity rights in MasterCard International that such member held in accordance with the historic proxy formula in effect for the period ended September 30, 2000. The historic global proxy calculation will be used to determine the shares allocated in the conversion step only and will have no further bearing on the outcome of the transaction. Shares Issued in the Integration. In the integration, each shareholder of Europay and MEPUK will receive a number of shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated in exchange for its shares of Europay or MEPUK, as the case may be, as specified in the share exchange agreement and MEPUK agreement, respectively. To the extent practicable, the shares issued in the integration step will be proportional to each shareholder's direct (in the case of Europay shareholders) or indirect (in the case of MEPUK shareholders) prior interest in Europay. Because all Europay and MEPUK shareholders will be principal members of MasterCard International at the closing of the conversion and integration, the issuance of additional shares in the integration will have the effect, when taken together with the shares issued in the conversion, of allocating 33 1/3% of the total shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock then outstanding to European members. Accordingly, the shares issued in the integration will have the result of diluting current non-European members' ownership from approximately 93% of MasterCard International before the conversion and integration to 66 2/3% of MasterCard Incorporated after the conversion and integration. Initial Reallocation of Shares Pursuant to the Global Proxy Calculation. At the closing of the conversion and integration, the shareholders of Europay and MEPUK will be principal members of MasterCard in Europe. Accordingly, the share issuances described above in connection with the conversion and integration will produce in the aggregate two pools of shares, one for European member-stockholders and the other for non-European member-stockholders. The integration agreement provides that the shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock will then initially be reallocated within each of the European and non-European pools of shares in accordance with the new global proxy formula. This reallocation will occur as an integral component of, and contemporaneously with, the closing of the conversion and integration. Accordingly, the new global proxy formula will determine the number of shares that members ultimately receive in the conversion and integration; the number of shares received by European members may vary across members compared to the number of Europay and/or MEPUK shares exchanged. Based on the new global proxy calculation, each member-stockholder in Europe will be entitled to a percentage of the European shares equivalent to the percentage that its aggregate GDV, GAV and revenue represents of the total GDV, GAV and revenue for Europe, using the methodology of the new global proxy. Similarly, outside of Europe, each member-stockholder will be entitled to a percentage of the non-European shares equivalent to the percentage that its aggregate GDV, GAV and revenue represents of the total GDV, GAV and revenue outside of Europe, using the methodology of the new global proxy. The accompanying proxy card sets forth the number of class A redeemable and class B convertible shares of MasterCard Incorporated common stock that you, as a current principal member of MasterCard International, will receive upon the closing of the conversion and integration (including in connection with the initial reallocation of shares described above). For principal members that are also shareholders of Europay or MEPUK, the number of shares reported on the proxy card includes all shares issued in connection with the acquisition of their Europay or MEPUK stock in the integration. Principal members should note that the number of shares set forth on the proxy card may be adjusted to reflect changes in the attribution of ICA numbers to principal members or the termination of principal members prior to the closing date of the conversion and integration. ICA numbers are the primary method used by MasterCard International to attribute revenues and volumes associated with card activity to members for proxy and other purposes. For example, if a principal member acquires ownership of an ICA number from another principal member prior to the closing date but after the date used to calculate share ownership information for the proxy card, the shares to be issued in respect of the revenues and volumes related to that principal ICA number will be distributed to 62
the purchasing member on the closing date, and the selling member will receive a corresponding fewer number of shares as compared to the information printed on its proxy card. Member-stockholders other than travelers cheque members can also estimate the aggregate number of class A redeemable and class B convertible shares of MasterCard Incorporated to be allocated to them at the closing of the conversion and integration using their own revenue and weighted GDV and GAV data and the following figures: For the 12 months ended December 31, 2000:
Aggregate Weighted European GDV (gross euro issuing volume): E304.0 billion Aggregate Weighted European GAV (gross euro acquiring volume): E303.6 billion Aggregate European Revenue: E355.2 million Aggregate Weighted non-European GDV: $548.9 billion Aggregate Weighted non-European GAV: $535.9 billion Aggregate non-European Revenue: $1,349.5 million
The formula to be applied with these figures is as follows:
(0.5)(Revenue paid by Member) (0.25)(Member Weighted GDV) (0.25)(Member Weighted GAV) + + ----------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- Aggregate Revenue Aggregate Weighted GDV Aggregate Weighted GAV
For purposes of this calculation, European members should use the aggregate European figures and non-European members should use the aggregate non-European figures. For ease of calculation, this formula does not account for travelers cheque revenues and, as such, produces an estimated result only. However, travelers cheque revenues do not have a material impact on the proxy calculation for principal and association members that are not also travelers cheque members. Travelers cheque members should consult the formula described under the caption "The Global Proxy -- The Formula" and set forth in the integration agreement to prepare an estimate of the aggregate number of shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated to be allocated to them. The foregoing formula produces a percentage that can be multiplied by the number of shares in the applicable pool of shares to derive an estimate of the number of shares to be received in the conversion and integration. A description of the total number of shares allocated to each pool is provided below. For all members, 84% of the shares received will be in the form of class A redeemable common stock and 16% of the shares received will be in the form of class B convertible common stock. In addition, as discussed above, the shares issued upon the closing of the conversion and integration will result in European member-stockholders receiving shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock that together represent 33 1/3% of all of the shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock together outstanding. The shares of class A redeemable common stock issued to the European member-stockholders will represent 28%, and the shares of class B convertible common stock issued to the European member-stockholders will represent 5 1/3%, of the respective total number of shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock together outstanding immediately after the closing of the conversion and integration. The remaining class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock, representing in the aggregate 66 2/3% of the class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock together outstanding, will be held by the non-European member-stockholders of MasterCard. The shares of class A redeemable common stock issued to the non-European member-stockholders will represent 56%, and the shares of class B convertible common stock issued to the non-European member-stockholders will represent 10 2/3%, of the total number of shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock together outstanding immediately after the closing of the conversion and integration. 63
Accordingly, immediately after the closing of the conversion and integration, shares of MasterCard Incorporated class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock will be allocated as follows: For the purposes of the global proxy calculation, European member-stockholders constitute those member-stockholders whose revenue and volume is generated from activity from and in Europe. Europe is defined to include the following countries: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Channel Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia (former Yugoslav Republic), Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, Vatican City and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). REALLOCATION OF SHARES AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD During the three year transition period after the closing of the conversion and integration, the member-stockholders will be entitled to the class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock that they held as of the closing of the transaction, regardless of changes in the respective global proxy calculations of those member-stockholders during the transition period, provided that they remain as principal members of MasterCard International and do not sell all or substantially all of their MasterCard card portfolios. Financial institutions that become principal members of MasterCard International after the period of the global proxy calculation used in connection with the initial allocation of shares will be eligible to be allocated shares at the end of the transition period in accordance with procedures to be determined by the board of directors. Until shares are allocated, those financial institutions will not be entitled to vote at any meetings of stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated. The reallocation of shares of MasterCard Incorporated at the conclusion of the three year transition period will be determined according to a multi-step process. First, the number of class B convertible shares that constitute ec Pictogram shares will be determined in accordance with the process described below. Second, the class B convertible shares (other than ec Pictogram shares) will be converted into class A redeemable shares on a one-for-one basis. Third, all class A redeemable shares will be reapportioned between Europe and non-Europe using the procedures described below. Fourth, each member-stockholder will be allocated class A redeemable shares according to the new global proxy, again calculated on both a European and non-European basis, as described in more detail below. As a result of this reallocation (and the subsequent reallocation involving ec Pictogram shares), member-stockholders may ultimately receive more or fewer shares than initially allocated to them, depending on the relative performance of the Europe region and their individual global proxy calculations at the time. If a member's revenue contribution, GDV and/or GAV during the period prior to reallocation grows more slowly than the membership as a whole, if any of these amounts decline for a member relative to other members, or if a member with ec Pictogram volumes fails to convert these to Maestro as required, the member may be entitled to fewer shares upon reallocation than at the closing of the conversion and integration. Members receiving additional shares upon reallocation will do so pursuant to rights initially granted with all shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. ec Pictogram Shares. ec Pictogram shares are class B convertible shares that do not convert to class A redeemable shares at the conclusion of the transition period. Instead, ec Pictogram shares will convert to class A redeemable shares on the second anniversary of the end of the transition period. This additional two- 64
year holding period is designed to recognize that additional time may be needed before the transaction volumes associated with ec Pictogram, a regional debit program owned by Europay, can be converted to Maestro volumes. All class B convertible shares representing ec Pictogram shares become non-voting at the end of the transition period when the other class B convertible shares convert to class A redeemable shares. The number of ec Pictogram shares will be calculated at the end of the transition period according to the following procedures: - The aggregate global proxy calculation of Europe during the third year of the transition period will be determined. - Then, a simulated global proxy will be calculated assuming that certain ec Pictogram transactions are converted to Maestro transactions as of the beginning of the third year of the transition period. Because Maestro transactions are accorded a higher GDV and GAV weighting than ec Pictogram transactions, the simulated result is likely to be higher than the actual European aggregate global proxy calculation. ec Pictogram transactions will be accorded a higher weighting in the simulated proxy if they are associated with binding contracts to convert to Maestro within a two-year period following the end of the transition period. - The difference between the actual global proxy and the simulated global proxy results described above, measured in terms of a percentage of the outstanding class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated, will determine the number of shares of class B convertible common stock that constitutes the ec Pictogram shares. If the simulated global proxy is equal to or less than the actual global proxy (as measured), there will be no ec Pictogram shares. - Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, ec Pictogram shares cannot exceed 5 1/3% of the total shares of MasterCard Incorporated then outstanding. In addition, ec Pictogram shares will be reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of any over-apportionment of shares to Europe in connection with the thresholds described below under the heading "-- Reapportionment of class A redeemable Shares Between Europe and Non-Europe." Reapportionment of Class A Redeemable Shares Between Europe and Non-Europe. At the end of the three-year transition period, MasterCard Incorporated will determine the global proxy calculation of all member-stockholders (calculated on a single worldwide basis) for the last 12 months of the transition period. The European member-stockholders will be entitled to more or fewer class A redeemable shares depending upon their aggregate global proxy calculation, and the non-European member-stockholders will be entitled to the remaining class A redeemable shares. The purpose of the reapportionment is to permit the final allocation of shares of MasterCard Incorporated to be based on the relative aggregate global proxy calculations of the European and non-European areas during the last year of the transition period. Specifically: - Europe Less than or Equal to 26%. If the global proxy calculation indicates that European member-stockholders in the aggregate represent 26% or less of the worldwide global proxy calculation for the last year of the transition period, then the European member-stockholders will be entitled to an allocation of shares of class A redeemable common stock that represents 26% of the number of shares of outstanding class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock. - Europe Greater than 26% but Less than or Equal to 28%. If the global proxy calculation indicates that European member-stockholders in the aggregate represent greater than 26% but less than or equal to 28% of the worldwide global proxy calculation for the last year of the transition period, then the European member-stockholders will be entitled to an allocation of shares of class A redeemable common stock that represents 28% of the number of shares of outstanding class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock. - Europe Greater than 28%. If the global proxy calculation indicates that European member-stockholders in the aggregate represent greater than 28% of the worldwide global proxy calculation for the last year of the transition period, then the European member-stockholders will be entitled to an allocation of shares of class A redeemable common stock that is equal in percentage terms to their 65
aggregate global proxy calculation for the last year of the transition period, up to a maximum amount, when taken together with any ec Pictogram shares, of 44% of the number of shares of outstanding class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock. Because of the conversion of the class B convertible common stock at the end of the transition period, the only class B convertible common stock outstanding at the time of this calculation will be the ec Pictogram shares, if any. In the reapportionment, stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated whose initial share allocations decrease will return shares initially allocated to them to MasterCard Incorporated, which will deliver shares to stockholders whose initial share allocations increase. Each Member-Stockholder's Global Proxy Calculation. As in the case of the allocation of shares at the closing, the apportionment of class A redeemable shares between Europe and non-Europe described above will produce two pools of class A redeemable shares, one for European member-stockholders and the other for non-European member-stockholders. The allocation of class A redeemable shares within each pool will be determined according to the new global proxy calculated on a regional basis for the last year of the transition period, as described above under the heading "-- The Initial Allocation of Shares -- Initial Reallocation of Shares Pursuant to the Global Proxy Calculation." CONVERSION AND REALLOCATION OF EC PICTOGRAM SHARES At the end of the additional two-year holding period, all ec Pictogram shares will be converted to class A redeemable shares, and the class A redeemable shares will then be subject to reallocation. European member- stockholders with ec Pictogram volumes that have converted to Maestro volumes will be entitled to some or all of those class A redeemable shares depending upon the percentage of ec Pictogram volumes that have actually been converted to Maestro by that time. Non-European member-stockholders will be entitled to the balance, which will be distributed to those member-stockholders in accordance with the new global proxy formula based on the 12 month period ending at the end of the additional two-year holding period. Any reallocation of class A redeemable shares resulting from the conversion of ec Pictogram shares will be effected by a return of shares to MasterCard Incorporated and delivery of shares by MasterCard Incorporated. Members receiving additional shares upon reallocation will do so pursuant to rights initially granted with all shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. GLOBAL PROXY CALCULATION FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION PERIOD AND CONVERSION OF THE EC PICTOGRAM SHARES Following the transition period and the conversion of the ec Pictogram shares to class A redeemable voting shares, the global proxy calculation will be performed on an individual member-stockholder basis according to the procedures described above under the heading "-- The Global Proxy." The European and non-European areas will cease to have any significance in connection with the determination of the global proxy. After the transition period, member-stockholders will be required to maintain an ownership percentage of MasterCard's outstanding common stock of not less than 75% nor more than 125% of that member-stockholder's most recent global proxy calculation. Stockholders may be required to purchase or sell shares of MasterCard Incorporated in order to satisfy these requirements within 12 months of receipt of notice from MasterCard Incorporated that such purchase or sale is required. Any sales of shares would ordinarily constitute taxable transactions. Stockholders who need to sell shares in order to satisfy the 125% requirement are obligated under the bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated to accept the highest price offered to them for the shares that are required to be sold. To the extent that member-stockholders are required to purchase shares in order to satisfy the 75% minimum ownership requirement, shares will be available either directly from MasterCard Incorporated or from other member-stockholders that either are required to sell shares in order to satisfy the 125% maximum ownership requirement or otherwise desire to sell shares. The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated is authorized to establish procedures by which shares of MasterCard Incorporated common stock will be traded among member-stockholders or purchased or sold by MasterCard. Methods for the purchase and disposition of shares may include some or all of the following: an on-line bulletin board that matches buyers and sellers of shares; a periodic auction conducted on behalf of MasterCard Incorporated for buyers and sellers of shares; and directly negotiated purchases and sales of shares. The price at which shares may be purchased or sold will 66
be determined through these methods. MasterCard Incorporated will not charge member-stockholders any commissions for facilitating trading in its shares. MasterCard Incorporated will purchase or sell its common stock subject to its having sufficient capital available to effect each purchase transaction, and only if each purchase or sale transaction is permitted under the laws, rules and regulations applicable to MasterCard Incorporated at the time (including securities laws). In particular, to the extent any offer by MasterCard Incorporated to purchase its shares constitutes a tender offer under the Exchange Act, MasterCard Incorporated will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and regulations. In addition, MasterCard Incorporated will undertake activities to facilitate trading of its common stock among member-stockholders only to the extent such activities are permitted under the federal and state securities laws of the United States and related rules and regulations. Any shares subsequently sold by MasterCard Incorporated may not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and accordingly may be subject to resale restrictions under the Securities Act. 67
MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The directors and executive officers of MasterCard Incorporated after the conversion and integration will be the same as the directors and executive officers of MasterCard International before the conversion and integration, except for the addition of two voting directors affiliated with European members and the addition of Dr. Peter Hoch, currently Chief Executive Officer of Europay, who will be President of MasterCard's Europe region and a non-voting director. The certificate of incorporation of MasterCard International requires MasterCard Incorporated, as the sole class B member, to elect the directors of MasterCard Incorporated to serve as the directors of MasterCard International. MasterCard Incorporated will have a board comprised of 18 voting directors. One member-stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated holding more than 5% of MasterCard Incorporated common stock is entitled to cancel its customized member agreement with MasterCard International if one of its employees does not have a board seat. If the conversion is approved, the current directors of MasterCard International will serve as the directors of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International until the annual meeting of MasterCard Incorporated shareholders in 2003. In addition, the boards of directors of each company, acting pursuant to authority granted to them in their respective certificates of incorporation and/or bylaws, will appoint two additional voting directors affiliated with European members and Dr. Peter Hoch as a non-voting director, in each case to serve until the annual meeting of MasterCard Incorporated shareholders in 2003. The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated will be subject to reelection in 2003. If the conversion does not occur, the current directors of MasterCard International will continue in that capacity until an annual meeting of MasterCard International principal members is held in 2003. A number of the largest members of MasterCard International that generate significant business for MasterCard have representatives on the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors. If any of these members were to lose its representation on the board, this could have a detrimental effect on our business relationship with that member. The bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated require that directors be officers of a member institution of MasterCard International or an individual otherwise uniquely qualified to provide guidance on MasterCard's affairs. For a description of the requirements for the regional allocation of board seats arising from the conversion and integration, see "The Conversion -- Effects of the Conversion." In accordance with the restrictions described in that section, the nominating committee of the MasterCard Incorporated board is charged with nominating individuals to serve as directors, subject to election by the stockholders. Presently, MasterCard Incorporated does not grant automatic board seats to members that generate specified levels of revenues or transaction volumes for MasterCard. Under the nominating committee's current procedures, the committee accepts nominations from regional boards as well as individual member-stockholders, and also considers nominees of its own volition. In selecting nominees, the committee typically considers the following factors, among others: - the experience and qualifications of the individual nominee; - the region with which the nominee is associated; - whether the nominee represents an issuing or acquiring institution; - the size of the financial institution of which the nominee is an officer, the extent of such institution's business with MasterCard (in terms of revenues, issuing volumes and/or acquiring volumes), and the degree of such institution's relative dedication to the MasterCard brand; and - whether the financial institution of which the nominee is an officer is of particular strategic importance to MasterCard. Because the size of member-stockholders and their dedication to MasterCard are important factors considered by the nominating committee, it is possible that a director associated with a member-stockholder whose business with MasterCard declines relative to others may not be proposed for reelection by the 125
nominating committee. Similarly, officers of member-stockholders that make large and growing contributions to MasterCard's revenues and volumes are more likely to be considered by the nominating committee for nomination to the board of directors. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the executive officers and directors of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International after the conversion and integration.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN-AWARDS IN FISCAL YEAR 2001 The following table lists grants of performance units in 2001 to the named executive officers: - --------------- (1) The performance units were granted under MasterCard International's Executive Incentive Plan. Each performance unit has a target value equal to $100. The actual value of each unit will be calculated based on MasterCard International's performance over a three-year period based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures that include: improving profitable share with key members in key markets; improving customer focused strategy; achieving corporate financial targets and enhancing organizational capabilities. Each unit will be valued at target ($100) if, on a weighted-average basis, target performance is achieved for all of the performance measures. Each unit will be valued at threshold ($50) if, on a weighted-average basis, threshold performance is achieved. Each unit will be valued at maximum ($200) if, on a weighted-average basis, maximum performance is achieved. For performance between threshold and target or target and maximum, the value of the units will be increased on a straight line basis. The units will have no value if performance is below threshold. (2) Represents one-time special grants awarded pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan that vests 100% after five years for Mr. Selander; three years for Mr. Heuer, Mr. McElhatton and Ms. Fletcher. The performance units described in the preceding table are subject to vesting as described below. Performance units that relate to a three-year performance period will vest in annual increments according to the following schedule if the participant completes 1,000 hours of service and is employed by MasterCard International on the last day of the respective twelve-month cycle: Unvested performance units relating to the twelve-month cycle in which a participant terminates employment with MasterCard International, and subsequent twelve-month cycles during the vesting period for the award, will be forfeited upon termination of employment. If a participant is rehired during a subsequent twelve-month cycle in the vesting period for the same award of performance units, the participant will be eligible to vest in the performance units for the award that relate to the twelve-month cycle of rehiring and subsequent twelve-month cycles if the participant otherwise meets the terms and conditions specified in the award and completes 1,000 hours of service in, and is employed by MasterCard International on the last day of, the twelve-month cycle. 132
Upon completion of the three-year performance period, participants will receive a payout equal to 80% of the award earned. The remaining 20% of the award will be paid upon completion of two additional years of service, (i.e., 5 years of service in total). Participants who retire (with at least six months of service during the performance period), die or become permanently disabled prior to the end of the three-year performance period and/or prior to the end of the five-year performance period are eligible for 100% vesting of their units, and receive a payout equal to the number of units granted for the period multiplied by the target unit value of $100. If a participant is terminated for cause, all units will be forfeited. Upon any other termination, only unvested units will be forfeited and vested units will be paid at target. RETIREMENT BENEFITS MASTERCARD ACCUMULATION PLAN (MAP) Any employee who participates in the MAP earns benefits under the MAP as soon as he or she becomes an employee of MasterCard. Benefits generally vest after four years of service. For each plan year after January 1, 2000, participants are credited with a percentage of their compensation for the plan year in accordance with the table below: Compensation is defined as base pay plus annual incentive compensation. These accounts also receive investment credits. Participants elect to allocate their account balance prior to the start of each plan year, during open enrollment, based on the following allocation options: The annual investment credits on the Standard & Poor's 500 Account are restricted to a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 15%. No election can be made for plan years beginning after December 31, 2002. When a participant terminates employment, the amount credited to the participant's account is paid in a lump sum or converted into an annuity. SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS Supplemental retirement benefits are provided to all named executive officers and certain other participants under various funded and unfunded nonqualified plans. Benefits are provided to certain employees whose benefits are limited by compensation or amount under applicable federal tax laws and regulations. Designated employees may also receive an annual benefit at retirement equal to a designated percentage of their final average base compensation reduced by the amount of all benefits received under the MAP and other qualified and nonqualified arrangements. 133
ESTIMATED ANNUAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS PAYABLE TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The following table shows the estimated annual retirement benefits, including supplemental retirement benefits under the plans applicable to the individuals, which would be payable to each executive officer listed assuming retirement at age 65 at his or her 2001 base salary with payments made for the life of each participant. - --------------- (1) Assumes MAP and Annuity Bonus Plan account balance increases with annual salary credits and interest credits projected at 6% per year. Included in the Estimated Annual Benefit in the table above is the MAP Conversion Annuity, part of MasterCard's nonqualified defined benefit plan, which was applicable to all executives with earnings exceeding the Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17) limit. This annuity was designed to cover certain early retirement subsidies applicable under the former pension plan to all plan participants. The aggregate annuity for certain named executive officers exceeded $100,000 (Mr. Selander -- $194,693, Mr. Heuer -- $136,696, Mr. McElhatton -- $130,514, Mr. Thom -- $114,057). 401(k) SAVINGS PLAN Employees who participate in the 401(k) plan may contribute from 2% to 6% of base pay on a tax-deferred basis. In addition, after-tax contributions are permitted, and employees may also contribute supplemental tax-deferred and after-tax amounts from 1% to 3%. Internal Revenue Service limits apply to all tax-deferred contributions. A 217% match is provided on employee contributions up to 6% of base pay. Employees must contribute to the 401(k) plan to receive matching contributions. Matching contributions are 100% vested after 4 years of service under a graded vesting schedule. Loans and certain types of withdrawals are permitted. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Members of the board of MasterCard Incorporated will receive the same compensation as members of the board of MasterCard International before the conversion as set forth below. The board of MasterCard Incorporated does not intend to establish any compensation for members of the board of MasterCard International. In fiscal year 2001, directors who were not employees of MasterCard International were paid an annual retainer of $25,000. The chairman of the board received an annual retainer of $30,000. Non-employee directors also received an annual retainer of $5,000 for serving as a chairperson of a standing committee; a $1,500 meeting fee for attendance at global and U.S. regional board meetings; a $1,000 meeting fee for attendance at committee meetings and a $500 meeting fee for telephonic meetings. In addition, customary expenses for attending board and committee meetings were reimbursed. Under the MasterCard Deferral Plan, up to 100% of non-employee director's meeting fees and annual retainer may be deferred and invested among several investment return options. In general, deferred amounts are not paid until after the director retires from the board. The amounts are then paid, at the director's option, either in a lump sum or in ten annual installments. 134
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT MasterCard International is party to an employment agreement with Mr. Selander. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Selander's employment shall automatically terminate if he: (1) retires or becomes eligible to receive retirement benefits; (2) dies or (3) becomes disabled. In addition, both he and MasterCard can terminate the agreement for any reason upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice. During the employment term, Mr. Selander is eligible to participate in MasterCard's rewards plans and arrangements on a level commensurate with his position. The agreement also provides that if Mr. Selander's employment is terminated either by MasterCard other than for cause or by him for certain specified reasons, he shall receive any earned, but unpaid base salary, a pro rata portion of his target bonus and severance pay in the form of base salary continuation and his average annual incentive bonus, received over the prior three years, for a period of thirty-six (36) months. He is also subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for a minimum period of twelve (12) months, up to the full length of the severance period. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Selander is eligible for annual company contributions of up to $150,000 to a rabbi trust or other tax deferred investment vehicle. $50,000 of this amount is guaranteed and the remaining $100,000 is based upon MasterCard attaining certain threshold and target performance goals. Generally, the vested portion of the assets is payable at the later of age 55 or his termination of employment. CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS MasterCard International has approved a change in control agreement for certain of its executive officers, including all of the named executive officers. To date, Mr. Selander is the only executive officer who has executed the change in control agreement. Under the agreement, if an executive officer's employment is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) during the six-month period preceding or the two-year period following a "change in control" of MasterCard International, the executive will be entitled to the following: - a severance payment equal to two times the average base salary and bonus (three times in the case of the CEO), payable over a 24-month period (36 months in the case of the CEO), subject to recalculation to be payable over the period until the executive is eligible to retire (without any increase in the amount payable); - continued coverage under the executive's individual long-term disability plan for the 24- or 36-month period; - continued coverage in the medical, dental, hospitalization and vision care plans for up to eighteen months; - accelerated vesting of performance units including special grants awarded prior to the change in control under the Executive Incentive Plan, with payout at 125% of target; - accelerated vesting of appreciation of share units granted under the value appreciation plan; - accelerated vesting of special grants awarded pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan, nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefits; - lump sum payment equal to the value of unvested qualified plan benefits; - outplacement assistance; and - an excise tax gross-up for any taxes incurred as a result of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive would be subject to a covenant not to compete and not to solicit employees for up to 24-months (36 in the case of the CEO). 135
For purposes of the agreement, a "change in control" is defined as follows: (a) as long as MasterCard International is a non-stock membership corporation or it or any of its affiliates is a private share corporation, if (1) at any time three members have become entitled to cast at least 45 percent of the votes eligible to be cast by all the members of MasterCard International (or all the shareholders of such private share corporation) on any issue, (2) at any time, a plan or agreement is approved by the members or shareholders, as the case may be, to sell, transfer, assign, lease or exchange substantially all of MasterCard International's (or such private share corporations') assets, or (3) at any time, a plan is approved by the members of MasterCard International (or the shareholders of such private share corporation) for the sale or liquidation of MasterCard International or such private share corporation. The foregoing notwithstanding, a reorganization in which the members continue to have all of the ownership rights in the continuing entity shall not in and of itself be deemed a "change of control" under (2) and/or (3), and a reorganization to convert MasterCard International from a membership to a stock company or a transaction resulting in the integration of Europay and MasterCard International shall not in and of itself constitute a "change of control;" (b) if MasterCard International becomes a stock corporation, the approval of its stockholders of (1) any consolidation or merger in which it is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger in which the holders of stock immediately prior to the merger will have the same proportionate ownership interest (i.e., still own 100% of total) of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, (2) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of its assets, or (3) adoption of any plan or proposal for its liquidation or dissolution; (c) any "person" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), other than MasterCard International or a subsidiary or employee benefit plan or trust maintained by MasterCard International or any of its subsidiaries, becoming (together with its "affiliates" and "associates," as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the stock outstanding at the time, without the prior approval of the board of directors; or (d) a majority of the voting directors proposed on a slate for election by the members are rejected by a vote of those members. 136

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF MASTERCARD INCORPORATED The following summary of MasterCard Incorporated's capital stock describes the material terms of the stock. For a complete description, we refer you to MasterCard Incorporated's charter and bylaws, which are attached as Annexes D and E to this proxy statement-prospectus. GENERAL Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of MasterCard Incorporated consists of: - 275 million shares of class A redeemable common stock, par value $.01 per share; - 25 million shares of class B convertible common stock, par value $.01 per share; and - 75 million shares of class C common stock, par value $.01 per share. Immediately following the closing of the conversion and integration, 84 million shares of class A redeemable common stock will be issued and outstanding, 16 million shares of class B convertible common stock will be issued and outstanding and no shares of class C common stock will be issued and outstanding. MasterCard Incorporated may only issue the class B convertible common stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by the integration agreement. Conversion of Class B convertible common stock. Each share of class B convertible common stock, except shares that constitute ec Pictogram shares, will automatically be converted into one share of class A redeemable common stock on the third anniversary of the first day of the first fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter in which the closing of the conversion and integration occurs. Shares of class B convertible common stock that are ec Pictogram shares will automatically be converted into one share of class A redeemable common stock on the second anniversary of the day on which all of the other shares of class B convertible common stock were converted and some or all of these shares will be allocated among the members of MasterCard responsible for ec Pictogram volumes to the extent such volumes have been previously converted to Maestro, in accordance with the terms of the integration agreement. Any remaining shares will be allocated to non-European member-stockholders. Reallocation. At the conclusion of the three year transition period, all shares of class A redeemable common stock, including class A redeemable common stock resulting from the conversion of class B convertible common stock, will be subject to reallocation as described more fully under "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy -- Reallocation of Shares at the Conclusion of the Transition Period." In connection with this reallocation, shareholders may be required to return some or all of their common stock to MasterCard Incorporated for reallocation. In addition, ec Pictogram shares will be subject to reallocation at the conclusion of an additional two year period following the transition period as described more fully under "-- Conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock" above. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of class A redeemable or class B convertible common stock will be issued or delivered by MasterCard Incorporated. Any fractional share interests will be rounded to a whole share in such manner as the management of MasterCard Incorporated may determine in its sole discretion. VOTING RIGHTS, DIVIDEND RIGHTS AND LIQUIDATION RIGHTS Voting Rights. Each holder of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock has the right to cast one vote for each share of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated. At the end of the transition period, all shares of class B convertible common stock, except for class B convertible shares relating to ec Pictogram, will be converted into class A redeemable common stock. Following this conversion, the remaining class B convertible common stock will have no voting rights. At all times, each holder of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock, together with its affiliates, will be subject to a 7% voting limitation in the election of directors regardless of the number of shares owned. This provision may be altered by a majority vote of the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors or by a majority of the holders of the class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common stock voting together as a single class (so long as 141
the class B convertible stock has voting rights). However, approval of at least 75% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is required to raise the limitation on voting for directors to more than 15% of the shares that are entitled to vote in the election of directors. The above provisions may be amended only with the approval of 75% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present and the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock voting together as a single class (so long as the class B convertible stock has voting rights). Dividend Rights. The holders of shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends or distributions, if, as and when dividends or distributions are declared by the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated at its discretion. MasterCard Incorporated has no current plans to pay cash dividends on the common stock. Liquidation Rights. Upon dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of MasterCard Incorporated, holders of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock are entitled to share ratably in the net assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of debts and other liabilities, subject to the prior rights of any issued preferred shares. Redemption Rights. If, within three years after the closing of the conversion, a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated ceases to be a principal member of MasterCard International (other than in connection with a permitted transfer of shares as described under "-- Transfer Restrictions" below), MasterCard Incorporated will redeem that stockholder at par value. If more than three years have elapsed since the conversion and a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated ceases to be a principal member of MasterCard International, MasterCard Incorporated may, at its option, redeem the shares of that stockholder for their book value based on MasterCard Incorporated's financial statements most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If MasterCard Incorporated does not redeem the stockholder's shares, the stockholder will be required to offer the unpurchased shares to the other stockholders in accordance with procedures to be established by the board of directors. Certain Purchase and Sale Obligations. Beginning three years after the conversion and integration, no stockholder may own common stock representing more than 125% or less than 75% of that stockholder's most recent global proxy calculation. Stockholders may be required to purchase or sell shares of MasterCard Incorporated in order to satisfy these requirements within 12 months of receipt of notice from MasterCard Incorporated that such purchase or sale is required. Any sales of shares would ordinarily constitute taxable transactions. Stockholders who need to sell shares in order to satisfy the 125% requirement are obligated under the bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated to accept the highest price offered to them for the shares that are required to be sold. To the extent that member-stockholders are required to purchase shares in order to satisfy the 75% minimum ownership requirement, shares will be available either directly from MasterCard Incorporated or from other member-stockholders that either are required to sell shares in order to satisfy the 125% maximum ownership requirement or otherwise desire to sell shares. The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated is authorized to establish procedures by which shares of MasterCard Incorporated common stock will be traded among member-stockholders or purchased or sold by MasterCard. Methods for the purchase and disposition of shares may include some or all of the following: an on-line bulletin board that matches buyers and sellers of shares; a periodic auction conducted on behalf of MasterCard Incorporated for buyers and sellers of shares; and directly negotiated purchases and sales of shares. The price at which shares may be purchased or sold will be determined through these methods. MasterCard Incorporated will not charge member-stockholders any commissions for facilitating trading in its shares. MasterCard Incorporated will purchase or sell its common stock subject to its having sufficient capital available to effect each purchase transaction, and only if each purchase or sale transaction is permitted under the laws, rules and regulations applicable to MasterCard Incorporated at the time (including securities laws). In particular, to the extent any offer by MasterCard Incorporated to purchase its shares constitutes a tender offer under the Exchange Act, MasterCard Incorporated will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and regulations. In addition, MasterCard Incorporated will undertake activities to facilitate trading of its common stock among member-stockholders only to the extent such activities are permitted under the federal and state 142
securities laws of the United States and related rules and regulations. Any shares subsequently sold by MasterCard Incorporated may not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and accordingly may be subject to resale restrictions under the Securities Act. Rights. Holders of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock have the right under the terms of the integration agreement and as provided for in the bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated to receive additional shares at the end of the three-year transition period to the extent that their new global proxy calculation for the third year of the transition period (calculated on a European or non-European basis, as the case may be) exceeds their initial allocation of shares. See "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy -- Reallocation of Shares at the Conclusion of the Transition Period." Similarly, holders of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock have the right to receive additional shares in certain circumstances in connection with the reallocation of ec Pictogram shares. See "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy -- Conversion and Reallocation of ec Pictogram Shares." Members receiving additional shares at the end of the three-year transition period and/or in connection with the reallocation of ec Pictogram shares will do so pursuant to rights initially granted with all shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Each right is transferable only with the applicable shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock, expires or terminates upon completion of the final reallocation and is not redeemable except together with the redemption of a share of class A redeemable or class B convertible common stock. Other than the right and as otherwise described herein, holders of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock do not have any rights to purchase additional shares of stock from MasterCard Incorporated, to have their common stock converted into or exchanged for other securities (except for the conversion of class B convertible shares into class A redeemable shares as described above), to have their common stock repurchased by MasterCard Incorporated or to receive a preferred return on their shares of common stock. Class C Common Stock. Shares of class C common stock may be issued from time to time with voting powers, designations, preferences and other rights to be determined by the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors, provided that no shares of class C common stock may be entitled to voting rights, dividends or rights to participate in the proceeds of a liquidation that are greater than the corresponding rights of the class A redeemable common stock. The MasterCard Incorporated certificate of incorporation provides that any issuance of class C common stock requires the approval of two-thirds of the board of directors, and that any issuance of voting class C common stock or class C common stock that, together with all other issuances of class C common stock made during the immediately preceding two years, represents greater than 5% of the total number of class A redeemable shares and class B convertible shares outstanding prior to the issuance requires the approval of 75% of the board of directors. These provisions may be amended only with the approval of 75% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present and the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock voting together as a single class (so long as the class B convertible stock has voting rights). TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS For three years following the closing of the conversion, no transfer of shares of common stock and no assignment of the right to receive shares will be permitted except: - in connection with a transfer of all or substantially all of a stockholder's card portfolio; - in the event that a stockholder that was a principal member becomes an affiliate member of another principal member, in which case the stockholder may transfer its common stock to the principal member with which it becomes affiliated; - in the event that a stockholder that was a principal member with one or more affiliate members ceases to be a principal member and one or more of its affiliate members thereupon become principal members, in which case the stockholder may transfer its common stock to the former affiliate members; 143
- if a stockholder is prohibited from holding the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated by applicable regulatory requirements, in which case the stockholder may transfer its common stock to an affiliate that is permitted to hold the stock, with the prior approval of the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated; and - a stockholder may transfer shares to a class A member of MasterCard International that is an affiliate of such stockholder with the approval of the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated. For these purposes, an affiliate is any parent company that directly or indirectly owns 80% or more of the voting power and economic interests in the stockholder, and any entity of which the stockholder or any of such parents owns 80% or more of the voting power and economic interests. The permissible transfers described above apply only to transfers of all, but not less than all, of a stockholder's shares in MasterCard Incorporated. After three years, each stockholder must maintain an ownership percentage of MasterCard Incorporated common stock that is no less than 75% and no more than 125% of the stockholder's most recent global proxy calculation. Stockholders may be required to purchase or sell shares of MasterCard Incorporated in order to satisfy these requirements within 12 months of receipt of notice from MasterCard Incorporated that such purchase or sale is required. Any sales of shares would ordinarily constitute taxable transactions. Stockholders who need to sell shares in order to satisfy the 125% requirement are obligated under the bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated to accept the highest price offered to them for the shares that are required to be sold. In addition: - only class A members of MasterCard International may own shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated; and - unless otherwise approved by a two-thirds vote of the MasterCard Incorporated board of directors, no stockholder together with its affiliates may own more than 15% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Following the three year transition period, MasterCard Incorporated intends to facilitate trading of its common stock among class A members of MasterCard International according to procedures to be established by the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated. See "-- Certain Purchase or Sale Obligations." The shares of MasterCard Incorporated common stock that MasterCard International members will own following the conversion and integration have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. They may be traded in accordance with the transfer restrictions contained in this section by you if you are not an affiliate of MasterCard International under the Securities Act. An "affiliate" as defined by the rules under the Securities Act is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, MasterCard International. Persons who are affiliates of MasterCard International may not sell their shares of MasterCard Incorporated common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the requirements of the Securities Act, including Rules 144 and 145 issued by the SEC under the Securities Act. Affiliates generally include directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of 10% or more of any class of capital stock. TRANSFER AGENT Initially, MasterCard Incorporated will be the transfer agent and registrar of the common stock. LIMITATIONS ON A CHANGE OF CONTROL We summarize below several provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of MasterCard Incorporated or deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our stockholders. This could be the case even though a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. These descriptions are not complete and we refer you to the documents that we have filed as exhibits to this proxy statement-prospectus and to the Delaware General Corporation Law. 144
Supermajority Vote of the Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation requires the approval of 75% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present and the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock voting together as a single class (so long as the class B convertible common stock has voting rights) to: alter our status as a stock corporation; amend our certificate of incorporation to authorize MasterCard Incorporated to issue stock other than class A redeemable, B convertible or C common stock; sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of MasterCard Incorporated's assets; approve the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantial all of the assets of MasterCard International; engage in a business combination (merger or consolidation) involving either MasterCard Incorporated or MasterCard International; undertake an initial public offering; amend the MasterCard International certificate of incorporation to allow MasterCard International to issue capital stock, to create additional classes of membership interests in MasterCard International, to subject the property of the members of MasterCard International to the obligations of MasterCard International or to subject non-U.S. programs to the satisfaction of any liabilities arising from the current DOJ and merchant antitrust litigations in the United States; or amend the provisions of the MasterCard International bylaws relating to special assessments that may be imposed upon the members of MasterCard International. Other provisions of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International may be modified only if certain supermajorities are achieved, and these provisions may have the effect of deterring potential acquirors. See "Comparison of Rights of MasterCard International Members Before and After the Conversion and Integration." Ability to Call Special Meetings. Special meetings of MasterCard Incorporated stockholders may be called at any time for any purpose by written request of the chairman of the board of directors or the President and Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard Incorporated. Special meetings may also be called by the Secretary upon the written request of at least 33 1/3% of the board of directors or the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the action being proposed. Notice of a special meeting must state the time, place and date of the meeting, the name of the person or persons calling the meeting, the purpose for which the meeting is called and the means of acceptable remote participation. The business transacted at the special meeting is limited to the purpose described in the notice. 15% Share Ownership Limitation. Unless otherwise approved by a two-thirds vote of the MasterCard board of directors, no stockholder together with its affiliates may own more than 15% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of MasterCard Incorporated. 7% Voting Power Limitation. Each holder of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock, together with its affiliates, will be subject to a 7% voting limitation in the election of directors regardless of the number of shares owned. Only Class A Members of MasterCard International may be Stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated. Only class A members of MasterCard International may own shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Authorized but Unissued Shares of Class C Common Stock. Since the board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated may issue shares of class C common stock and set the voting powers, designations, preferences and other rights related to that stock, any issuance of class C shares may delay or prevent a change of control. DELAWARE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTE Under Section 203 of the business combination statute of Delaware law, a corporation is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder who, together with its affiliates or associates, owns 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock for a three year period following the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: - prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; 145
- the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation, excluding specified shares, upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; or - at or subsequent to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized by the affirmative vote, at an annual or special meeting and not by written consent, of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, excluding shares held by that interested stockholder. A business combination generally includes: - mergers, consolidations and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets of a corporation to or with an interested stockholder; - specified transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to an interested stockholder of any capital stock of the corporation or its subsidiaries; and - other transactions resulting in a disproportionate financial benefit to an interested stockholder. The provisions of the Delaware business combination statute do not apply to a corporation if, subject to certain requirements, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the corporation contain a provision expressly electing not to be governed by the provisions of the statute or the corporation does not have voting stock listed on a national securities exchange, authorized for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders. Although MasterCard Incorporated does not plan to "opt out" of this provision, Section 203 will not apply as long as we have fewer than 2,000 stockholders. In addition, the provision may not be meaningful as a result of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, including the provision prohibiting stockholders from holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock. LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Delaware law provides that a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation a provision limiting or eliminating the liability of its directors to the corporation and its stockholders for monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty, except for: - a breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; - payment of a dividend or the repurchase or redemption of stock in violation of Delaware law; or - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent Delaware law permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, none of our directors will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Our bylaws require, among other things, that we indemnify our officers and directors against all expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of MasterCard Incorporated. We are also permitted to advance to the officers and directors all related expenses, subject to reimbursement if it is determined subsequently that indemnification is not permitted. 146

NEWS RELEASE MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL --------------- Contacts: Sharon Gamsin, 914-249-5622 MASTERCARD MERGES WITH EUROPAY TO FORM A UNIFIED, SHAREHOLDER-OWNED, GLOBAL PAYMENTS COMPANY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE ESTABLISHED TO LEVERAGE EXPERTISE AROUND THE GLOBE PURCHASE, NY AND WATERLOO, BELGIUM, JULY 1, 2002 - The conversion of MasterCard International into a private share corporation and its merger with Europay International have been completed, creating a unified, shareholder-owned global payments company, which will deliver significant benefits to customers around the globe. "The integration of MasterCard and Europay unites two of the strongest players in the payments business so that we can now deploy a truly globally integrated, regionally sensitive strategic model," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard's president and CEO. "By integrating with Europay, we're enhancing our ability to deliver high-quality, reliable payment solutions to our members globally, while maintaining regional flexibility that is responsive to local market requirements and conditions." Selander said that by joining Europay's strength in m-commerce, smart cards, and debit cards with MasterCard's leadership in customer relationship management, award-winning brand marketing, and leading-edge processing technology, "the financial institutions we serve will receive superior support and delivery whether they operate in one country, on one continent, or in diverse markets around the world." Europay, MasterCard's long-standing strategic ally in Europe, is being integrated into the global organization as MasterCard's Europe Region. The Europe Region will continue to be based in Waterloo, Belgium. Dr. Peter Hoch, Europay's chief executive, will continue his leadership as president of MasterCard's Europe Region, reporting to Selander. "Europay has just marked another critical milestone, with over 300 million cards now issued in our region. It's a proud moment at which to enter into this merger," said Hoch. "Our members have always benefited from our strategic alliance with MasterCard but the benefits of working as a truly integrated global company will now be all the greater." With a unified governance and management structure, MasterCard will increase strategic flexibility, strengthen customer responsiveness and shorten time-to-market for innovative products and services, Selander said. At the same time, MasterCard's regions - Europe, Asia/Pacific, Latin America/Caribbean, South Asia/Middle East/Africa and North America - will maintain their regional boards and the ability to decide how best to implement MasterCard's global strategy on a regional level, and establish rules and policies that reflect local practices. -more-
MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL - PAGE 2 MASTERCARD MERGES WITH EUROPAY TO FORM A UNIFIED SHAREHOLDER-OWNED GLOBAL PAYMENTS COMPANY JULY 1, 2002 THE CONVERSION - -------------- To facilitate the merger transaction with Europay, MasterCard created a private share corporation by issuing stock in a newly developed holding company, MasterCard Incorporated, to its principal members. MasterCard International, the membership corporation, will continue as MasterCard Incorporated's principal operating subsidiary. "As a private share corporation, we provide a tangible benefit to our principal members, who are now our shareholders," Selander added. "They own stock in our company and have a vested interest in enhancing the value of that stock by moving more volume, revenue, and share to MasterCard." Selander pointed out that as part of the process of becoming a private share company, MasterCard publicly disclosed detailed information about its business, and will file quarterly and annual financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "This increased level of financial transparency and precision is an important advantage in today's business environment, and a key differentiator from our competition," he said. THE INTEGRATION - --------------- The integration of MasterCard and Europay provides an opportunity to create substantial benefits for customers in terms of improved economies of scale, elimination of duplication, and faster decision making. This means MasterCard can be faster to market, delivering timely technology and marketing solutions to customers. Many of these benefits are already being realized. Full globalization of MasterCard's processing functions, for example, will provide a single set of applications and infrastructure for core processing, with significant economies of scale. The integration provides the opportunity for the Europe Region to further benefit from MasterCard's global expertise in brand building, customer-centered service, marketing consulting, and corporate payments expertise. For example, MasterCard's award-winning PRICELESS(R) advertising campaign, now seen in 45 languages and in 90 countries, including key European markets, will be expanded throughout the region, further enhancing the global reach and scope of MasterCard's brand. European customers will also benefit from the delivery of enhanced customized relationship management and consulting services. CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE - --------------------- As part of the newly integrated company, MasterCard is launching global Centers of Excellence in Belgium and the United States. The centers will provide the best solutions to meet the dynamic needs of MasterCard's members and their customers by offering information, resources, and tools to help build global leadership. The Center of Excellence for Debit and the Center of Excellence for Chip and Mobile Commerce will be located in Waterloo, Belgium, to leverage Europay's proven expertise in these areas. A third, the Center of Excellence for e-Commerce and eB2B, will be located in Purchase, New York. -more-

EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-29
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Europay International S.A.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Europay International S.A. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the Belgium, expressed in euros. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Accounting principles generally accepted in Belgium vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The application of the latter would have affected the determination of consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the determination of consolidated shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position at December 31, 2001 and 2000, to the extent summarized in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN E THOUSANDS) 1. ORGANIZATION Europay International S.A., incorporated in Belgium, manages and licenses banks and banking organizations in Europe for payment systems trademarks such as eurocheque, Eurocard-MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus and Clip. Services provided also include processing services such as authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions carried out under the above mentioned trademarks. Europay also engages in a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of the brands, and plays a leading role in the development of new technologies aimed at facilitating and expanding electronic and mobile commerce. 2. LIST OF CONSOLIDATED ENTERPRISES AND ENTERPRISES INCLUDED USING THE EQUITY METHOD The financial statements include the accounts of Europay and also the accounts of the subsidiaries listed below. 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. CONSOLIDATION Europay follows accounting principles and reporting requirements generally accepted in Belgium ("Belgian GAAP"). Assets and liabilities are recorded under the accrual method of accounting and valued at historical cost less any amounts provided for possible reduction in value. F-34
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Europay and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities for which the equity method of accounting is appropriate are reported as financial assets on the balance sheet. Europay's share of net earnings of these entities is included in the consolidated statements of income. Investments in entities for which the equity method is not appropriate are accounted for using historical cost. All investments are evaluated for impairment on an ongoing basis. REVENUES Revenues are recognized when services are performed. The main operating revenues arise from the following fees. Operations fees -- consists of authorization, clearing and settlement fees charged to issuers/acquirers based on transaction volumes either through settlement or through invoices. This also includes fees for other member services that are collected based on monthly invoices. Assessment fees -- consists of assessment fees charged to issuers and acquirers for costs associated with the overall management of the payments system, and currency conversion fees charged to issuers, which are charged daily, monthly and quarterly based on transaction volumes. These fees are recognized as revenue when collected through direct debit or upon invoicing of customers. Assessment fees also include card fees charged to issuers that are recognized as revenue upon invoicing of customers. Europay has strategic arrangements with certain members, which provide for fee rebates when the member meets certain transaction hurdles. Such rebates are calculated as incurred based upon member transaction levels and the contracted discount rates for the services provided, and are recorded as a reduction in revenue in the same period as the revenue is recorded. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The euro (E) is the functional currency for the majority of Europay's businesses except its Eurocard U.S.A. operations, where the local currency is the functional currency. Transactions arising from EMU countries in foreign currencies are translated at their EMU fixed rate. Bank movements generated by Europay's centralized processing system, known as European Common Clearing & Settlement System (ECCSS), are translated at the transaction date. All other transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated to and recorded in euros at the rate prevailing at the end of the month that precedes the month the transaction takes place, which is not significantly different from the rate at the respective transaction date. Current assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated at the spot rate on the balance sheet date. Profits and losses arising from the translation of foreign currencies are reflected in the statements of income. For businesses where the local currency is the functional currency, translation to euros is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets. DEFERRED TAXES Deferred tax liabilities on consolidation entries are recorded when it is probable that a tax charge will effectively be incurred in the foreseeable future. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Europay has strategic agreements with certain members, which include costs to obtain the member's commitment to perform under the terms and over the period of time defined in the agreement. These costs are F-35

Eligible direct internal and external costs related to the application development and testing stages of internally developed software are capitalized, and, upon completion are amortized using the straight-line method over a three year estimated useful life. All other intangible assets, which consist primarily of purchased software, are recorded at historical cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method between three and five years. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Land and buildings, plant and equipment, and office furniture and equipment are recorded at historical cost, including ancillary expenses. Depreciation is provided on buildings, plant and equipment and office furniture and equipment, at the following rates calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated for a full year in the year of acquisition. PENSIONS Europay has a defined benefit pension plan providing retirement and death benefits to employees, which is funded by a group insurance contract. Premiums charged by the insurance company are expensed as retirement benefits as incurred, on the assumption that the amount of the premium constitutes an appropriate measure of the economic cost of pension obligations for the period. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT It is Europay's policy to expense the costs of research and development, such as chip card research and development, in the year in which they are incurred. 4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS F-36
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) Europay capitalized work completed on the EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa) integrated circuit card, terminal and card application specifications for payment systems and related documents as intellectual property for estimated costs of E269 in 2000 and in doing so recognized income for the same amount, which is included in the 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income under capitalization of intangible assets. The EMV intangible assets have been contributed in their entirety as part of a capital contribution to a joint venture as described in Note 6 below. Starting in 1999 and continuing in 2000 Europay put in place systems and procedures in order to assess the criteria in respect of capitalization of internally developed software, which resulted in the effective capitalization of costs incurred as from January 1, 2000. Capitalized software amounting to E1,192 and related amortization expense of E9 should have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999. Under Belgian GAAP it is not permitted to restate opening retained earnings or to account for this non-capitalization in the following year. Europay capitalized internally developed software amounting to E7,737 and E7,553 in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization expense related to this capitalized software amounted to E2,691 and E602 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Europay capitalized costs amounting to E5,030 and advance payments amounting to E3,221, which were incurred to obtain members' commitment to perform under the terms and over the period of time defined in strategic agreements entered into with the members, in the year ended December 31, 2001. Amortization related to these capitalized costs amounted to E642 for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Assets under construction amounting to E482 and E2,655 were put into use and as such transferred to buildings during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In July 1999 Europay sold a building, which it formerly occupied, for a sales price of E3,718. Europay realized a loss of E124 on the sale. Europay rents network computer equipment required for network operations under an operating lease agreement. The value of the computer equipment rented under this lease agreement totaled E30,444 and E24,313 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Rent expense related to this lease amounted to E4,217, E4,717 and E5,231 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 1999 Europay rented personal computer equipment required for its activities under operating lease agreements. Rent expense related to these lease agreements amounted to E1,717 in 1999. In December 1999 Europay bought out the operating lease agreements. Under the terms of the transaction Europay acquired personal computer equipment at a cost of E632 and incurred a cancellation fee of E2,169, which was expensed. Europay provides cars to certain levels of management under operating lease agreements. In 2001 the terms of these operating lease agreements were changed from 4 to 3 1/2 years.

Total rents related to these lease agreements amounted to E5,553, E4,774 and E5,614 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) 6. FINANCIAL ASSETS Europay has a 33% interest in EMVCo, LLC ("EMVCo"), which it accounts for on an equity basis. EMVCo was established as a Delaware (U.S.) limited liability company established as a joint venture under equal ownership by Europay, MasterCard and Visa to manage, maintain and enhance the EMV Integrated Circuit Card Specifications for Payment Systems as technology advances and the implementation of chip card programs become more prevalent. In 2000 Europay's interest in EMVCo was increased by the contribution of additional intellectual property valued at E269 (see Note 4). Europay also has a 50% interest in a joint venture company, Maestro International Incorporated. ("Maestro"), of which the remaining 50% interest is held by MasterCard. At December 31, 1999 the net value of the investment in the joint venture was nil as the original investment of E184 was fully offset by loss provisions from previous years. In 2000 Europay reversed the loss provision of E184 and recognized a consolidation adjustment of E383 for the equity share of Maestro's undistributed 1999 net earnings. The reversal of the provision resulted from a change in the joint venture's profitability. Furthermore, the E383 income from the joint venture was F-40
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) recognized subsequent to 1999 or the period earned, and is reflected in the following required disclosure of consolidation differences:
Net carrying value at December 31, 2000..................... 383 Movements during the period: Adjustment as described above............................. -- --- Net carrying value at December 31, 2001..................... 383 ===
The Consolidated Balance Sheets include receivables from Maestro of E947 and E345 and payables to Maestro of E2,189 and E1,874 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Consolidated Income Statements include amounts of E5,773, E4,878 and E4,128 representing Europay's share of the net costs incurred by Maestro in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 7. CONSOLIDATED RESERVES 8. OTHER AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE Other amounts receivable consists of the following. In 2000 a same day settlement service called "Euro D0" for euro-currency transactions was implemented. This new service results in settlement receivables and payables arising from the two-day delay in the settlement of issued and acquired transactions between euro-currency members that settle on a same-day basis and non-euro currency members that settle two days later. See Note 12 for Euro D0 settlement payables. The income taxes receivable at December 31, 2001 includes a receivable amounting to E16,878 related to a disputed tax assessment from the Belgian tax authorities which is further described in Note 16. 9. INVESTMENTS AND DEPOSITS Europay had short-term deposits at December 31, 2001 of E6,500 and E2,500 at 3% and 3.4%, respectively, that matured on January 2, 2002. F-41
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) At December 31, 2001 Europay had signed forward exchange contracts to hedge projected U.S. dollar denominated expenses in 2002. Premiums and discounts on the forward exchange contracts are amortized pro rata from the contract date to the maturity date. The E1,852 investment at December 31, 2000 consists of foreign currency option premiums paid to cover future cash flows denominated in U.S. dollars. Option premium payments are recorded as short-term investments whereas option premiums received are recorded as deferred income. At December 31, 2000 Europay made a loss provision for E583 on a written option for the difference between the strike price of the option and the closing U.S. dollar exchange rate. This loss provision is included in provisions for liabilities and charges in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2000 and in net other financial income/(expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year then ended. The reversal of this provision upon maturity of the option in January 2001 is included in net other financial income/(expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year December 31, 2001. In January 1999 Europay bought a 12-month forward exchange contract for the purchase of U.S. dollars, which matured in December 1999. A gain of E5,509 realized on this contract is included in net other financial income/(expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 1999. The notional and estimated fair values of the outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: 10. CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND AND BANK OVERDRAFTS Cash at bank and in hand consists of the following: Cash includes E23,226 of cash on Europay's settlement bank accounts from Euro D0 (described in Note 8 above) and other settlement service operations. Europay requires and holds security deposits from certain members in order to ensure proper settlement of their transactions. The deposits are in euros or U.S. dollars and are placed on-call at market interest rates. At December 31, 2001 the applicable interest rates were 3.67% on euro deposits and 1.87% on U.S. dollar deposits. These amounts are fully offset by corresponding liabilities included in other amounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 12). The increase from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the addition of new members in Eastern Europe. F-42
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) The bank overdrafts and loans consist of the following: The overdraft on settlement bank accounts is due to Euro D0 and other settlement service operations. Overdrafts on corporate bank accounts are subject to an interest rate of the Euro OverNight Index Average (Eonia) + 0.5% p.a. Europay had two credit lines for a total of E65,000 available at December 31, 2001. a) A credit line for operational funding requirements amounting to E35,000 with the following interest rate conditions, which are based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor):
Straight loans for periods up to 6 months: Euribor + 0.0625% p.a. Straight loans for periods from 6 to 12 months: Euribor + 0.125%
b) A credit line amounting to E30,000 to provide fixed term financing to fund Euro D0 settlement service operations. Interest rate conditions are agreed with the bank based on the most favorable market conditions at the time the credit line is utilized. Europay had no borrowings on these credit lines at December 31, 2001 or December 31, 2000. 11. MINORITY INTEREST MasterCard has a 15% shareholding in European Payment Systems Services ("EPSS"), Europay's transaction processing subsidiary, for which a minority interest in Europay is determined as follows: 12. OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE Other amounts payable consists of the following. F-43
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) 13. LONG TERM LIABILITIES The balance of E506 at December 31, 2001 represents an invoice for a sponsorship campaign that is payable in 2003, and the balance of E244 at December 31, 2000 represents an invoice for a sponsorship campaign that is payable in 2002. 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In addition to the future lease payments summarized in Note 5, Europay has entered into sponsorship and marketing contractual obligations, which are estimated to be payable in the following years: Europay received a claim from a member alleging that an error in the technical set up of this member caused the member to incur a loss in revenues amounting to approximately E1,500. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter Europay has established a provision for the potential settlement of the claim of E739, which is included in suppliers in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001 and in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year then ended. 15. AVERAGE NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED AND PERSONNEL CHARGES Management personnel consist of the directors of Europay and all other staff are included in the employees category. In 2000 Europay provided E1,479 for obligations arising from severance agreements with employees, of which E127 is included in operating expenses and E1,353 is included in extraordinary income/(charges) in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2000. The liability for these obligations is included as part of the provisions for liabilities and charges in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2000. These obligations were settled in 2001 resulting in a use of provisions for liabilities and charges amounting to E1,353 and a charge to operating expenses for the same amount in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. F-44
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) In 2001, Europay introduced a performance-based variable pay program for all management and staff. Under this program a bonus is paid to an employee on an annual basis based on the level of achievement of targeted corporate and personal performance for the year. Europay monitors performance to corporate targets on a regular basis and accrues for the cost of the variable pay program when it is probable that the targets will be reached. Based on the 2001 corporate performance evaluation variable pay costs of E5,461 were accrued at December 31, 2001. In 2001, Europay established and began executing a comprehensive restructuring plan in order to prepare the organization and operations for the planned integration with MasterCard Incorporated described in Note 18 below. The plan provides for the involuntary termination of staff functions on specified dates over the term of the plan. Europay agreed an involuntary employee severance package for the plan with its Works Council, and communicated the package to all staff. In 2001, Europay notified all staff whose function will be terminated prior to the end of 2002 in writing that their position will be terminated as a result of the plan, including the expected termination date. Based on the terms of the involuntary employee severance package and a probability analysis of staff terminations defined in the plan to the end of 2002, Europay provided E2,742 for estimated involuntary employee severance costs. In addition, Europay provided E275 for obligations arising from separate severance agreements with employees. The liabilities for both severance provisions are included as part of the provisions for liabilities and charges in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001 and the costs are included in extraordinary income/(charges) in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year then ended. 16. TAXATION The reconciliation of the 2001, 2000 and 1999 income tax charges compared to the statutory rate of 40.17% is as follows: Included in the consolidated tax charge for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 is deferred tax amounting to E2,025 and E2,792, respectively, related to the capitalization of internally developed software, net of related amortization expense for the year. In April 1999, the Belgian tax authorities initiated an investigation of Europay's tax returns for 1997 and 1998. In June 2001, Europay received a notice from the Belgian tax authorities challenging Europay's deduction of certain card-based incentive program costs. Although Europay challenged these findings in its August 2001 response to the notice, the Belgian tax authorities reaffirmed their position in a November 2001 letter to Europay and, on December 12, 2001, Europay received a formal notice of assessment imposing an F-45
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) additional tax liability of E16,878, including penalties and interest, in connection with Europay's tax returns for 1997 and 1998. In accordance with Belgian GAAP Europay recorded a tax liability for E16,878 upon receipt of the assessment notice, which is included in taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001. Europay intends to continue to vigorously contest this matter and on February 27, 2002 filed a protest with the regional tax director in accordance with applicable administrative tax procedures. Therefore, in accordance with Belgian GAAP a receivable of E16,878 has been recorded to reflect the amount in dispute. This receivable is included in other amounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001. If Europay's deductions of such costs in 1999, 2000 and 2001 are similarly challenged, this could result in a further additional tax liability of up to approximately E16,900, including possible penalties. Interest will accrue on any additional amounts to be paid at a per annum rate of 7% until settlement. Interest on additional amounts will begin to accrue on July 1 of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the deductions to which the additional amount relates was made. In the event that Europay is unsuccessful in appealing the findings to the Belgian tax authorities in their investigation, under certain circumstances MasterCard International could, under its bylaws, levy an assessment on its European members for the additional tax liability to the extent that it, together with other losses and liabilities arising out of the representations and warranties of Europay in the draft integration agreement, exceeds $7 million in the aggregate. 17. ALLIANCE AGREEMENT WITH MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED On November 14, 1996, Europay entered into an Alliance Agreement with MasterCard pursuant to which Europay has been granted exclusive licensing rights for the MasterCard brand in Europe and is responsible for the overall management of the MasterCard brand within the European region. In accordance with this agreement: (a) Europay took over from MasterCard the billing of European members for inter-regional credit program and service transactions as from January 1, 1998 and for inter-regional debit program and service transactions as from January 1, 1999. The Consolidated Statements of Income include revenues generated from these transactions amounting to E126,878, E126,606 and E111,925 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. (b) Europay is responsible for funding MasterCard's Europe region costs plus an agreed profit margin. Total MasterCard Europe region charges of E123,460, E103,868 and E83,172 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, are included in services and other goods. (c) European members were required to migrate to a new Eurocard/MasterCard acceptance brand over the three-year period from 1997 to 1999, and MasterCard compensated the European members for their brand migration efforts through a Country Migration Fund over the same time period. Europay incurred E4,558 in advertising and marketing costs related to European members' brand migration activities in 1999. These costs are included in services and other goods in the 1999 Consolidated Statement of Income. Europay re-billed MasterCard and recorded related revenues for the full amount of these costs. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include receivables from MasterCard of E573 and E2,401 and payables to MasterCard of E4,131 and E11,955 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 18. PROPOSED INTEGRATION WITH MASTERCARD INCORPORATED Europay's shareholders are considering entering into an integration agreement with MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International that provides for MasterCard Incorporated to acquire all of Europay's capital stock in exchange for class A and class B common stock of MasterCard Incorporated (the "integration"). F-46
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) The integration is conditioned upon the merger of MasterCard International with a subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated and the exchange of existing principal and association memberships in MasterCard International for new class A membership interests in MasterCard International and shares of class A and class B common stock of MasterCard Incorporated (the "conversion"), the approval of Europay's shareholders, and other customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the conversion and integration, the European principal members of MasterCard International will own 33 1/3% of the outstanding capital stock of MasterCard Incorporated and the non-European members will own 66 2/3%. Following the completion of the conversion and integration, the Alliance Agreement between Europay and MasterCard described in Note 17 above will be terminated. As of April 17, 2002 the conversion and integration have not occurred. 19. SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BELGIUM AND UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP, which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). These differences involve methods for measuring the amounts shown in the financial statements, as well as additional disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP RECONCILING ITEMS TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. The following is a summary of the material adjustments to profit on ordinary activities after taxation and shareholders' equity that would have been required in applying the significant differences between Belgian and U.S. GAAP.

EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY MOVEMENTS IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP A summary of the principal differences and additional disclosures applicable to Europay are set out below: (a) Pensions Under Belgian GAAP, enterprises are required to make provision for their obligations relating to retirement or survivors' pensions, early-retirement and other similar pensions or allowances. However, enterprises are also bound by law to fund their pension obligations with an independent pension fund or insurance company. Consequently, the practice in Belgium is to expense as incurred the premium charged by the insurance company or pension fund, on the assumption that the amount of the premium constitutes an appropriate measure of the economic cost of their pension obligations for the period concerned. F-49
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) Under U.S. GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, which requires readjustment of the significant actuarial assumptions annually to reflect current market and economic conditions. Under SFAS No. 87, a pension asset representing the excess plan assets over benefit obligations is recognized in the balance sheet. The pension benefit obligation is calculated by using a projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains or losses within a 10% "corridor" are recognized. In addition, in cases where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the unamortized prior service cost, Europay has recorded the excess as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The net periodic pension cost under U.S. GAAP for Europay's defined benefit pension plan is as follows: COMPONENTS OF NET PERIOD BENEFIT COST Changes in the projected benefit obligation and plan assets during the year were as follows: CHANGES IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS F-50
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) The funded status under U.S. GAAP for Europay's defined benefit pension plan is as follows: FUNDED STATUS The weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension cost for Europay's defined benefit pension plan were as follows: (b) Deferred Tax Under Belgian GAAP, deferred tax liabilities on consolidation entries should be recorded when it is probable that a tax charge will effectively be incurred in the foreseeable future. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax is provided for on a full liability basis. Under the full liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry forwards at the statutory rate at each reporting date. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. (c) Capitalization of Borrowing Costs Under Belgian GAAP, an entity may choose between capitalizing or not capitalizing interest on specific borrowings to finance the construction of individual qualifying assets. Europay does not capitalize interest cost as part of the historical cost of its qualifying construction projects. Under U.S. GAAP, interest recognized on borrowings and other obligations must be capitalized for assets that are produced under a discrete project and require a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. The amount of interest eligible for capitalization is determined as either the actual cost incurred on a specific borrowing or the weighted average of the rates applicable for all the general borrowings outstanding during the period. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in each period is limited to the total amount of interest cost incurred in that period. The adjustment to net income under U.S. GAAP reflects the decrease in interest expense for the period as well as the increase in depreciation expense on the constructed assets. The adjustment to shareholders' equity under U.S. GAAP reflects the amount of interest capitalized on constructed assets, net of depreciation. F-51
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) (d) Depreciation of Fixed Assets Under Belgian GAAP, Europay depreciates its fixed assets for a full year in the year of acquisition under the straight-line basis. Further, Europay may depreciate an asset during the period of its construction or development regardless of whether the asset is substantially ready for its intended use. Prior to 1999 Europay depreciated assets during the period of construction regardless of when the asset was substantially ready for its intended use. Under U.S. GAAP, fixed assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition on a straight-line basis. Constructed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis when substantially complete. For purposes of the U.S. GAAP reconciliation, Europay has applied the half-year convention method whereby a half-year of depreciation is taken in the year of acquisition and in the year of disposal. Additionally, a constructed asset is depreciated when it is substantially ready for its intended use. (e) Internally Developed Software Costs Under Belgian GAAP, costs relating to internally developed software are capitalized when it can be demonstrated that: - The product or process is useful; - The product or process is clearly defined; - Costs related to the project are clearly identified, - The project is technically feasible; and - Financial resources are available to complete the project. Under U.S. GAAP, certain costs to develop or obtain internal-use software should be capitalized when the preliminary project stage is completed, management implicitly or explicitly authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project and it is probable that the project will be completed. Costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use that can be capitalized include external direct material and service costs, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who devote time to the internal-use computer software project and interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized costs are amortized under a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the software. (f) Financial Instruments Under Belgian GAAP, premiums paid and received on option contracts intended to reduce (hedge) foreign exchange risk on future U.S. dollar payments are deferred. Option contracts that do not qualify as risk reducing (non-hedge) are accounted for using the lower of cost or market approach. Under U.S. GAAP, gains and losses related to derivative instruments that satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged item. Upon termination of the derivative, any gains and losses are deferred and amortized to profit and loss over the remaining life of the hedged item. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses immediately included in earnings. The adjustment to net income under U.S. GAAP reflects the fact that certain contracts accounted for by Europay as hedges do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. In addition, premiums paid for hedge contracts are carried at cost by Europay, whereas they are amortized over the life of the derivative contract under U.S. GAAP. On January 1, 2001 Europay adopted hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133 Europay is required to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet by measuring these derivatives at fair value. The recognition of the change in the F-52
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. Europay recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of E547 (loss) to net income and shareholders' equity under U.S. GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2001 to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments upon adoption of SFAS 133. As discussed in Note 9, Europay had entered into forward currency hedge contracts at December 31, 2001. Under Belgian GAAP, premiums or discounts are amortized over the life of the contract. Under U.S. GAAP, the effective portion of the gain or loss of the derivative instrument is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income whereas the non-effective portion of the gain or loss is recognized currently in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2001, E5,058 has been recorded as other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the contracts. (g) Leases Under Belgian GAAP, a capital lease is deemed to exist when the sum of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than the lessor's investment in the leased asset, including related interest and other transaction costs. Under U.S. GAAP, a capital lease is deemed to exist when any of the following criteria are met: - The present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than or equal to 90% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease, or - The length of the lease period is greater than or equal to 75% of the asset's estimated useful economic life, or - The transfer of ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term, or - The existence of a bargain purchase option. The adjustment to net income under U.S. GAAP reflects a decrease in rental expense and an increase in depreciation expense related to the capitalized leased assets. The adjustment to shareholders' equity under U.S. GAAP reflects the capitalization of the net present value of the minimum lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company revised its lease term for all existing automobile contracts from 4 years to 3 1/2 years with its leasing company. Under U.S. GAAP, this modification of the lease terms effectively terminated the existing capital lease agreements. As such, any assets and liabilities will need to be removed from the balance sheet and an appropriate gain or loss will be charged to profit and loss. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, capital lease assets under U.S. GAAP with a net book value of E1,129 and a total capital lease obligation of E1,156 were removed from the balance sheet and a gain of E27 was recorded in the third quarter of 2001. Going forward, under the new lease term, the existing leases have been recorded as operating leases. (h) Capitalization of Intangible Assets Europay recognized the initial contributions to a joint venture at fair value of the assets contributed. As such, any contribution of "know-how" is recognized at fair value by both Europay and the joint venture. Further, Europay recognizes its proportionate share of expenses associated with the amortization of "know-how" recorded by the joint venture. See Note 4 for additional information. Under U.S. GAAP, initial contributions to a joint venture should generally be recorded at cost, i.e., the amount of cash contributed or net book value of non-cash assets contributed. F-53
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) (i) Financial Assets Under Belgian GAAP, Europay recorded a loss in value of an investment accounted for under the equity method. Losses must be subsequently reversed. Dividends to be received from an equity investee are accrued as income when declared. See Note 4 for additional information. Under U.S. GAAP, a loss in value of an investment, accounted for under the equity method, which is other than temporary should be recognized. Recognized losses are not subsequently reversed based on subsequent events or economic developments. Dividends from an investee accounted for under the equity method are recognized when declared as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. Europay's share of earnings or losses from equity investees is recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. (j) Licensing Fee Revenue Recognition Under Belgian GAAP, revenue from licensing fees is recognized immediately upon invoicing of customers. Under U.S. GAAP, licensing fees are earned as services are delivered and performed over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance and generally should be deferred and recognized systematically over the periods that the fees are earned. The adjustment to net income and shareholders' equity under U.S. GAAP reflects the deferral and recognition of licensing revenue over the life of the licensing arrangement for the current year. The cumulative effect adjustment to net income and shareholders' equity under U.S. GAAP reflects the cumulative adjustment, net of tax effects, related to the deferral and proportionate recognition of licensing revenue upon adoption of SAB 101. (k) Earnings Per Share Belgian GAAP does not require the presentation of earnings per share (EPS). Under U.S. GAAP, basic and diluted earnings per share must be disclosed for companies that file public reports under U.S. federal securities laws. Basic EPS is calculated as profit available to common shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. Shares issued as a result of a bonus issue are treated as if in issue for the whole year. To calculate diluted EPS, earnings are adjusted for the after-tax amount of dividends and interest recognized in the period in respect of the dilutive potential ordinary shares and for any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential on ordinary shares and for any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares. The conversion is deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the period or, if later, the date of the issue of potential ordinary shares. (l) Comprehensive Income Belgian GAAP does not require the presentation of comprehensive income. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the components of total comprehensive income in the period in which they are recognized in the financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise arising from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in shareholders' equity during the reporting period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Revenue Recognition Under Belgian GAAP, revenue earned and related cost of sales incurred while acting as an agent may be presented on a gross basis in the statement of income. F-54
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) Under U.S. GAAP, revenue and related cost of sales should be presented gross if Europay acts as a principal in the transactions and has the risk and rewards of ownership. Europay acts as an agent on behalf of MasterCard International for the billing and collection of inter-regional transactions with members. Europay does not bear the risk and rewards of ownership related to these transactions and therefore revenue and related costs should be reported net under U.S. GAAP. The impact would be a reduction in revenue of E126,878 and E126,606, net of a reduction in MasterCard costs included in services and other goods of E123,460 and E103,868 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Extraordinary Items Items classified as extraordinary under Belgian GAAP do not meet the definition of "extraordinary" under U.S. GAAP and, accordingly, are classified as operating expenses under U.S. GAAP. Cash Flow Information Under Belgian GAAP, a presentation of cash flows is considered voluntary. The statement of cash flows presented in the financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 7. This presentation is acceptable under Belgian GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP a statement of cash flows is required to be present in accordance with SFAS No. 95. Interest paid and received and dividends received are shown as operating activity cash flows, while dividends paid are shown as financing cash flows. A summary of Europay's operating, investing and financing activities, classified in accordance with U.S. GAAP is as follows: Recently Issued Accounting Standards of the United States SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") were issued in July 2001. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will be required to be implemented for accounting periods commencing as from July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, respectively. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method. SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and contains certain transitional provisions, which may affect classification of intangible assets, as well as the balance of goodwill. The ongoing impact will be that goodwill will no longer be amortized, but instead will be tested at least annually for impairment. The requirements of both statements will be applied prospectively from the effective date. Europay has assessed the impact of this new standard at January 1, 2002 and there is no impact on its financial position and results of operations. SFAS 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations", was issued in June 2001. This standard will be effective for Europay's fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2002; however, early adoption is permitted. The standard provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement cost. The standard requires that the obligation F-55
EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED) (IN E THOUSANDS) associated with the retirement of the tangible long-lived assets be capitalized into the asset cost at the time of initial recognition. The liability is then discounted to its fair value at the time of recognition using the guidance provided by the standard. Europay is assessing the impact that this new standard will have on its financial position and results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations." This statement also amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Europay is in the process of determining the effects of this statement on its business. F-56

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements combine the historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of MasterCard International and Europay and give pro forma effect to the conversion and integration. We are providing the following information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the conversion and integration. We derived this information from the separate audited financial statements of MasterCard International as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the audited financial statements of Europay as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001. The historical financial information provided for Europay was prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Europay as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, for reconciliations in euros of the historical Europay financial information prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP to the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The information is only a summary and you should read it in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus. MasterCard International's acquisition of Europay will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based upon the estimated value of the unconditional shares of MasterCard Incorporated being given in exchange for the shares of Europay on the closing date. The pro forma allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based upon management's estimates, after consultation with its advisors, of the respective fair values of Europay assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2001. However, such allocation is preliminary and is subject to the completion of the conversion and integration. Accordingly, as discussed below, the final allocation of the purchase price could differ materially from the pro forma amounts. Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill were estimated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." The purchase price in excess of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the integration that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized. At the end of the three-year transition period and on the second anniversary thereof shares of MasterCard Incorporated will be reallocated among member-stockholders. Certain member-stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated whose initial share allocations decrease will return shares to MasterCard Incorporated, which will deliver shares to member-stockholders whose initial share allocations increase. MasterCard Incorporated will not receive any net consideration for these reallocated shares, nor will there be any increase or decrease in the total amount of shares outstanding. The transaction provides that the number of shares allocated to former shareholders of Europay and MEPUK will increase or decrease at the end of the transition period as a result of the application of the global proxy formula for the third year of the transition period. See "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." In accounting for the initial purchase price of Europay, MasterCard will not consider shares above the minimum number of shares allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders at the end of the transition period because only the minimum number of shares is issued unconditionally at the closing to such shareholders. Of the 23.76 million shares attributable to the exchange of Europay and MEPUK shares, 6.15 million shares are conditional shares subject to reallocation at the end of the transition period and allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders. Europay and MEPUK shareholders are therefore receiving 17.61 million unconditional shares at closing. The value of each MasterCard Incorporated share, immediately before the exchange, is estimated to be $15.21 based on an independent appraisal. Accordingly MasterCard's purchase price for the shares of Europay is estimated to be $267.9 million. Since former Europay and MEPUK shareholders would retain or receive shares of MasterCard Incorporated at the end of the transition period without remitting any additional consideration, any shares retained or received by them that are above their minimum allocation at that time would constitute part of the 68
purchase price. Any such additional shares would be valued at that time based upon the fair value of the stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of shares to former Europay and MEPUK shareholders will increase the purchase price for Europay and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill and additional paid-in-capital recorded. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not give effect to any potential contingent consideration. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income assumes that the conversion and integration were effected on January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet assumes that the conversion and integration were effected on December 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only. No separate pro forma adjustment is required for the integration of MEPUK as it will have no assets or liabilities other than shares in Europay at the close of the transaction. You should not rely on the pro forma combined financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been consolidated or the future results that the combined company will achieve after the conversion and integration. 69

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED INCOME STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS) (1)Euro amounts are translated into U.S. dollars based on a conversion rate of 1.1172 euros per U.S. dollar, the average exchange rate between U.S. dollars and euros for the year ended December 31, 2001. (2)A reconciliation of the Europay pro forma income statement for the year ended December 31, 2001 prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP to the Europay pro forma income statement for the year ended December 31, 2001 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP as presented is provided below. Adjustments between Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP relate to the following: (a) REVENUE Reconciling items totaling $111,239 that decrease revenue recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: the elimination of revenue relating to transactions under the alliance agreement between MasterCard International and Europay, as Europay acts as MasterCard's agent rather than a principle in these transactions, of $110,507; and the deferral and amortization of licensing fee revenue required under U.S. GAAP over the term of the agreement or expected period of performance of $732. (b) GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Reconciling items totaling $118,120 that decrease general & administrative expense recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: the elimination of expense relating to transactions under the alliance agreement between MasterCard International and Europay of $110,507; adjustments required to record derivative financial instruments at fair value, relating to qualifying hedges under Belgian GAAP which are recorded under the accrual method, that do not meet the hedge documentation or effectiveness criteria under U.S. GAAP of $2,188; the reversal of rental expense due to the capitalization of leases under U.S. GAAP of $4,619; a change in accounting estimate under U.S. GAAP relating to the modification of the lease terms for all existing automobile lease contracts which effectively terminated the capital lease agreements resulting in a gain of $27; decreased expense relating to the difference between cost treatment required under U.S. GAAP and the fair value method used under Belgian GAAP for "know-how" contributed as part of initial investment equity of $416; decreased expense of $353 relating to the change during 2001 in pension benefit cost recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 87; differences in net book value of fixed assets arising from differences in depreciation methods described below resulting in an increased gain on the disposal of fixed assets of $10. 71
(c) DEPRECIATION Reconciling items totaling $4,601 that increase depreciation expense recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: depreciation of capitalized interest on borrowings and other obligations for assets under U.S. GAAP of $87; differences in depreciation methods including application of the half-year convention method under U.S. GAAP resulting in increased depreciation expense of $611; and increased depreciation expense of $3,903 related to lease agreements that are recorded as capital leases under U.S. GAAP and as operating leases under Belgian GAAP. (d) AMORTIZATION Reconciling items of $350 that increase amortization expense recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP consist of increased amortization expense as a result of internally developed software costs that are capitalized under U.S. GAAP. (e) OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE Reconciling items totaling $231 that reduce other income and expense under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: decreased interest expense of $40 due to the capitalization of interest on borrowings and other obligations for assets under U.S. GAAP; and increased interest expense on leases required to be recorded as capital leases under U.S. GAAP, net of gains recorded on the termination of capital leases under U.S. GAAP due to the revision of lease terms, of $271. (f) INCOME TAX Reconciling item of $533 that increases income tax under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP relates to the tax impact of reconciling items. (g) CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE, NET OF TAX Reconciling item of $490 represents a cumulative effect adjustment to net income to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 133/138, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". For a more detailed explanation of the nature of the Belgian GAAP to U.S. GAAP reconciling items see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Europay as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus. (3) The pro forma financial statements have been prepared to reflect the conversion of MasterCard International from a member-based organization to a stock company and the integration of Europay, MEPUK and MasterCard. No separate pro forma adjustment is required for the integration of MEPUK as it will have no assets or liabilities other than shares in Europay at the close of the transaction. Pro forma adjustments are made to reflect: (A) the elimination of inter-company revenues and expenses between MasterCard and Europay. (B) the change in annual depreciation resulting from adjustments made to the estimated useful lives of property acquired (ranging from three to thirty years). (C) additional annual amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisition consisting primarily of software and other technology-related intangibles and trademarks, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the integration that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized. (D) the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments. This is calculated using a 40% tax rate. (E) the elimination of the reduction on Europay's income statement of the minority interest in EPSS held by MasterCard. 72
(F) the consolidation of Maestro and EMV Co., entities to be under the control of the combined company. Previously, Maestro and EMV Co. were accounted for under the equity method. Europay and MasterCard each owned 50% and 33 1/3% of Maestro and EMV Co., respectively. As neither MasterCard nor Europay exercised control over Maestro or EMV Co., these investments were not consolidated prior to the integration. (G) the issuance of stock by MasterCard to its members. (H) net income attributable to European and non-European member-stockholders before and after integration with Europay (dollars in millions): -------------------- (a) The net income (pre-integration) attributable to non-European members of MasterCard is approximately 93% of MasterCard's net income and approximately 15% of Europay's net income. (b) The net income (pre-integration) attributable to European members of MasterCard is approximately 7% of MasterCard's net income and approximately 85% of Europay's net income. (c) Decreased consolidated net income is primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets. (d) Net income attributable to European and non-European member-stockholders after the integration with Europay, giving effect to possible increased share allocations to European member-stockholders at the end of the transition period: 73

Adjustments between Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP relate to the following: (a) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Reconciling items totaling $15,513 that increase property, plant and equipment recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: the capitalization of borrowing costs of $2,078; differences in depreciation methods including application of the half-year convention method under U.S. GAAP totaling $5,187; and the capitalization of capital leases of $8,248. (b) OTHER ASSETS Reconciling items totaling $7,889 that decrease other assets recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: an adjustment to net the receivable recorded under Belgian GAAP for a disputed tax assessment against the related liability of ($14,850); prepaid pension assets of $609; deferred tax assets of $2,420; adjustments to record derivative financial instruments at fair value $4,205; the difference between cost treatment required under U.S. GAAP and fair value used under Belgian GAAP of "know-how" contributed as initial investment equity of ($499); and $226 related to a loss in value on an investment accounted for under the equity method that was deemed other than temporary. 75
(c) INTANGIBLE ASSETS Reconciling items totaling $497 that increase intangible assets recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP are comprised of capitalization of internally developed software costs of $497. (d) CURRENT LIABILITIES Reconciling items totaling $12,316 that decrease current liabilities recorded under Belgian GAAP to conform with U.S. GAAP include: an adjustment to net the liability recorded under Belgian GAAP for a disputed tax assessment against the related receivable of ($14,850); adjustments to record derivative financial instruments at fair value of ($184); net present value of minimum lease obligations under capital leases of $1,754; and deferred licensing fee revenue of $964.

For a more detailed explanation of the nature of the Belgian GAAP to U.S. GAAP reconciling items see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Europay as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 included elsewhere in this proxy statement-prospectus. (3) The pro forma financial statements have been prepared to reflect the conversion of MasterCard from a member-based organization to a stock company and the integration of Europay, MEPUK and MasterCard. No separate pro forma adjustment is required for the integration of MEPUK as it will have no assets or liabilities other than shares in Europay at the close of the transaction. Pro forma adjustments are made to reflect: (A) intangible assets arising out of the preliminary allocation of purchase price as follows:
Purchase price (see Note 3(J))....................................... $267,856 Allocated as follows: Historical book value of 85% of Europay's assets and liabilities............................................ $49,347 Step-up of the fair value of assets: Software and other technology-related intangibles...... 29,878 Trademarks, tradenames and brand names................. 11,900 Property, plant and equipment.......................... 8,377 Deferred income taxes..................................... (16,063) Liabilities and acquisition related costs (see Note 3(E)).................................................. (78,898) Excess of purchase price over identifiable assets and liabilities (goodwill and customer relationships).............................. $263,315 ========
Total intangible assets amount to $305,093 and consist of customer relationships of $176,928; goodwill of $86,387; software and other technology-related intangibles of $29,878; and trademarks, tradenames and brand names of $11,900. See Note 3(C) to the Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Income Statements for amortization period. (B) the elimination of inter-company balances between MasterCard and Europay. 76
(C) the elimination of MasterCard's historical investment of $4,407 for 12.25% of Europay and 15% of EPSS (representing 15% of Europay on a consolidated basis). (D) the consolidation of Maestro International and EMV Co., entities under the control of the combined company. (E) acquisition related costs including the costs of acquiring and eliminating certain Europay brands and logos totaling $39,700; professional fees relating to the transaction totaling $12,200; severance costs for Europay employees totaling $10,000; costs of eliminating redundant European computer systems totaling $6,400; $8,000 relating to certain other acquisition liabilities; and other miscellaneous costs totaling approximately $2,600. See Note 3(A). (F) the elimination of the reduction on Europay's balance sheet of the minority interest in EPSS held by MasterCard. (G) the conversion of MasterCard International from a member-based institution to a stock corporation and the issuance of 100 million shares of class A redeemable and class B convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated at a par value of $.01 per share to the MasterCard International principal members and the Europay and MEPUK shareholders. (H) the elimination of Europay's pre-acquisition retained earnings and paid-in-capital. (I) the equity pick-up resulting from the change of MasterCard International's method of accounting for the Europay investment from historical cost to consolidation. Amount was reclassified from MasterCard International's retained earnings upon conversion. (J) an independent appraisal valued the shares of MasterCard Incorporated at $1.091 billion before the transaction. In the transaction, 66.67 million shares will be issued to non-European members and 33.33 million shares will be issued to European members. As a result of negotiations between the parties, approximately 27.96 million shares will be issued to Europay and MEPUK stockholders and 5.37 million shares will be issued to European members who are not Europay or MEPUK stockholders. Europay and MEPUK stockholders will receive 4.2 million shares for the conversion of their membership interests and the remaining 23.76 million shares are attributable to the exchange of their Europay and MEPUK shares. The transaction provides that the number of shares allocated to former shareholders of Europay and MEPUK will increase or decrease at the end of the transition period as a result of the application of the global proxy formula for the third year of the transition period. See "Share Allocation and the Global Proxy." In accounting for the initial purchase price of Europay, MasterCard will not consider shares above the minimum number of shares allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders at the end of the transition period because only the minimum number of shares is issued unconditionally at the closing to such shareholders. Of the 23.76 million shares attributable to the exchange of Europay and MEPUK shares, 6.15 million shares are conditional shares subject to reallocation at the end of the transition period and allocable to Europay and MEPUK shareholders. Europay and MEPUK shareholders are therefore receiving 17.61 million unconditional shares at closing. Immediately before the integration, the value of each MasterCard share will be approximately $15.21 based upon an independent appraisal ($1.091 billion divided by 71.71 million shares). Accordingly, MasterCard's purchase price for the shares of Europay is estimated to be $267.9 million ($15.21 per share multiplied by 17.61 million shares). Since former Europay and MEPUK shareholders would retain or receive shares of MasterCard Incorporated at the end of the transition period without remitting any additional consideration, any shares retained or received by them that are above their minimum allocation at that time would constitute part of the purchase price. Any such additional shares would be valued at that time based upon the fair value of the stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of shares to former Europay and MEPUK shareholders will increase the purchase price for Europay and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill and additional paid-in-capital recorded. 77

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): November 13, 2002 MASTERCARD INCORPORATED (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) DELAWARE - 13-4172551 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of incorporation) File Number) Identification No.) 2000 PURCHASE STREET PURCHASE, NEW YORK 10577 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (914) 249-2000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) NOT APPLICABLE (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. On November 13, 2002, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, issued a press release announcing performance results for its payment programs for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002 (the "Release"). The Release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. The tables below provide further information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002. In addition, included below are tables that provide further information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002. The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns are derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns are derived from information provided by MasterCard members and certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the tables is estimated. In addition, a portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Certain information in the preceding tables has been the subject of prior public release by MasterCard. The information in the preceding tables relating to the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 has been restated to conform to the presentation of information in the tables for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002 and to reflect revisions to certain historical statistical information provided by MasterCard's members subsequent to the previous release of this information by MasterCard. The Release may contain other information relating to the performance of MasterCard's payment programs not described in the tables. Among other things, the Release describes the total number of acceptance locations where MasterCard-branded cards may be used by cardholders. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, automated teller machines and other locations where cash may be obtained using a MasterCard-branded card. In certain countries, merchant locations include data relating to all acceptance terminals deployed at individual merchants.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

"Although most economies around the world remained weak during the year, MasterCard continues to see strong growth in all aspects of our payment programs," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard's president and CEO. "These results demonstrate the continued progress our payment solutions are making against cash and checks as consumers and merchants around the world increasingly recognize the convenient and secure options we offer." In addition, Selander attributed MasterCard's success to the company's strategic focus on providing exceptional customer service and technological capabilities, unsurpassed acceptance, and customized payments solutions for its member financial institutions around the globe. "Our growth continues to reflect that more and more often, our members and their customers are turning to MasterCard as their payment brand of choice." Highlights of the first nine months of 2002 include: - - Cardholders around the globe used MasterCard(R)-branded cards (excluding Cirrus(R) and Maestro(R) online debit activity) for more than 9.84 billion purchase and cash transactions in the first nine months of 2002, generating gross dollar volume (GDV) of $831.7 billion, an increase of 16.1% over the same period in 2001. Third quarter 2002 purchase and cash transactions reached 3.50 billion, generating GDV of $296 billion, a 16.5% gain over third quarter 2001; - - As of September 30, 2002, MasterCard's 25,000 member financial institutions around the world had issued nearly 578.8 million MasterCard-branded cards, a 15.6 % increase over September 30, 2001. These cards could be used at 29.6 million acceptance locations around the world; - - The value of purchases on MasterCard cards, a significant measure of success, continued to show substantial gains. Globally, purchase volume (excluding cash transactions) rose 14.4% to $580.3 billion for the first nine months of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. During the first nine months of 2002, MasterCard-branded cards were used for 8.59 billion purchase transactions. Purchase volume was $207.8 billion in the third quarter of 2002, a 16.1% increase from the 2001 period, with 3.07 billion transactions recorded. -more-
MasterCard International - Page 2 MasterCard Reports Strong Growth in Its Payment Programs For Third Quarter, First Nine Months of 2002 November 13, 2002 MasterCard's strong growth in the first nine months of 2002 was fueled by growth in both credit and debit programs. GDV for worldwide MasterCard credit programs grew 15.1% to $690.6 billion, and GDV for MasterCard off-line debit programs rose 21.6% to $141.1 billion, in each case compared to the first nine months of 2001. STRONG REGIONAL RESULTS Strong MasterCard-branded GDV growth was reported for all regions, with each reporting double-digit gains in the first nine months of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001: the U.S. rose 17.8%; Europe, 13.6%; Asia/Pacific, 12.7%; Latin America, 26.3%; South Asia, Middle East/Africa, 23.1%; and Canada, 19.8%. In the United States, which accounts for more than half of total GDV, MasterCard-branded cards were used in almost five billion purchase and cash transactions in the first nine months of 2002, generating $439.7 billion in GDV, a 17.8% GDV increase over the same period in 2001.

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2002 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2002. The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns are derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns are derived from information provided by MasterCard members and certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the tables is estimated. In addition, a portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Certain information in the preceding tables has been the subject of prior public release by MasterCard. The information in the preceding tables for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 has been restated to conform to the presentation of information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2002 and to reflect revisions to certain historical statistical information provided by MasterCard's members subsequent to the previous release of this information by MasterCard.

Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. Based on information provided by MasterCard members and other sources, we estimate that, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 458 million and 413 million cards worldwide, respectively. The preceding figures reflect revisions to the number of cards bearing the Maestro brand mark previously reported by MasterCard in its SEC filings, in order to reclassify certain on-line debit cards that do not have point-of-sale debit functionality.

The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Certain information in the preceding tables has been the subject of prior public release by MasterCard. The information in the preceding tables for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 has been restated to conform to the presentation of information in the tables for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and to reflect revisions to certain historical statistical information provided by MasterCard's members subsequent to the previous release of this information by MasterCard. Among other adjustments, the number of cards has been adjusted for all periods to reflect a change in reporting methodology by a U.S. member. Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated May 3, 2004, which further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three months ended March 31, 2004.

Reflecting improving global economic activity, total purchases on MasterCard credit and debit cards rose 13.6% in the first quarter, with each region reporting double-digit growth. "The year is getting off to a strong start for both MasterCard and our customers," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard President and CEO. "We have seen an increase in worldwide purchase growth in every region, reflecting the improving global economy. Compared to the same period in 2003, all regions of MasterCard experienced double-digit growth in purchases, including Asia/Pacific, which is turning around after a challenging year in 2003." Performance highlights for the first three months of 2004, in addition to purchase volume, include: o Cardholders across the globe used MasterCard-branded cards (excluding Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R)) for over 3.7 billion transactions, generating gross dollar volume (GDV) of $331.9 billion, an increase of 8.4% over the same period in 2003. GDV includes both purchase and cash volume; o MasterCard's almost 25,000 customer financial institutions around the world had issued more than 627.5 million MasterCard-branded cards, a 6.6% increase over first quarter 2003. MasterCard's strong growth in the first three months of 2004 was fueled by growth in both credit and debit programs. GDV for worldwide credit and charge programs grew 8.9% to $270.1 billion, and GDV for offline debit programs rose 6.7% to $61.7 billion over the same period in 2003.

MasterCard will work with ABN AMRO to develop their existing payment card business and will support their entry into new markets; o MasterCard Advisors' acquisition of Tower Group, the leading research and advisory firm focused on the global financial services industry, significantly strengthened our independent advisory research unit, Purchase Street Research. MasterCard Advisors is a global professional services organization, offering consulting, research, outsourcing and information products and services. o British Airways became the first global airline to offer MasterCard(R) SecureCode(TM) across multiple regions, with a roll-out to 23 country sites, including the United Kingdom and United States.

The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded and MasterCard Electronic(TM)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.

Total purchases on MasterCard credit and offline debit cards rose 11.7% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2003, and the number of MasterCard cards issued around the world rose to 638.3 million. "The first half of this year has been successful for both MasterCard and our customers," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard President and CEO. "Many of the issues that limited economic growth last year are behind us, and we've seen stronger purchase activity across our global network as more confident consumers increased spending. Also this quarter, our Asia/Pacific region reported growth in gross dollar volume (GDV) up for the first time in 18 months reflecting renewed consumer confidence in the region." Performance highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2004 include: - Cardholders across the globe used MasterCard-branded cards for almost 4.1 billion transactions, generating GDV of $349.0 billion in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 9.2% over the same period in 2003.

MasterCard International-Page 3 MasterCard International Reports Continued Growth For Second Quarter, First Six Months of 2004 August 2, 2004 SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES ACHIEVED MasterCard also achieved a wide range of significant business milestones in the first half of 2004: - MasterCard announced an initiative to attack "phishing" before it happens. MasterCard will work with NameProtect, a leading digital fraud detection company, to identify sites established to steal personal information. These sites are often used to launch phishing attacks via email that can ultimately result in identity theft. In addition, MasterCard and NameProtect will identify sites that broker illegally-obtained payment card numbers. NameProtect's technology will identify online scams in real-time, globally, by searching domain names, web pages, chat rooms, and more. MasterCard will send out rapid alerts to members when their accounts are identified as being at risk, and notify authorities of potential compromises. - MasterCard signature debit cards were again accepted at all Wal-Mart store locations in the U.S., underscoring a significant win for MasterCard cardholders in giving them as much choice in payments as possible. In addition to MasterCard signature debit cards, Wal-Mart will continue to accept all other MasterCard payment products, including credit, PIN debit, and corporate cards. - McDonald's(R) joined with MasterCard to provide MasterCard cardholders with cashless payment options at more than 3,000 McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. Cashless payments include credit cards and PIN and signature-debit card payments. McDonald's expects the number of participating restaurants to more than double by year-end. - MasterCard Advisors(TM), the professional services arm of MasterCard International, announced the acquisition of consulting firm Watch Hill Partners, which specializes in optimization of customer relationships through multiple channels and technologies. MasterCard Advisors also announced the launch of a new Web-based financial tool, PurchaseLogic, which gives corporations a transparent view of their entire procure-to-pay process. - MasterCard announced that a number of the world's leading smart card vendors signed its M/Chip(TM) 4 Development Agreement and are actively developing products in support of M/Chip 4 for 2004 availability. M/Chip 4 is at the core of MasterCard's smart card strategy and represents the latest generation of EMV payment applications.

Cardholders worldwide used MasterCard-branded cards (excluding Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R)) for 4.3 billion transactions, generating GDV of $365.9 billion in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 10.0% over the same period in 2003. Total purchases on MasterCard credit and offline debit cards increased 11.1% for the three months ending September 30, 2004, as the number of MasterCard cards issued worldwide rose to 656.0 million. "The third quarter of this year provides further evidence of the continued success of MasterCard and our customers," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard President and CEO. "Even as macroeconomic factors such as higher fuel prices and sporadic job growth have dampened consumer spending, we continue to see strong purchase activity across our global network. This quarter we saw double-digit purchase volume growth in most areas of the world, reflective of the global power of our brand, the strength of our business partnerships, and the continued migration away from cash and check towards our wide range of payment solutions."

The technology will allow cardholders to make purchases at participating McDonald's restaurants without swiping their card through a traditional card-reader. - MasterCard implemented a range of new initiatives aimed at providing merchants with new tools that will help them maximize the benefits and value of accepting MasterCard payment cards. This included the launch of MasterCardmerchant.com, a website for the merchant community that provides information about MasterCard acceptance programs and insight into how to most effectively leverage card acceptance. MasterCard also published a new manual to provide merchants with MasterCard rules and procedures, which can be downloaded free of charge from the MasterCard merchant website. - MasterCard launched new print advertising executions as part of the brand's successful "Priceless" advertising campaign. For the first time, MasterCard advertising features national merchants as part of the brand's "Priceless" positioning and offers a dynamic new style and layout. The ads focus on several high-profile national merchants, including Banana Republic, The Gap, Kmart, Pier 1, Travelocity, RadioShack, Shell and Williams-Sonoma. - MasterCard will jointly launch Industrial Bank's first MasterCard dual-currency international credit card through China UnionPay. The card, called Industrial Card, marks an important milestone for Industrial Bank in its drive to enter the international market. Industrial Bank has 260 branches in almost all major domestic cities across China. - more -

The data in this press release is provided by the member financial institutions of MasterCard International Incorporated and its affiliates ("MasterCard") and is subject to revision and amendment by such members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data relating to accounts and cards reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. Information with respect to gross dollar volumes ("GDV") includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. Period-over-period rates of change in volume-based information are provided on a local-currency basis. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change in this press release cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to the U.S. dollar volume information presented for the current and historical periods. MasterCard-branded data regarding GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. MasterCard-branded data concerning accounts, cards and acceptance locations is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. Cash volume growth for offline debit programs in the U.S. region has increased significantly as a result of stricter enforcement of reporting requirements for certain transactions not processed by MasterCard. The data in this press release includes information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Accordingly, the data in this press release cannot be taken as an indication of the financial performance of MasterCard International or its parent company, MasterCard Incorporated. - more -

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On November 17, 2004, MasterCard International Incorporated, the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, amended the terms of its Value Appreciation Program ("VAP"). The VAP is a long-term incentive plan which from 1995 through 1998 awarded share units, each representing the return on $1,000 invested in a portfolio consisting of the publicly-traded stock of some of the Company's member financial institutions, to certain of MasterCard's senior executives. Generally, share units vest ratably over a five-year period and vest automatically upon a VAP participant's termination of employment due to death, disability or retirement. Share units are automatically forfeited in the event that a participant is terminated for cause. VAP participants have ten years from the date of the award to exercise their share units. Upon exercising their share units, participants receive the appreciated value of the investment -- a cash payment equal to the difference between the current market value of the share unit and the original amount of the investment. Upon expiration of a share unit, the share unit is automatically exercised and paid out to the participant. The amendments to the VAP, which are effective October 1, 2004, permit the assets underlying the share units to be invested in investment funds instead of the portfolio of the stock of MasterCard's members. The amendments also provide participants with more flexibility regarding when they can exercise their units and clarify some administrative features of the VAP. ITEM 5.02. DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. On November 18, 2004, the Global Board of Directors of MasterCard Incorporated elected Donald L. Boudreau to become a full voting director of the Global Board, representing the U.S. region. Mr. Boudreau fills a vacancy on the Global Board that arose in connection with the resignation of another director in May 2004. Mr. Boudreau is Chairman Emeritus of MasterCard Incorporated and has served on the Global Board as a non-voting advisory director since June 2002. Mr. Boudreau is a member of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of the Global Board. Mr. Boudreau is a former executive officer of Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A., which is a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated and a principal member of MasterCard International Incorporated. MasterCard provides financial and other incentives to Chase and its affiliates in connection with MasterCard-branded payment programs issued by Chase. MasterCard earned approximately $153 million in net fees from Chase and its affiliates in 2003. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits.

SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. MASTERCARD INCORPORATED By /s/ Noah J. Hanft -------------------------------------- Noah J. Hanft Date: November 19, 2004 General Counsel and Secretary

Exhibit 99.1 MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED VALUE APPRECIATION PROGRAM 1. PURPOSE This Value Appreciation Program ("Program") is designed to support the strategic commitment to attract, retain and motivate senior executives of MasterCard International Incorporated (the "Company") by providing a long-term incentive opportunity that is performance-driven, market-based, and linked to member profitability. 2. ELIGIBILITY Employees who are designated Senior Vice President are eligible for participation in any plan year provided they were designated a Senior Vice President by January 1 of that year. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer may designate any other senior executive to participate in the Program. 3. PARTICIPATION Participation in the Program shall be limited to senior executives of the Company who are designated in writing by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Global Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company to be participants ("Participants") in the Program. 4. SHARE UNIT AWARDS (a) Subject to the provisions of this Program, the Committee may at any time, or from time to time, award share units ("Share Units") to Participants. Upon the exercise or deemed exercise of Share Units in accordance with the provisions of this Program, a Participant shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, for each Share Unit exercised, equal to the excess (if any) of the value of such Share Unit (the "Unit Value") as of the date of exercise over the Unit Value as of the date of grant of Share Units. Unit Value shall be determined in accordance with Section 5. (b) The Committee shall specify the terms and conditions of each award of Share Units. Each such award shall be evidenced by a certificate or written agreement in a form approved by the Committee. The Committee may condition the grant of a new award on the surrender of an outstanding award. Any such new award shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified by the Committee at the time the new award is granted, in accordance with the provisions of the Program and without regard to the terms of the surrendered award. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 1
5. UNIT VALUE (a) For purposes of this Program, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: (i) "Account" shall mean an investment management or other account established to hold securities, cash and any other assets of the Program. (ii) "Administrative Committee" shall mean a committee comprised of at least three company officers appointed by the Committee to perform day-to-day administrative functions pursuant to the terms of the Program. (b) The Unit Value of a Share Unit as of a given date shall be based on the market value of specific securities or other assets that are representative of the financial services industry, as selected by the Committee. Such market value shall be determined in accordance with procedures approved by the Administrative Committee. Cash dividends and investment management expenses shall not be taken into account in determining the Unit Value of the specified financial services securities or other assets. The Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the treatment of all other items. 6. VESTING (a) An award of Share Units shall vest according to the following schedule if the Participant remains in the continuous employment of the Company ("Employment"): Except as otherwise determined by the Committee or as provided in Section 6(b), unvested Share Units shall be forfeited upon termination of employment. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Participant's termination of employment due to death, Disability or Retirement, all of the Participant's - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 2
Share Units shall immediately vest and none shall be forfeited. For purposes of this Program: "Retirement" shall mean retirement after age 65, after age 60 with at least five years of "service", or after age 55 with at least 10 years of "service," with the term "service" defined as it is for purposes of the MasterCard International Incorporated Pension Plan; and "Disability" shall mean total and permanent disability in accordance with the Company's long-term disability plan. (c) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Program to the contrary, all Share Units held by a Participant shall be forfeited in full, without any right to payment from the Company, upon the Participant's termination of employment for "Cause". "Cause" means (i) the willful failure by the Participant to substantially perform his duties as an employee of the Company (other than due to physical or mental illness) after reasonable notice to the Participant of such failure, (ii) the Participant's engaging in serious misconduct that is injurious to the Company including, but not limited to, damage to its reputation or standing in its industry, (iii) the Participant's having been convicted of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to a crime that constitutes a felony or (iv) the material breach by the Participant of any written covenant or agreement with the Company not to disclose any information pertaining to the Company. Whether a termination was for "Cause" shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 7. EXERCISE (a) An award of Share Units may only be exercised to the extent it is vested pursuant to Section 6. Thereafter, subject to the provisions of Section 6 and this Section 7, and any rules which may be specified by the Committee regarding the time and manner of exercising Share Units, Share Units may be exercised by a Participant at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part. (b) Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, an award of Share Units shall expire at the close of business on the earliest of: (i) The tenth anniversary of the date of grant of the Share Units; (ii) The last business day of the month following the month of the Participant's termination of employment for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or Cause; (iii) The Participant's termination of employment for Cause. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 3
(c) All vested Share Units that remain outstanding upon the expiration of an award pursuant to Section 7(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall, to the extent they have value, be deemed to have been automatically exercised at the time of expiration, and the Participant holding the Share Units shall receive payment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8. (d) Share Units may be exercised by notice to the Administrative Committee, made in the form and manner prescribed by the Administrative Committee, specifying the number of Share Units to be exercised. An exercise is treated as occurring on receipt in the prescribed form by the Company or its designee under procedures established by the Administrative Committee. Share Units must be exercised for a whole number of Share Units, and the minimum number of Share Units that may be exercised at any one time is the smaller of 10% of the combined total number of Share Units originally awarded under all grants or 100% of the combined total Share Units then remaining under all grants. Upon exercise, the number of Share Units exercised shall terminate and the Participant shall have no further rights with regard to the terminated Share Units. (e) Share Units shall be exercisable only by the Participant to whom they are granted, or upon the Participant's death, by his beneficiary (designated by the Participant in accordance with such procedures as the Administrative Committee may specify) or, in the absence of a surviving beneficiary, his estate or legal representative. Rights granted under the Program are not otherwise assignable and are not subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution or levy of any kind. 8. PAYMENT Following the exercise of Share Units under Section 7(a) or the deemed exercise of Share Units under Section 7(c), the Participant shall receive payment in an amount determined pursuant to Sections 4 and 5(b). Payment of such amount shall be made in cash in a single installment as soon as practicable after exercise and valuation of the Share Units. 9. TERM The Plan shall be effective as of April 1, 1995. No Share Units shall be granted under the Plan after March 31, 2005, but the Program shall continue in effect thereafter with respect to previously granted Share Units. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 4
10. CUSTODY OF PROGRAM ASSETS The Company, in its discretion, may establish an Account to accumulate funds to offset its obligations under this Program. The Company, through its Treasury Department, shall have authority to establish an Account to hold securities, cash, or other assets for purposes of this Program, and shall have authority to trade (including through a broker) in the assets in the Account. The assets of the Account shall be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's bankruptcy or insolvency. 11. ADMINISTRATION (a) All resolutions or actions taken by the Committee shall be by affirmative vote or action of a majority of the members of the Committee. (b) The Committee shall appoint an Administrative Committee comprised of at least three officers of the Company. The Committee may, at any time, remove any member of the Administrative Committee and appoint a replacement member. (c) Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the members of the Committee and Administrative Committee shall serve without compensation for service as such, but all reasonable expenses incurred in the administration of the Program shall be paid by the Company. (d) The Administrative Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, any question arising in connection with the interpretation or application of the provisions of the Program and its decisions or actions in respect thereof shall be conclusive and binding upon any and all Participants and their beneficiaries, successors and assigns, and all other persons. The Administrative Committee shall determine the amounts of benefits to be paid in accordance with the terms of the Program, including the Unit Value of Share Units, and shall authorize and direct disbursements in accordance with its determination. The determination of the Administrative Committee of the amounts of benefits to be paid to any Participant shall be subject to review by the Committee, and the Committee's determination following any such review shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and all Participants and their beneficiaries, successors and assigns. The Administrative Committee may appoint an investment manager to manage the assets of the Account consistent with the terms of the Program, and the Administrative Committee may replace the investment manager at any time in its sole discretion. In addition, the Administrative Committee may appoint a record keeper to perform the record keeping functions for the Plan and may replace such record keeper at any time in its sole discretion. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 5
(e) Members of the Committee and Administrative Committee shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the advice of counsel and shall incur no liability with respect to the Program except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties. The Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and Administrative Committee against any and all claims, liabilities and costs (including attorney fees) arising in connection with their administration of the Program except for such member's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS (a) Nothing in this Program or in any instrument executed pursuant hereto shall confer upon any person any right to continue in the employment or other service of the Company, or shall affect the right of the Company to terminate the employment or other service of any person at any time with or without cause. (b) The grant of Share Units shall not confer upon a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any of its member companies, and no shares of stock shall be issued pursuant to Share Units. The rights of a Participant under the Program shall be no greater than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company, and no Participant shall have any claim against or rights to the securities, cash, or other assets held in the Account. (c) In the event a Participant is employed or resides in a country with laws that prescribe certain requirements for long-term incentives to qualify for advantageous tax treatment, the Committee may in its discretion modify the terms of an award to be made under the Program and procure assumption of any of the Company's obligations hereunder by an affiliate company, in a manner consistent or inconsistent with the terms of the Program, for the purpose of qualifying the award under such laws of such country; provided, however, that to the extent possible, the overall terms and conditions of such an award should not be more favorable to the recipient than would be permitted if the award had been granted under this Program as herein set forth. (d) Participants shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes due in connection with the Program; provided, however, that the Company shall make such provisions as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which the Company determines it is required to withhold in connection with any award under the Program. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 6
(e) By accepting any benefits under the Program, each Participant, and each person claiming under or through him, shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated his acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all provisions of the Program and any action or decision under the Program by the Company, its agents and employees, the Committee, and the Administrative Committee. (f) The validity, construction, interpretation and administration of the Program and any awards under the Program and of any determinations or decisions made thereunder, and the rights of all persons having or claiming to have any interest herein or thereunder, shall be governed by, and determined exclusively in accordance with, the laws of New York. (g) This Program shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its affiliated companies and their successors or assigns, and all Participants and their beneficiaries, successors, and assigns and all other persons claiming under or through any of them. (h) The value of Share Unit Awards shall not be treated as compensation and/or salary for purposes of calculating a Participant's benefits under any of the Company's other benefit plans, policies or programs. (i) The use of the masculine gender shall also include within its meaning the feminine. The use of the singular shall include within its meaning the plural and vice versa. 13. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION This Program may be amended or terminated by the Board at any time, for any reason and in any respect; provided, however, that no such amendment or termination of this Program shall affect adversely any award of Share Units theretofore granted without the written consent of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) The methodology for determining Unit Value may be changed, on a prospective basis, at any time. (b) Upon termination of the Program, the Board may provide for the immediate termination of all outstanding Share Units in exchange for a cash payment equal to the then value of the Share Units that are outstanding and vested (pursuant to Section 6) at the time of termination. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Valuation Appreciation Program Plan Document - 7

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On November 23, 2004, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, and UMB Bank & Trust, N.A., as indenture trustee for the 7.36% Series A Senior Secured Notes (the "notes"), amended the terms of MasterCard International's guarantee in connection with the notes by transferring certain obligations from MasterCard International to MasterCard Incorporated. The notes were issued in August 1999 by MasterCard International O'Fallon 1999 Trust, a consolidated variable interest entity, to finance MasterCard's global technology and operations facility in O'Fallon Missouri. As a result of the amendment to the guarantee, MasterCard Incorporated has become a party to the guarantee and has assumed certain covenant compliance obligations, including financial reporting and maintenance of consolidated net worth. The amendment to the guarantee aligns MasterCard's financial reporting and net worth covenant obligations under the guarantee with similar obligations under its other debt instruments. MasterCard entered into the amendment to the guarantee to better reflect MasterCard's corporate structure and to reduce the costs and administrative burden of complying with different debt covenants.

Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004. The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded and MasterCard Electronic(TM)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Cash volume growth for offline debit programs in the U.S. region has increased significantly as a result of stricter enforcement of reporting requirements for such data. Certain information in the preceding tables has been the subject of prior public release by MasterCard. The information in the preceding tables for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 has been restated to conform to the presentation of information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004 and to reflect revisions to certain historical statistical information provided by MasterCard's members subsequent to the previous release of this information by MasterCard. Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated February 2, 2005, which further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004.

The data in this press release is provided by the member financial institutions of MasterCard International Incorporated and its affiliates ("MasterCard") and is subject to revision and amendment by such members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data relating to accounts and cards reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. Information with respect to gross dollar volumes ("GDV") includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. Period-over-period rates of change in volume-based information are provided on a local-currency basis. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change in this press release cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to the U.S. dollar volume information presented for the current and historical periods. MasterCard-branded data regarding GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. MasterCard-branded data concerning accounts, cards and acceptance locations is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. Cash volume growth for offline debit programs in the U.S. region has increased significantly as a result of stricter enforcement of reporting requirements for certain transactions not processed by MasterCard. The data in this press release includes information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Accordingly, the data in this press release cannot be taken as an indication of the financial performance of MasterCard International or its parent company, MasterCard Incorporated.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On June 17, 2005, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, entered into a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with Citibank N.A. ("Citibank"), as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. ("JPMorgan Chase"), as back-up administrative agent, HSBC Bank USA, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and Royal Bank of Scotland, each as co-syndication agents, and certain other financial institutions. The Credit Facility, which expires on June 16, 2006, replaced MasterCard Incorporated's prior $1.95 billion credit facility which expired on June 17, 2005. Borrowings under the facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points or an alternative base rate. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on MasterCard's credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Based on a Schedule 13G/A Information Statement filed on February 11, 2005, Citibank and its affiliates own approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates own approximately 11.7% of the outstanding shares of common stock of MasterCard Incorporated based on a Schedule 13G/A filed on February 10, 2005.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005.
     The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
 
     Maestro and Cirrus on-line debit transactions, Mondex transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables.
     For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
     The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.
     Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods.
     The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial
 
cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release.
     A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
     The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Cash volumes for the periods indicated in the tables above for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region are higher due to expanded data collection and stricter enforcement of reporting requirements during these periods. Some of the data in the Asia/Pacific region for the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2004 has been estimated in order to conform to current presentation standards and ensure comparable statistics. Estimates were not used for periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2003, consequently growth rates for the Asia/Pacific region and worldwide for the year ended December 31, 2003 are higher than previously reported. In addition, a change in methodology for characterizing volumes for certain transactions in China and the United Kingdom has lowered purchase volume and increased cash volume in the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions.
Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated August 2, 2005, which further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005.

 MasterCard International today announced excellent operating results for the second quarter and first six months of 2005, as double-digit growth in both gross dollar volume (GDV) and purchase volume was fueled by increased cardholder spending around the world and the continued implementation of the company's successful customer-centric strategy.

Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005.
 
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
 
 
 
Maestro and Cirrus on-line debit transactions, Mondex transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables.
 
For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
 
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.
 
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to U.S. dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release which revisions and amendments may be material.
 
A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
 
The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues. Accordingly, the data in the tables cannot be taken as a direct indication of the financial performance of MasterCard. Cash volumes for the periods indicated in the tables above for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region are higher due to expanded data collection and stricter enforcement of reporting requirements during these periods. Some of the data in the Asia/Pacific region for the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2004 have been estimated in order to conform to current presentation standards and ensure comparable statistics. In addition, a change in methodology for characterizing volumes for certain transactions in China and the United Kingdom have lowered purchase volume and increased cash volume in the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions.
 
Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated February 2, 2006 that further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005 which exhibit is furnished and not filed herewith.

This press release contains forward-looking information. Although MasterCard believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its objectives will be achieved.

On February 16, 2006, MasterCard Incorporated commenced the distribution to its shareholders of two letters, each dated February 16, 2006, one from Baldomero Falcones, Chairman, and one from Robert W. Selander, President and Chief Executive Officer. The two letters are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
February 16, 2006
Dear MasterCard Shareholder,
Please find enclosed a letter from Bob Selander, the Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard.
As you will see from the letter, we have been making excellent progress in the implementation of our new governance and ownership structure. However, as Bob explains, he has an unexpected health matter to address that will mean a delay in our timelines. We now expect to complete our transition to a new structure in the second quarter of 2006.
Let me take this opportunity to express the Board's full support and appreciation for Bob and his management team. I expect Bob to make a full recovery and look forward to continuing to work with him in implementing our new structure, bringing value to our customers and delivering excellent business results.
 
Regards,
 
Baldomero Falcones
Chairman
Enclosure

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Dear MasterCard Shareholder,
I want to update you on our progress with the implementation of our new governance and ownership structure.
Since Baldo Falcones and I wrote to you in August 2005, I am pleased to report that we have made excellent progress. As you know, we presented our proposals to you for approval in November 2005 and received your overwhelming support. Since then, we have made progress on all aspects of the transition including identifying our first independent directors and forming a new MasterCard charitable foundation. Overall, we were on track to complete the transition to our new governance and ownership structure in the first quarter of 2006.
In the midst of this smooth progress, I received some personal news that I want to share with you, and which we expect will delay our transition to a new structure until the second quarter of 2006. I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, which many of you probably know is a particularly common form of cancer among men over the age of 50. I was fortunate to have been diagnosed at an early stage when the prospects for a full recovery are excellent.
This week, I underwent surgery and I am delighted to inform you that the operation was successful. I am already at home and my prognosis is excellent. I will work from home over the next couple of weeks, with strong support from a highly experienced management team. I expect to be back in the office in early March.
While I have already resumed my normal responsibilities, I have been advised not to undertake a demanding travel schedule, such as a road show, over the next couple of months. We expect that this, combined with the timelines for our first quarter results, will mean a delay in our transition to a new structure until the second quarter of 2006.
As Baldo and I mentioned in our previous letter to you, the new structure will mark the start of a new chapter in MasterCard's history. I am personally looking forward to leading us there, to bringing even greater value to our customers and to delivering excellent business results.
The management team and I appreciate and thank the Board for its full support.
 
Regards,
Bob Selander
President and Chief Executive Officer

On August 2, 2006, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2006.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
In the attached press release, the Company discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the attached press release. While MasterCard's management believes that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating MasterCard's operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
On August 2, 2006, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2006 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced performance for the second quarter of 2006. The company reported net income of $101 million, or $0.74 per share, excluding special items, and a net loss of $310 million, or $2.30 per share, including special items.
Purchase, NY, August 2, 2006
Net revenue for the quarter was $846 million, a 9.7% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on revenue growth for the quarter.
Fueling the higher revenue in the second quarter was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 16.4%, on a local currency basis, to $485 billion; a 17.7% increase in the number of transactions processed; and a restructuring of cross-border transaction fees which was implemented in April 2006. Worldwide purchase volume rose 17.5%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $351 billion driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As expected, significant rebates and incentives in the quarter, which included a large debit portfolio conversion from a competitive brand, partially offset gross revenue growth. As of June 30, 2006, the company's customer banks had issued 796 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 11.2% percent over the same period in 2005.
Special items for the quarter included:
 
 
 
The company's net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.

"Our solid operational performance for the quarter demonstrates that through our strengths as a franchisor, processor and advisor, we are successfully delivering on our commitment to bring our customers innovative products and value-added services to help them enhance the profitability of their payments businesses," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer.
"Our customers around the world are increasingly recognizing MasterCard as their brand of choice because of the strength of our unified global organization, advanced transaction processing network, powerful brand and our ability to provide them with unique payment solutions," he said. "This quarter's strong performance in emerging markets such as our Latin America and South Asia/Middle East Africa regions illustrates our ability to displace paper-based forms of payment by bringing the benefits of electronic payments to every corner of the world."
Total operating expenses increased 93.4%, to $1.1 billion, during the quarter compared to the same period in 2005. This increase was primarily driven by the contributions to the MasterCard Foundation, an increase in advertising and market development expenses related to the sponsorship of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and an increase in personnel expenses to support the company's strategic initiatives. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on expense growth for the quarter.
Total other income/(expense) was $13 million in the second quarter 2006 versus ($5) million in last year's second quarter. The increase was driven by interest income from higher cash balances related to proceeds received from the IPO, as well as increases in interest rates and dividends received.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the share donation to the MasterCard Foundation. Excluding the impact of the share donation, the effective tax rate would have been 33.6% and 34.0%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, down from the comparable periods in 2005. The rates in 2006 were lower than 2005 primarily due to favorable tax audit developments and the tax benefit related to qualified domestic production activities as allowed under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the share donation, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Commenting on the company's financial performance, Chris A. McWilton, MasterCard's chief financial officer, noted that "During the second quarter, MasterCard continued to deliver solid revenue growth and good operating margins reflecting our globally competitive business model. Our capital position remains strong with $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities."

Year-to-Date 2006 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, MasterCard reported net income of $227 million, or $1.68 per share, excluding the impact of the special items described above. Including the impact of the special items, the company reported a net loss of $184 million, or $1.36 per share.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $1.6 billion, a 10.8% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted this growth by approximately 1%.
Total operating expenses increased 54.3%, to $1.7 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations reduced this growth by approximately 1% in the year-to-date period.
Total other income/(expense) was $24 million for the six-month period versus ($12) million for the same period in 2005. This change was driven by a $26 million increase in investment income, including the $7 million special item earned on IPO proceeds. Interest expense also decreased by $8 million due to a refund of interest assessed in connection with an audit of the company's federal income tax return and a reduction of interest reserve requirements related to the company's tax reserves.

Footnote
Set forth above is information regarding the performance results for the three month period ended June 30, 2006 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated.
The table sets forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus -branded cards, Mondex transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made (including PIN point-of-sale) with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN).
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release.
Volumes for the period indicated in the table above for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region are higher due to expanded data collection of PIN point-of-sale volumes.
A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
The table includes information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On September 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") elected Richard Haythornthwaite as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Steven J. Freiberg as a Class M director, or one of three directors elected by financial institutions that are holders of the Company's Class M common stock. Mr. Freiberg does not currently serve on any committees of the Board. Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release announcing these elections.
Mr. Freiberg is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup's Global Consumer Group NA and Co-Chair of Citigroup's Global Consumer Group. As previously reported by the Company in its June 16, 2006 proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as required pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, affiliates of Citigroup are members of MasterCard International Incorporated and have entered into agreements with MasterCard International Incorporated in connection with, among other things, their payment programs. As of June 12, 2006, Citigroup and its affiliates had approximately 8.98% of the total voting power of the Company's Class M common stock. For the full year 2005, the Company earned approximately $244 million in net revenues from Citigroup and its affiliates and paid Citigroup and its affiliates approximately $1 million for treasury and other related services.
Pursuant to the terms of Section 6.1 of the Company's 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan, on September 14, 2006, Mr. Haythornthwaite and Mr. Freiberg received 1,071 and 1,345 MasterCard deferred stock units, respectively. These awards of deferred stock units will be settled on September 14, 2010 under the terms of the plan.
The deferred stock units allocated to Mr. Haythornthwaite were awarded to him in his capacity as the newly-elected Chairman of the Board. Under the terms of the plan, annual awards of deferred stock units to the non-employee directors of the Company are determined by dividing $100,000 ($150,000 in the case of the Chairman of the Board) by the average of the high and low price for the Company's Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date. However, under the plan, each non-employee director who was elected at, or whose term of office would continue after the Company's July 18, 2006 annual meeting would instead be awarded 2,565 deferred stock units and the Chairman of the Board would be awarded 3,850 deferred stock units. Since Mr. Haythornthwaite, along with the Company's other non-employee directors, was already awarded 2,565 deferred stock units upon his election by shareholders at the Company's July 18, 2006 annual meeting, Mr. Haythornthwaite's September 14, 2006 award was determined by pro-rating the difference between 3,850 and 2,565 to correspond to the approximately 10-month portion of the period from annual meeting to annual meeting that Mr. Haythornthwaite will serve as Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Freiberg's award represents a pro-rated portion of deferred stock units awarded to a non-employee director of the Company joining the Board at a time other than an annual meeting of shareholders, determined by dividing $100,000 by $61.98, the average of the high and low price for the Company's Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the September 14, 2006 grant date, pro-rated to correspond to the approximately 10-month portion of the period from annual meeting to annual meeting that Mr. Freiberg will serve as a director.

On November 1, 2006, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2006.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
In the attached press release, the Company discloses the following financial measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"):
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the attached press release.

On November 1, 2006, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2006 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2006. The company reported net income of $193 million, or $1.42 per share. Net revenues for the quarter were $902 million, a 13.9% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations (driven by the movement of the euro relative to the US dollar) contributed approximately 1% of the increase in revenues for the quarter.
Purchase, NY, November 1, 2006
Fueling the higher revenue in the third quarter was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 15.0%, on a local currency basis, to $502 billion; an 18.9% increase in the number of transactions processed; and a restructuring of cross-border transaction fees which was implemented in April 2006. Worldwide purchase volume rose 17.2%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $365 billion driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of September 30, 2006, the company's customers had issued 818 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 12.6% percent over the same period in 2005.
"These strong results underscore our success in displacing paper-based forms of payment in all corners of the globe in the face of a highly competitive payments market," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "This marks the twelfth consecutive quarter of double-digit purchase volume growth and the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit GDV growth. Over our forty year history, we have invested heavily in our global brand and payments network. We believe that merchants, consumers, corporations and governments have recognized the convenient and secure electronic payment solutions which this investment has enabled.
"With our unified global organization and our unique structure as a franchisor, processor and advisor, we are focusing our efforts full time on delivering value-added products and services that enhance the profitability of our customers' businesses, and provide innovative programs that meet and exceed their cardholders' and merchants' needs," Selander said. "At the same time, we recognize that results are best delivered locally, and our structure allows us to develop solutions that work for our customers wherever, and however, they do business."

Total operating expenses decreased 2.6% to $627 million during the quarter compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding the year-ago impact of litigation settlements and an adjustment to reflect an accounting methodology change for cash-based executive incentive plans, operating expenses increased 8.8%. This was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional staff to support the company's customer-focused strategy; a severance expense resulting from an update in plan estimates; and higher professional fees related to legal costs to defend outstanding litigation. As expected, advertising and market development expenses decreased 4.6% to $209 million versus the year-ago period due to higher spending for the 2006 FIFA World Cup earlier in the year. Currency fluctuations contributed approximately 1% of the increase in expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding special items, is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
Total other income was $17 million in the third quarter 2006 versus $16 million in the third quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by interest income from higher cash balances related to proceeds received from the company's May 2006 initial public offering. This increase was offset by a gain the company recorded in 2005 from the settlement of a contractual dispute.
Chris A. McWilton, MasterCard's chief financial officer, noted that "In our first full quarter as a publicly listed company, MasterCard delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while further improving operating margins. The third-quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the momentum within the overall payments industry. These results are particularly notable when measured against last year's strong third-quarter performance."
Year-to-Date 2006 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, MasterCard reported net income of $9 million, or $0.07 per share. Excluding the impact of special items, the company reported net income of $420 million, or $3.11 per share.
Special items, each of which occurred in the second quarter of 2006, included:
 
 
 
The company's net income and earnings per share, as well as total operating expenses discussed below, each of which exclude special items, are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $2.5 billion, an 11.9% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on revenues during this period.
Total operating expenses increased 33.2% to $2.3 billion for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution to the MasterCard Foundation, litigation settlements, and the incentive plan accounting methodology change mentioned above, total operating expenses increased 13.4% due to increased personnel costs, professional fees and sponsorship costs related to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on operating expenses during this period.
Total other income was $41 million for the nine-month period versus $4 million for the same period in 2005. This change was driven by a $45 million increase in investment income, including the $7 million special item earned on IPO proceeds. Interest expense also decreased by $8 million due to a refund of interest assessed in connection with an audit of the company's federal income tax return and a reduction of interest reserve requirements related to the company's tax reserves. In addition, $3 million was due to lower interest accretion relating to the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement.
MasterCard's effective tax rate of 95.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 includes the impact of a non-deductible, charitable stock contribution to the MasterCard Foundation. Excluding this impact, the company's tax rate would have been 34.6% vs. 35.5% for the same period in 2005. The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the share donation, is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.

Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus -branded cards, Mondex transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made (including PIN point-of-sale) with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN).
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release.
A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
The table includes information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues, including PIN point-of-sale volumes for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of [                    ], ("Grant Date") is between MasterCard Incorporated, a Delaware Corporation ("Company"), and you ("Employee"). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan").
WHEREAS, the Company has established the Plan, the terms of which Plan, are made a part hereof;
WHEREAS, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company ("Committee") has approved this grant under the terms of the Plan, conditioned on your having executed and returned to the Company the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Grant of Units.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you the number of Units reflected in your grant letter, the terms of which letter are incorporated as a part of this Agreement. Each Unit represents the right to receive an amount of the Company's $0.0001 par value Class A Common Stock ("Common Stock") that varies depending on the level of performance achieved on specified performance criteria during the performance period [                    ], through [                    ].
2. Vesting Schedule.
(a) Subject to (b) and (c) below, the interest of the Employee in the Units shall vest on [                    ], conditioned upon the Employee's continued employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer as of [                    ], and the achievement of the performance goals established by the Committee and set forth in your grant letter. Vesting in Units is subject to the Committee's exercise of downward discretion to reduce the amounts earned on achievement of performance goals.
(b) In the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates by reason of the Employee's death following the Grant Date, 100 percent of the Employee's then unvested Units shall vest and be payable at a target level of performance. In the event the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates due to Disability or Retirement more than six months after the Grant Date, unvested Units shall continue to vest as if there had been no termination of employment, provided, however, that vesting shall be conditioned on the Employee's compliance with the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement
during the vesting period and the Committee shall have discretion to determine at any time during the vesting period that an Employee shall not vest in whole or in part in a particular Unit. In the event Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates for any other reason, unvested Units shall be forfeited.
(c) In the event of a Change in Control, vesting and payment will be as set forth in sections 2(a) and 7(a) to the extent the achievement of performance goals can continue to be measured after the Change in Control. To the extent the achievement of performance goals is no longer capable of measurement following a Change in Control, 100 percent of the Employee's unvested Units shall vest on [                    ], conditioned upon the Employee's continued employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer, or successor thereto, as of [                    ], and shall be paid at a target level of performance at the time set forth in section 7(a). In the event the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer, or successor thereto, is terminated without Cause or by the Employee with Good Reason, six months preceding or two years following a Change in Control, 100 percent of the Employee's then unvested Units shall vest and be payable at a target level of performance, conditioned on the Employee's compliance with the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement.
3. Transfer Restrictions.
The Units granted hereunder may not be sold, assigned, margined, transferred, encumbered, conveyed, gifted, hypothecated, pledged, or otherwise disposed of and may not be subject to lien, garnishment, attachment or other legal process, except as expressly permitted by the Plan.
4. Stockholder Rights.
Prior to the time that Employee's Units vest and the Company has issued Common Shares relating to such Units, Employee will not be deemed to be the holder of, or have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any Common Shares deliverable with respect to such Units.
5. Dividend Equivalents.
Until such time as the Units are forfeited or become vested, whichever occurs first, the Company will pay Employee a cash amount equal to the number of Units granted hereunder times any per share dividend payment made to shareholders of the Company's Common Shares as long as the Employee continues to be employed by the Company on the dividend payment date. Such payments shall be made on or around the date the dividends are paid to shareholders, but in any event by the end of the year in which dividends are paid to shareholders.
6. Changes in Stock.
In the event of any change in the number and kind of outstanding stock by reason of any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, stock split or any similar
 
change affecting the Common Shares (other than a dividend payable in Common Shares) the Company shall make an appropriate adjustment in the number and terms of the Units credited to the Employee's Account as provided in the Plan.
7. Form and Timing of Payment.
(a) The Company shall pay four business days following the [                    ], vesting date set forth in section 2(a) above, or at such later date permitted under Code section 409A, a number of Common Shares equal to the aggregate number of Units determined to have been earned.
(b) In the event of vesting under 2(b) above due to an Employee's death, payment shall be made two business days following death or at such later date permitted under Code section 409A.
(c) In the event of vesting under Section 2(c) above due to termination in connection with a Change in Control, payment shall be made six months following the termination or at such later date permitted under Code section 409A.
8. Compliance with Law.
No Common Shares will be delivered to Employee upon the vesting of the Units unless counsel for the Company is satisfied that such delivery will be in compliance with all applicable laws.
9. Death of Employee.
In the event of the Employee's death, where the death results in vesting and payment of Units under section 2(b) above, payment shall be made to the Employee's estate or beneficiary.
10. Taxes.
The Employee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of this grant or the issuance of the Common Shares on vesting of Units hereunder. The Company is authorized to deduct the amount of the tax withholding from the amount payable to Employee upon settlement of the Units. The Company shall withhold from the total number of Common Shares Employee is to receive the value equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such withholding obligation at the minimum applicable withholding rate.
11. Discretionary Nature of Plan.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of Units under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Units, other types of grants under the Plan, or benefits in lieu of such grants in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole
 
discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of Units granted, the payment of dividend equivalents, and vesting provisions.
12. Data Authorization.
Employee acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this paragraph. The Company, its affiliates, and Employee's employer hold certain personal information about Employee, including Employee's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in Employee's favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan ("Data").

These recipients may be located in the European Economic Area, or elsewhere, such as the United States. Employee authorizes such third party recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing Employee's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of shares of stock on Employee's behalf to a broker or other third party with whom Employee may elect to deposit any shares of stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. This authorization is provided by Employee solely in connection with and for the purposes of implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Employee may, at any time, review Data, require any necessary amendments to it, inquire about the safety measures taken to protect the Data, or withdraw the consents herein in writing by contacting the Company; however, withdrawing consent may affect Employee's ability to participate in the Plan.
13. Consent to On-Line Grant and Acceptance.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that, as a term of this grant of Units, any grant, communication, or acceptance of such grant, if applicable, is permitted to be made and processed through the online system operated and maintained for this purpose. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that execution of any documents through such system shall have the same force and effect as if executed in writing.
14. Section 409A.
To the extent the Company determines that this agreement is subject to Code section 409A, but does not conform with the requirements of Code section 409A the Company may at its sole discretion amend or replace the agreement to cause the agreement to comply with Code section 409A.
 
15. Miscellaneous.
(a) All amounts granted under this Agreement shall continue for all purposes to be a part of the general assets of the Company. The Employee's interest in the amount ultimately determined to be earned shall make the Employee only a general, unsecured creditor of the Company.
(b) The parties agree to execute such further instruments and to take such action as may reasonably be necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.
(c) Any notice required or permitted hereunder that is not covered by section 13 above, shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon delivery to the Employee at the address then on file with the Company or upon delivery to the Company at 2000 Purchase Street, Purchase, New York 10577, Attn: Head of Executive and Domestic Compensation.
(d) Neither the Plan nor this Agreement nor any provisions under either shall be construed so as to grant the Employee any right to remain in the employ of the Company.
(e) This Agreement, along with the incorporated grant letter, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

The grant of Units under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Units, other types of grants under the Plan, or benefits in lieu of such grants in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of Units granted, the payment of dividend equivalents, and vesting provisions.

Employee may, at any time, review Data, require any necessary amendments to it, inquire about the safety measures taken to protect the Data, or withdraw the consents herein in writing by contacting the Company; however, withdrawing consent may affect Employee's ability to participate in the Plan.

Exhibit 10.3
THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of [                            ], ("Grant Date") is between MasterCard Incorporated, a Delaware Corporation ("Company"), and you ("Employee"). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan").
WHEREAS, the Company has established the Plan, the terms of which Plan, but not the standard terms and conditions of Section 6.4 of such Plan, are made a part hereof;
WHEREAS, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company ("Committee") has approved this grant under the terms of the Plan, conditioned on your execution and return to the Company of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Grant of Stock Options.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you a nonqualified stock option ("Stock Option") to purchase from time to time all or any part of the number of common shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock ("Common Shares") reflected in your grant letter, the terms of which grant letter are incorporated as part of this Agreement, at a price per share equal to 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares (the closing price) on the Grant Date.
2. Exercise.
This Stock Option is exercisable from the date and to the extent that the Employee's interest in the Stock Option is vested, but in no event earlier than six months after the Grant Date, until the date the term of the Stock Option expires under Section 4 below. The Employee's interest in the Stock Option may be exercised only by delivering notice of exercise, in the form prescribed by the Company, to the Company or its designated agent, and paying the full exercise price for the shares and the full amount of any taxes required to be withheld. The exercise price may be paid by delivery of cash or a certified check, delivery of Common Shares already owned by the Employee, or by delivery of cash by a broker-dealer as a "cashless" exercise. Special rules will apply to the payment of the exercise price by Employees who are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 16b-3. Common Shares issued on exercise of the Stock Option shall be unrestricted Common Shares.
3. Vesting.
(a) Subject to (b) and (c) below, the interest of the Employee in the Stock Option shall vest 25 percent on each of the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the Grant Date, conditioned upon the Employee's continued employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer as of each vesting date.
(b) In the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates by reason of the Employee's death after the grant, 100 percent of the Employee's interest in the Stock Option shall vest. In the event the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates due to Disability or Retirement, the Employee's interest in the Stock Option shall continue to vest as if there was no termination of Employment, subject to Employee's compliance with the terms of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement. In the event Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer terminates for any other reason, the Employee's unvested interest in the Stock Option shall be forfeited.
(c) In the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliated Employer, or successor thereto, is terminated without Cause or by the Employee with Good Reason, six months preceding or two years following a Change in Control, 100 percent of the Employee's then unvested interest in the Stock Option shall vest, subject to Employee's compliance with the terms of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement.
4. Term and Termination.
The Stock Option generally shall expire on the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, or (ii) in the case of a Stock Option that has vested at the time of an Employee's Termination of Employment other than by death, Disability, or Retirement, 90 days from the date of the Employee's Termination of Employment. In the event an Employee's Termination of Employment is due to death, Disability, Retirement, or is in connection with a Change in Control under the circumstances specified in Section 3(c) above, the Stock Option shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, unless the employee violates the terms of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement, in which case, the Stock Option shall expire immediately upon the violation.
5. Transfer Restrictions.
Other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, the Stock Option may not be sold, assigned, margined, transferred, encumbered, conveyed, gifted, hypothecated, pledged, or otherwise disposed of and may not be subject to lien, garnishment, attachment or other legal process, except as expressly permitted by the Plan. During the Employee's lifetime, the Stock Option is exercisable only by the Employee.
6. Stockholder Rights.
Prior to the time that the Company has issued Common Shares on an Employee's exercise of the Employee's interest in his or her Stock Option, Employee will not be
 
deemed to be the holder of, or have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any Common Shares deliverable with respect to such Stock Option.
7. Changes in Stock.
In the event of any change in the number and kind of outstanding shares of stock by reason of any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, stock split or any similar change affecting the Common Shares (other than a dividend payable in Common Shares) the Company shall make an appropriate adjustment in the terms of the Stock Option.
8. Compliance with Law.
No Common Shares will be delivered to Employee upon the Employee's exercise of his or her interest in the Stock Option unless counsel for the Company is satisfied that such delivery will be in compliance with all applicable laws.
9. Death of Employee.
In the event of the Employee's death, the Stock Option shall be exercisable by the executor or administrator of the Employee's estate or the person to whom the Stock Option has passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement.
10. Taxes.
The Employee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of the transfer of Common Shares on exercise of the Stock Option. The Employee may satisfy such taxes by delivery of cash or a certified check or delivery of cash by a broker-dealer as part of a "cashless" exercise. The Company is authorized to deduct from the total number of Common Shares Employee is to receive on exercise of the Stock Option the total value equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such withholding obligation at the minimum applicable withholding rate.
11. Discretionary Nature of Plan.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of a Stock Option under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of a Stock Option, other awards under the Plan, or benefits in lieu of such awards in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of Stock Options granted, the payment of dividend equivalents, and vesting provisions.
 
12. Data Authorization.
Employee acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this paragraph. The Company, its Subsidiaries, and Employee's employer hold certain personal information about Employee, including Employee's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all stock options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in Employee's favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan ("Data"). The Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Employee's employer will transfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of Employee's participation in the Plan, and the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Employee's employer may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. These recipients may be located in the European Economic Area, or elsewhere, such as the United States. Employee authorizes such third party recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing Employee's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Common Shares on Employee's behalf to a broker or other third party with whom Employee may elect to deposit any Common Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan.

Employee may, at any time, review Data, require any necessary amendments to it, inquire about the safety measures taken to protect the Data, or withdraw the consents herein in writing by contacting the Company; however, withdrawing consent may affect Employee's ability to participate in the Plan.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2006. For the fourth quarter, the company reported net income of $41 million, or $0.30 per share. Excluding the impact of litigation settlements, net income for the quarter was $42 million, or $0.31 per share. Net revenues for the quarter were $839 million, a 17.2% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations (driven by the movement of the euro relative to the US dollar) contributed approximately 1.9% of the increase in revenues for the quarter. For the fourth quarter 2006, total net income, earnings per share and total operating expenses, each of which excludes litigation settlements, are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, February 9, 2007
Fueling the higher revenue in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2005 was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 13.8%, on a local currency basis, to $532 billion; a 17.4% increase in the number of transactions processed to 4.4 billion; and a restructuring of cross-border transaction pricing which was implemented in April 2006. Worldwide purchase volume rose 16.7%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $391 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of December 31, 2006, the company's customers had issued 817 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 12.3% percent over the cards issued at December 31, 2005.
"Cardholders around the world used their MasterCard cards for transactions totaling almost $2 trillion in 2006  doubling the GDV we reported only five years ago, as the pace at which we are driving commerce in markets around the world gains momentum," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Our success in displacing paper-based forms of payment reflects the strength of our brand and network as well as the opportunities to implement innovative payment programs in both emerging and developed economies.

"Having invested significantly in our global brand and payments network over the past 40 years, we enter our fifth decade with a leveragable infrastructure that will allow us to provide cutting-edge payment solutions for our financial institution customers as well as merchants, consumers, corporations and governments who are increasingly turning to the convenience and security of electronic payments," Selander noted. "We expect this will enable us to continue to drive value for our shareholders."
Total operating expenses decreased 2.6%, to $793 million, during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding the impact of litigation settlements, operating expenses increased 0.5%. This was primarily driven by a $14.5 million cash contribution to the MasterCard Foundation, as part of MasterCard's previously disclosed intention to contribute up to $40 million in cash to the Foundation over four years; higher professional fees related to legal costs to defend outstanding litigation; and, an increase in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional staff to strengthen our capability to add value to our customers' businesses. Offsetting this increase was an 8.5% decrease in advertising and market development expenses versus the year-ago period due to a shift in the typical annual pattern of marketing spend to support the 2006 World Cup soccer events earlier in the year. Currency fluctuations contributed approximately 1.5% of the increase in expenses for the quarter.
Total other income was $24 million in the fourth quarter 2006 versus $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily driven by a $20 million increase in investment income.
Full-Year 2006 Results
For the year-ended December 31, 2006, MasterCard reported net income of $50 million or $0.37 per share. Excluding the impact of special items, the company reported net income of $457 million, or $3.37 per share.
Pre-tax special items for full-year 2006 included:
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
The company's full year 2006 net income, earnings per share and total operating expenses, each of which excludes special items, are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 were $3.3 billion, a 13.2% increase versus the same period in 2005. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on revenues during the year.
Total operating expenses increased 21.7%, to $3.1 billion, for the twelve-month period compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding the impact of the charitable donation of common stock to the MasterCard Foundation, litigation settlements, and an adjustment to reflect an accounting methodology change for cash-based executive incentive plans in the third quarter of 2005, total operating expenses increased 9.2%. This was due to increased personnel costs, professional fees and advertising and marketing expenses, as well as a total of $20 million in cash contributed to the MasterCard Foundation in 2006. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on operating expenses during this period.
Total other income was $65 million for the twelve-month period versus $14 million for the same period in 2005. This change was driven by a $64 million increase in investment income, including the $7 million special item of interest income earned on IPO proceeds which were used for redemption. Interest expense also decreased by $9 million primarily due to a refund of interest assessed in connection with an audit of the company's federal income tax return and a reduction of interest reserve requirements related to the company's tax reserves.
MasterCard's effective tax rate of 82.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of the non-deductible charitable donation of common stock to the MasterCard Foundation. Excluding this donation, the company's tax rate would have been 35.4% vs. 34.5% for the same period in 2005. The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the stock donation, is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.

MasterCard Board of Directors Announces Increase in Quarterly Dividend
At a meeting on February 6, 2007, the MasterCard Incorporated Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend to holders of shares of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock. A cash dividend of 15 cents per share, which represents a 66.7% increase over the prior dividend level of 9 cents per share, will be paid on May 10, 2007 to holders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of April 9, 2007.
"We are pleased that the success of our business and the strength of our capital position has allowed us to increase our dividend, further demonstrating our commitment to drive shareholder value," said Chris A. McWilton, chief financial officer.

Footnote
Set forth above is information regarding the performance results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated.
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus -branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made (including PIN point-of-sale) with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN).
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release.
A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
The table includes information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues, including PIN point-of-sale volumes for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On February 5, 2007, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2007 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on June 16, 2006) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2007 under the SEAICP are based on the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and return on equity (ROE) targets and the actual bonus award amounts will be based on an equal weighting of the level of performance achieved against such targets. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2007 annual incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
In addition, on February 6, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Nancy Karch to serve on its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Tan Teong Hean to serve on its Compensation Committee. As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, both Ms. Karch and Mr. Tan were elected to the Board of Directors on January 17, 2007.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
In December 2003, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, and eFunds Corporation ("eFunds") entered into a Marketing Sales and Services Alliance Agreement (the "Agreement") whereby the parties agreed to work together to provide debit processing services to financial institutions. After careful analysis of the needs of its customers and its business, on December 13, 2006, MasterCard notified eFunds that, pursuant to one of the provisions in the Agreement, it was terminating the Agreement. On or about January 30, 2007, eFunds filed a verified complaint against MasterCard in Superior Court for the State of Arizona, alleging that MasterCard's termination of the Agreement was improper. The complaint asserts several causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraudulent inducement. eFunds seeks a declaratory judgment that the Agreement remains in full force and effect, or, in the alternative, monetary damages.
MasterCard has not yet been served with a copy of the complaint and therefore its time to respond has not begun to run.

On April 10, 2007, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, announcing that its Board of Directors approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation designed to facilitate an accelerated, orderly conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock for subsequent sale. In a related decision, the Board approved two additional items for 2007: the conversion of up to 13.4 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock, and the repurchase of up to $500 million of Class A common stock in open market transactions, each of which is subject to stockholder approval of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation at the Company's June 7, 2007 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced that its Board of Directors approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation designed to facilitate an accelerated, orderly conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock for subsequent sale. In a related decision, the Board approved two additional items for 2007: the conversion of up to 13.4 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock, and the repurchase of up to $500 million of Class A common stock in open market transactions, each of which is subject to stockholder approval of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation at the Company's June 7, 2007 annual meeting of stockholders.
Purchase, NY, April 10, 2007
"We are pleased with the Board's proposal to stockholders which will enable a coordinated and structured conversion from Class B common stock to Class A common stock," said MasterCard President and Chief Executive Officer Robert W. Selander. "This plan reflects our strong business results and cash position and demonstrates our commitment to manage our capital structure in a manner that creates value for all shareholders."
Through "conversion transactions," in amounts and at times to be designated by the Company, current holders of shares of Class B common stock who elect to participate would be eligible to convert their shares on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock for subsequent sale to public investors within no more than 30 days. MasterCard Class B shareholders would not be allowed to participate in any Class A shareholder vote during this "transitory" ownership period.
The number of shares of Class B common stock eligible for conversion transactions would be determined by the Company and limited to an annual aggregate number of up to 10% of the total combined outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock, based upon the total number of shares outstanding as of December 31st of the prior calendar year. In addition, prior to May 31, 2010, a conversion transaction would not be permitted that would cause shares of Class B common stock to represent less than 15% of total outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding.
Class B common stock, which is held by the Company's financial institution customers, currently represents approximately 41% of the total outstanding common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Under the terms of the Company's existing certificate of incorporation, holders of Class B common stock are permitted, subject to a right of first refusal, to convert their shares into an equal number of shares of publicly traded Class A common stock at any time after May 31, 2010, the fourth anniversary of the Company's IPO. The new proposal removes the right of first refusal requirement and would allow the Company, subject to the aggregate annual share amounts and other ownership percentage limitations mentioned above, to permit conversion of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, and sale of such newly issued shares to eligible purchasers, prior to May 31, 2010.
 
MasterCard Worldwide - Page 2
 
The Company's proposal for the amendment of its certificate of incorporation has been included in a preliminary proxy statement filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Adoption of the proposed amendment requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of each of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock as well as a majority of the votes cast by holders of the Company's Class M common stock, which is also held by financial institution customers.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MasterCard conference call. My name is Lisa and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to Miss Barbara Gasper, head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.
Barbara Gasper -
MasterCard Incorporated - IR
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast for a discussion about the press release we issued earlier this morning regarding MasterCard's accelerated Class B share conversion and Class A share repurchase. With me on the call this morning are Chris McWilton, MasterCard's Chief Financial Officer, Andrea Robertson, our Corporate Treasurer, and Bart Goldstein, our In-House SEC Counsel. Following comments by Chris highlighting key points about the conversion and repurchase, we will open up the call for your questions. In total, the call will last up to 30 minutes.
Because the proxy statement associated with our upcoming annual shareholder's meeting will now include a proposal to amend our certificate of incorporation or charter, we filed a preliminary proxy statement with the S.E.C. this morning, which along with today's press release can be found on the investor relations section of our website, www.mastercard.com. Later today, a replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week until April 17th, and the transcript of this call is expected to be filed with the S.E.C. as an 8K. MasterCard and its directors, officers and other members of management and its employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from MasterCard's stockholders in connection with the proposed charter amendment. MasterCard shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement and any other relevant documents filed with the S.E.C. as they become available because they will contain important information.

Finally, as set forth in more detail in this morning's press release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements. Actual outcomes could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect potential outcomes is summarized at the end of our press release. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chris McWilton. Chris.
Chris McWilton -
MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everyone. We thought it might be helpful to spend a little time walking through the components of this morning's announcement related to an accelerated Class B share conversion as well as our Class A share repurchase. We are very pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved an amendment to our charter which will allow for an accelerated one-for-one conversion of our Class B common stock into newly issued Class A common stock for subsequent sale. Subject to stockholder approval of the amendment at our annual shareholder's meeting coming up June 7th, our board authorized two additional items. First, the total number of Class B shares eligible for accelerated conversion in 2007 would be 13.4 million shares. And second, MasterCard may repurchase up to $500 million of Class A common stock in open-market transactions during 2007.
Turning first to the details of the Class B share conversion. As you know, Class A common stock, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange represents about 59% of our total outstanding shares, 10% of which is owned by the MasterCard foundation. Class B common stock, which represents about 41% of our total outstanding shares is owned by our customersgenerally, the financial institutions that issue MasterCard branded cards. Although Class B shareholders are prohibited from owning Class A common stock, our existing charter allows holders of Class B stock, subject to a right of first refusal of other Class B shareholders, to convert their shares into an equal number of newly issued Class A shares for subsequent sale at any time after the fourth anniversary of our I.P.O. on May 31, 2010. The new amendment that the board approved removes the right of first refusal and allows for this conversion to occur gradually and over a period of time starting in 2007.
Let me highlight a few general points regarding the accelerated conversion rights. First, any conversion is completely voluntary. Each Class B holder would need to elect to participate. Next, conversion share amounts and timing windows would be designated by MasterCard's board to ensure the orderly entry of shares into the public market. The total number of Class B shares eligible for conversion would be limited to an annual aggregate amount of up to 10% of the total shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of December 31st of the prior calendar year. Newly issued Class A shares that are converted from Class B shares must be sold within a 30-day period. During this 30-day period, any Class A share that is in the process of being sold would not be permitted to participate in any Class A shareholder vote.
Prior to May 31, 2010, the amended charter would not permit a conversion transaction to take place that would cause shares of Class B common stock to represent less than 15% of the total Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. This 15% limit tracks the minimum level to maintain Class M voting rights under our existing charter. Based on our current expectation, the specifics associated with the first conversion transaction occurring in 2007 are as follows. Up to 13.4 million shares of Class B common stock would be eligible for conversion into Class A common stock. Class B shareholders would be allowed to sell up to the greater of a minimum number of shares owned or a certain percentage of shares owned as of a record date to be determined.
The first conversion window is expected to occur between our second and third quarter 2007 earnings announcements or between the months of August and October. One brokerage firm would be used for the initial conversions in 2007, so that the distribution of newly issued shares of Class A common stock into the market occurs in an organized manner. MasterCard management is quite pleased with the board's proposal to stockholders as it will allow for an accelerated and orderly conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock. The new proposal provides a design for an orderly entry of shares into the market and reduces the potential risk of supply pressure for Class A shares at a specific point in time in 2010. We believe all of our shareholders will find this an attractive proposal. This is not designed to benefit any one particular class of stock. Both Class A and Class B holders benefit from a more orderly transition, as Class B holders will be permitted to convert and sell their shares gradually over time.
Additionally, contingent upon shareholder approval of the proposed charter amendments, the board authorized a $500 million repurchase program for Class A common stock. We expect to conduct an open-market repurchase program during the second half of 2007. The decision to conduct a repurchase program was reached by MasterCard management and our board, who recognize our strong business results and cash position. Our board arrived at the $500 million figure after reviewing our financial results and capital structure. We don't expect the repurchase program to have a significant impact on 2007 earnings per share, particularly because it is occurring later in the year.
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT
 
In addition to returning capital to shareholders, the repurchase program could also provide an offset to any newly issued Class A common stock coming into the public market as a result of Class B conversion transactions. We believe this proposal and the 2007 conversion and share repurchase plans reflect our strong business results and cash position, and demonstrate our ongoing commitment to manage our capital structure in a manner that creates value for all shareholders. Finally, I should note that although the Class B shares are nonvoting and the Class M shares also held by our financial institution customers have only limited voting rights under Delaware law, this proposal requires a separate affirmative vote of all three classes of our common stock: Class A, Class B and Class M.

We're now ready to begin the question and answer period. And in order to get as many people as possible in our allotted 30-minute time frame, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question with one follow up. Additionally, since we are in our earnings quiet period, we can only address questions related to the subject matter discussed on this call. Operator, could we have the first question, please.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
Yes. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] The first question comes from the line of Liz Grausam with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Elizabeth Grausam
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
Yes, thank you. Just in terms of the appetite that you may see from Class B shareholders, is that a driver behind this decision by the board to accelerate  accelerate the conversion? Do they have a desire to sell?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Liz, hi, this is Chris. This is designed to benefit all shareholders. Our Class A and our Class B shareholders. And we thought about this in terms of how we provide the most flexibility in our capital structure and how we make sure all classes benefit from the elimination of that cliff in 2010, which you know exists under the current charter. So it's not designed or in response to demand from any particular set of shareholders. More about the overall capital structure and all of the constituents.
Elizabeth Grausam
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
Great. And then just a follow up. On the repurchase program, is that an independent decision despite the decision on the conversion? Was the buyback an independent decision of the board to realign some of your cash positions?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
No. The two are linked, and, obviously, we're very confident that we're going to get the vote so the share repurchase will move forward. But in the event it does not happen, we would go back to the board and ask them to rethink the $500 million share repurchase.
Elizabeth Grausam
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Pat Burton with Citigroup. Please proceed.

Patrick Burton
- Citigroup - Analyst
Hi. Thank you. My question, Chris, is did the board consider the litigation liabilities, and if so, is there any update there on coming up with the $500 million number. Thanks.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Hi, Pat, how are you doing?
Patrick Burton
- Citigroup - Analyst
Good.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
There are no new developments on the litigation front. The board considered, obviously, a number of factors in approving the $500 million share repurchase. As you know, we've had very strong business results. Our cash position has grown. We're always thinking about capital, and obviously we are cognizant of the litigation situation, but there's no new developments on that front. And I think the $500 million will still give us a lot of flexibility going forward.
Patrick Burton
- Citigroup - Analyst
Thanks, and congratulations on the buy back.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Chris Brendler
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Hi, good morning. Chris, could you talk about the decision to buy back and the pros and cons versus increasing the dividend payment? I guess I was thinking about where your stock is today and also your comment about cash flow being  being ahead of your projections. It would seem to me that a dividend would make a little more sense. On the flip side, I'd  from the impression that the capital reserves  the excess capital you had on the balance sheet was earmarked a little bit more for the litigation situation. So it seems to me that  to me that those dynamics would tilt a little more in favor of dividends. Could you talk about the thought process there?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
As you know, we did increase the dividends back in December,  which will take effect in May, the payout in May. So we have gone through the process of increasing the dividend. The amounts we're talking about here, in terms of $500 million is a  it's a significant buy back from our perspective. We weighed all kinds of alternatives in terms of either increasing dividend or coming up with a share repurchase plan. We think this makes sense for all of our shareholders in sort of an impactful way. I think the business results, as you know, have been very strong. The cash flow has been very strong, and we're able to do something very meaningful versus a straight-up dividend.
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT
 
Chris Brendler
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
So  just to follow up, are you saying that this gives you, I guess, a little more of an immediate and larger benefit rather  over a dividend payout?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
What it helps do is address something that is in our charter which is the cliff that exists in 2010, which could provide a lot of market discontinuity if those shares all sold at once. So this is a way to remedy that situation and relieve some of the supply pressure that would result from the conversion.
Chris Brendler
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
[OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] The next question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Gregory Smith
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Yes, hi. Good morning. Will we know when the Class B shareholders convert to Class A shares? Will investors and shareholders know that the shares will be coming on the market within the next 30 days after they convert?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Yes. We'll be providing updates in terms of how that conversion process is coming along. Obviously, the conversion window will be publicly announced, and during either the periodic reporting on our 10Qs or the earnings calls, we'll give you some indication of how that's progressing, so we won't go dark on this.
Gregory Smith
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Okay, but there won't be an S.E.C. or a filing an 8K generated when a shareholder decides to actually go through the conversion process?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
No.
Gregory Smith
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Okay. So you'll just be giving general updates.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Giving updates. Yes.
Gregory Smith
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
And then, the actual sale, so you are using a single broker. Those sales will be  designed to be dribbled into the market. So there's not going to be a  a secondary offering or big bang, so to speak?
F T
INAL

Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
That's right. We thought that was a way to minimize the impact of dumping a lot of shares into the market at one point in time, so we'll use one broker.
Gregory Smith
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Posner with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
Thank you, and good morning.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Ken.
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
Can  can you tell us roughly just for modeling purposes how much cash you think is the prudent amount to keep for litigation contingencies and other  other kinds of unforeseen or contingencies or just everyday use? At least given where we are with the litigation right now?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Well, as I mentioned earlier, Ken, there are no new developments on the litigation front. And we have not disclosed a minimum capital level that we need to run the business. I think at the end of this transaction and this repurchase, we're going to have sufficient flexibility to take advantage of opportunities within the business, grow the business and obviously have enough to take care of any sort of litigation. So the litigation as I mentioned was not a factor in developing the amount of the repurchase.
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
But there's some amount of cash you feel prudent to hold as a contingency against that?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
We've never disclosed that, and frankly as you can read in our filings it's hard to predict what amount that is going to end up being.
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
Right, no, I know, it's  well, it's not hard to predict, but it's hard to predict it accurately, I suppose. I was curious should we assume $X hundred million on the balance sheet in cash until such a time as this stuff is  is cleared up?
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT
 
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
That's a judgment call, Ken and you'd have to make that decision yourself. We're not in a position to 
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
And then just as a follow up, one of the virtues of the MasterCard business model is that it is a big producer of cash and there's not a lot of credit risk or other kinds of risk on the balance sheet. So, a financial analyst might look at the company with sort of an old fashioned view on how much capital it might need, which might not, in fact, be appropriate for the  for the nature of the business. Have you studied internally what you think the right capital structure or optimal capital structure should be for MasterCard, I mean, putting aside litigation and contingencies and stuff like that, just what would be the prudent amount of capital for the business itself?
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Well, let me start off, Ken, by reminding you that we do have a fair amount of risk in our business related to settlement, which is 
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
Right.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
 a function of what we play. So there's daily settlement risk and billions of dollars that are transferred through our system that we guarantee between issuers and acquirers. So we do have to keep that in mind and are mindful of that as we go through the process. We did take the board through where we think we need to be from a capital perspective, and we're confident again that this is going to provide us, after this transaction with enough capital to take advantage of growth in the business. I can't go into details on specifically what's the minimum level at this point in time. But we feel pretty good. And the business momentum is good right now, so we feel pretty good about it.
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
So  so having taken the board through that, at some point in the future, would it be appropriate to take analysts and investors through that kind of exercise as well? And I say that because questions of settlement risk are I think fairly technical. I know Basil and the feds and others study this stuff. And there are reasonably well understood rules, at least well understood by people who actually understand this stuff. So I'm just wondering at some point in the future would it be appropriate to tell the investment community, this is our business model. This is how settlement risk works and therefore this is the kind of range of capital that in the ordinary course of business we  you should expect us to hold for that kind of risk.
Chris McWilton
- MasterCard Incorporated - CFO
Why don't I ask Barbara to facilitate some sort of discussion around that in a forum that makes sense 
Ken Posner
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
That would be extremely helpful, thank you.

Well, I think that wraps up the questions. Obviously, we're very pleased with the board's decision to move ahead with this proposal. We think this is really going to provide for a much more orderly conversion of the Class B stock into the Class A common stock that was envisaged at the time of the I.P.O. and is currently in our charter. And, again, we think this is a win-win for all shareholders, and, obviously, are very excited about it. Thank you for your time, and, obviously, Barbara and Linda are standing by for any follow-up questions. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 2, 2007, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 2, 2007, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter ended March 31, 2007 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
  MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the first-quarter 2007. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $215 million, or $1.57 per share, on a diluted basis, the highest quarterly net income ever recorded by the company. Net revenues for the quarter were $915 million, a 23.9% increase versus the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuation (driven by the movement of the euro relative to the US dollar) contributed approximately 2.5% of the increase in revenues for the quarter.
Purchase, NY, May 2, 2007
Fueling the higher revenue in the first quarter versus the same period in 2006 was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 16.4%, on a local currency basis, to $509 billion; a 19.4% increase in the number of transactions processed to 4.2 billion; and, a restructuring of pricing, primarily cross-border transaction fees implemented in April 2006, which contributed approximately 5% of the revenue growth. Worldwide purchase volume rose 18.0%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $375 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of March 31, 2007, the company's customers had issued 835 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 11.3% percent over the cards issued at March 31, 2006.
"We are very pleased with our first-quarter financial results, which reflect the highest quarterly net income in MasterCard's history," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model and growth in electronic forms of payment. Additionally, positive secular trends and business momentum, particularly in international markets, have contributed to a strong start to the year.
"This quarter's strong volume growth, especially in markets within the South Asia/Middle East/Africa and Latin America regions, illustrates the success of our strategy and our ability to leverage our unique assets  our unified global structure, world renowned brands and advanced processing network  worldwide," said Selander.
Total operating expenses increased 8.2%, to $601 million during the first quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This was primarily driven by an increase in
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
personnel costs related to the hiring of additional staff to strengthen the company's capability to add value to its customers' businesses, and higher professional fees primarily related to legal costs to defend outstanding litigation. Offsetting this increase was a 2.3% decrease in advertising and market development expenses reflecting a shift in planned spending to later quarters this year. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 1.9% of the increase in expenses for the quarter.
Total other income was $22 million in the first quarter 2007 versus $10 million in the first quarter of 2006. The increase was primarily driven by a $16 million increase in investment income due to higher rates earned on higher cash and short-term investment balances. MasterCard's effective tax rate of 36.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2007 versus the 34.3% rate experienced in the same period in 2006, increased primarily due to state income tax expense.

Footnote
Set forth above is information regarding the performance results for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated.
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus -branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made (including Personal Identification Number (PIN) point-of-sale) with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues, including PIN point-of-sale volumes for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia Pacific region.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
GDV and cash volume in the Asia Pacific region for the three months ended March 31, 2007 are lower due to management's decision to no longer include commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches, but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers, in the calculation of GDV. Data for the comparable period in 2006 has been restated to be consistent with this approach.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

The Board may fix a record date for the purposes of determining those holders of Class M Common Stock of record whose Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), Gross Acquiring Volume (GAV) and Revenues Paid shall be included in determining a Global Proxy Calculation for a particular period, which record date shall not be more than 30 days prior to the end of any such period.

The Global Proxy Calculation for any 12-month period shall remain in effect for any and all matters until the calculation for a more recent 12-month period is made available by the Corporation. The Board may make such interpretations with respect to the implementation of the Global Proxy Calculation as it may determine to be necessary or desirable in its sole and absolute discretion and shall have the final authority, which may be delegated to the officers of the Corporation, to determine the Global Proxy Calculation for any period in its sole and absolute discretion, and any such determination shall be final and binding for all purposes unless the Board determines that an error was made in the computation, in which case the computation shall be corrected in accordance with the directions of the Board.

The Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.3(K)(8)(c). Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.

Sale of Shares by Trustee
(e) . Shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Other Voting Stock transferred to the Trustee may be redeemed by the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the per share consideration paid in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, in the case of a devise, gift or other such transaction without consideration, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift or other such transaction) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, elects to redeem such shares. The Corporation may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to 4.3(K)(8)(c). The Corporation may pay the amount of such reduction to the Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Corporation shall have the right to redeem such shares until the Trustee has sold the shares held in the Trust pursuant to Section 4.3(K)(8)(d). Upon such a redemption, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the redemption to the Prohibited Owner.

(9) .

NYSE Transactions
(11) . In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 4.3(K), the Board of the Corporation shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 4.3(K) with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it. In the event Section 4.3(K)(7) or (8) requires an action by the Board and this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Sections 4.3(K). Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 4.3(K)(7)) acquired Beneficial Ownership of Class A Common Stock and/or Other Voting Stock in violation of Section 4.3(K)(1) or (2), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first, to the shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Other Voting Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been owned directly by such Person, second, to the shares which, but for such remedies, would have been wholly Beneficially Owned (but not owned directly) by such Person, and thereafter, to the shares which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who directly own such shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Other Voting Stock based upon the relative number of the shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Other Voting Stock held by each such Person.
Ambiguity

Adjustment
(2) Any adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.6(1) to Awards that are considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A.

The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the future value of the Common Shares issued or acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
15.1 .
Amendments and Termination
The Committee may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan, or the terms of any Award Agreement under the Plan, at any time, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of a Participant under an Award theretofore granted without the Participant's consent, unless such an amendment is made to comply with applicable law (including Code Section 409A), stock exchange rules, or accounting rules. Repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be permitted. For this purpose, a "repricing" means any of the following (or any action that has the same effect as any of the following): (1) changing the terms of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right to lower its Exercise Price; (2) any other action that is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles; and (3) repurchasing for cash or cancelling an Option or Stock Appreciation Right at a time when its Exercise Price is greater than the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another Award, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with an event set forth in Section 4.6. A cancellation and exchange described in this Section 15.1(3) shall be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any material amendments to the Plan shall require shareholder approval to the extent required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange or market that regulates the securities of the Company.

Table of Contents
 
exercise, vesting or payment of an Award and restrictions on transferability of any Common Shares issued or delivered pursuant to an Award), provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. The Committee may subject an Award to such conditions as it determines are necessary or appropriate to ensure that an Award constitutes "qualified performance based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Awards under a particular Article of the Plan need not be uniform, and Awards under more than one Article of the Plan may be combined in a single Award Agreement. Any combination of Awards may be granted at one time and on more than one occasion to the same Participant. An Award Agreement for Restricted Stock Units or Performance Units may provide that a Participant may elect to defer receipt of income attributable to the Award. In the event no such election is provided or made, and the Award Agreement does not otherwise provide, the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units shall be payable to the Participant within 2

Any loan will be made upon such terms and conditions that the Committee shall determine.
15.5 .
Unfunded Status of Plan
It is intended that the Plan be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Shares or make payments; provided, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

Where expressly provided in writing by the Committee, Awards granted to persons who are (or may become) Covered Employees within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, shall constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" satisfying the relevant requirements of Code Section 162(m). Accordingly, in the case of such Awards, the Plan shall be administered and the provisions of the Plan shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m). If any provision of the Plan or any Agreement relating to such an Award does not comply or is inconsistent with

Withholding
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for income tax purposes with respect to any Award, the Participant shall pay to the Company (or other entity identified by the Committee), or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or other entity identified by the Committee regarding the payment of, any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind (including any employment taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to such income. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and its Affiliated Employers shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant. Subject to approval by the Committee, a Participant may elect to have such tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by (i) the delivery of cash or a certified check, (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from Common Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate value that would satisfy the required statutory minimum (but no more than such required minimum) with respect to the Company's withholding obligation, (iii) authorizing the Company to effect a net issuance of Common Shares to satisfy the required statutory minimum withholding (but no more than the minimum), (iv) transferring to the Company Common Shares owned by the Participant with an aggregate value that would satisfy the required statutory minimum (but no more than such required minimum) with respect to the Company's withholding obligation, or (v) in the case of Options, by means of delivery of cash by a broker-dealer as a "cashless exercise."

On August 1, 2007, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
 
On August 1, 2007, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter ended June 30, 2007 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for second-quarter 2007. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $195 million, or $1.43 per share on a diluted basis, excluding special items, and net income of $252 million, or $1.85 per share on a diluted basis, including special items. The company's total operating expenses, total other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, August 1, 2007
Net revenues for the quarter were $997 million, a 17.8% increase versus the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuation (driven by the movement of the euro relative to the US dollar) contributed approximately 2.0% of the increase in revenues for the quarter.
Fueling the higher revenue in the second quarter versus the same period in 2006 was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 13.3%, on a local currency basis, to $555 billion; a 15.2% increase in the number of transactions processed to 4.6 billion; and, an increase in cross-border transaction volumes of 17.3%. Worldwide purchase volume rose 14.8%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $414 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of June 30, 2007, the company's customers had issued 855 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 10.7% percent over the cards issued at June 30, 2006.
"We are very pleased with our second-quarter financial results, which reflect strong growth across all regions and represent the highest quarterly net revenue in MasterCard's history," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "This also marked our 13
th
consecutive quarter of double-digit GDV growth.
"Our evolution over several years to a more rigorous commercial environment as well as our investment in people and technology have helped us achieve success for our customers and for our shareholders, and we remain absolutely committed to both over the years ahead," added Selander.

Special items for the second quarter of 2007 included:
 
 
For the second quarter of 2006, special items included:
 
 
 
Total operating expenses increased 3.2%, to $725 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, excluding special items for both periods mentioned above. This increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs related to the planned hiring of additional staff and contractors to support the company's customers, an increase in professional fees related to external costs to advance our key strategic initiatives and legal costs to defend outstanding litigation. Offsetting this increase was a 12.6% decrease in advertising and market development expenses reflecting significant World Cup sponsorship activity in the second quarter of 2006, as well as a planned shift in 2007 spending to later quarters this year. On a GAAP basis, which includes special items, operating expenses decreased 35.0%, to $728 million. Currency fluctuation negatively impacted the decrease in total operating expenses by approximately 0.7% for the quarter.
Total other income was $117 million in the second quarter 2007 versus $13 million in the second quarter of 2006, including special items in both periods. The increase was driven by a $92 million increase in other income, primarily related to a settlement received under an agreement to discontinue the company's sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events.
MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate was 34.7% in the three months ended June 30, 2007, versus the non-GAAP rate of 33.6% in the comparable period in 2006. MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate in 2006 was significantly impacted by the share donation to the MasterCard Foundation. The year-over-year difference was due to an increase in state income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as required under the recently adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48.

Year-to-Date 2007 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, MasterCard reported net income of $410 million, or $3.00 per share, on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of special items. On a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of special items, the company reported net income of $467 million, or $3.42 per share on a diluted basis.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $1.9 billion, a 20.6% increase versus the same period in 2006. In addition to growth in GDV, processed transactions and cross-border transaction volumes, this increase was driven by a restructuring of pricing, primarily cross-border transaction pricing implemented in April 2006, which contributed approximately 2.0% of the revenue growth in the year-to-date period. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 2.3% of the increase in revenues in the year-to-date period.
Total operating expenses increased 5.4%, to $1.3 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2006, excluding special items for both periods. Including special items, operating expenses decreased 20.7%, to $1.3 billion. Currency fluctuation negatively impacted the decrease in operating expenses by approximately 1.0% in the year-to-date period.
Total other income was $139 million for the six-month period versus $23 million for the same period in 2006, including special items in both periods. The increase was driven by a $92 million increase in other income, primarily related to a settlement received under an agreement to discontinue the company's sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. Additionally, investment income increased $23 million due to higher cash and short-term investment balances primarily related to the proceeds received from the company's IPO, increases in interest rates and cash generated by the company's business.
MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate was 35.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2007, versus the non-GAAP rate of 34.0% in the comparable period in 2006. MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate in 2006 was significantly impacted by the share donation to the MasterCard Foundation. The year-over-year difference was due to an increase in state income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as required under the recently adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus -branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, GDV excludes commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches, but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for the comparable periods in 2006 have been updated to be consistent with this approach.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for third-quarter 2007. For the quarter, the company reported quarterly net income of $314 million, or $2.31 per share on a diluted basis, which includes after-tax gains of $70 million or $0.51 per share on a diluted basis from the partial sale of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil.
Purchase, NY, October 31, 2007
Net revenues for the quarter were a record, at $1.08 billion, a 20.1% increase versus the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuation (driven by the movement of the euro relative to the US dollar) contributed approximately 2.3% of the increase in revenues for the quarter.
Fueling the higher revenue in the third quarter versus the same period in 2006 was growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 12.8% on a local currency basis, to $577 billion; a 13.3% increase in the number of transactions processed to 4.8 billion; and, an increase in cross-border volumes of 20.6%.
Worldwide purchase volume rose 14.1%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $430 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of September 30, 2007, the company's customers had issued 878 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 11.3% over the cards issued at September 30, 2006.
"Our solid performance illustrates the strength of our diverse, global business," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "We continue to benefit from positive secular trends and outstanding growth in international and emerging markets such as South Asia/Middle East/Africa and Latin America.
"As a unified global company, one of our strongest assets is our ability to align with our customers anywhere worldwide. As our business continues to grow, we are committed to delivering best-in-class dedicated customer account teams, and to finding the right talent to help MasterCard, and our customers, win in the marketplace," said Selander.

Total operating expenses increased 16.3%, to $730 million, in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was primarily driven by higher advertising and market development expenses in the quarter, which increased 26.4%, to $264 million, resulting from a change in the timing of 2007 initiatives compared to the same period last year. The first half of 2006 had significant World Cup sponsorship activity versus this year, where a planned shift in spending to the second half of 2007 had been anticipated.
General and administrative expenses increased 10.2%, to $433 million, in the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by personnel costs related to hiring of additional staff and contractors to support the company's customers as well as increased performance incentive accruals. The increase in total operating expenses was also driven by a $10 million cash contribution to the MasterCard Foundation.
Currency fluctuation contributed 1.6% of the growth in total operating expenses for the quarter.
Total other income was $129 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $17 million in the same period in 2006. The improvement was driven by a $112 million increase in investment income primarily due to gains realized from the sale of 25% of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. Redecard gains contributed $0.51 per share on a diluted basis to the quarterly earnings per share of $2.31.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 34.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2007, versus 33.9% in the comparable period in 2006. The year-over-year difference was due to an increase in state income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as required under provisions of the recently adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48").
Year-to-Date 2007 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, MasterCard reported net income of $782 million or $5.73 per share, on a diluted basis, including the impact of special items. Excluding the impact of special items, the company reported net income of $724 million, or $5.31 per share, on a diluted basis. The company's total operating expenses, total other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Special items for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 included:

Special items for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 included:
 
 
 
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was approximately $3 billion, a 20.4% increase versus the same period in 2006. In addition to growth in GDV and processed transactions, this increase was driven by a restructuring of pricing, including cross-border transaction pricing implemented in April 2006. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 2.3% of the increase in revenues in the year-to-date period.
Total operating expenses increased 9.1%, to $2.1 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2006, excluding special items for both periods. Including special items, operating expenses decreased 10.6%, to $2.1 billion. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 1.2% growth in total operating expenses in the year-to-date period.
Total other income was $268 million for the nine-month period versus $41 million for the same period in 2006, on a GAAP basis in both periods. The year-over-year difference was driven by a $135 million increase in investment income primarily due to gains realized from the sale of 25% of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. Redecard gains contributed $0.51 per share on a diluted basis to the earnings per share of $5.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Additionally, other income increased $91 million primarily related to a settlement received under an agreement to discontinue the company's sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events.
MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate was 35.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2007, versus the non-GAAP rate of 34.6% in the comparable period in 2006. MasterCard's GAAP effective tax rate in 2006 was significantly impacted by the share donation to the MasterCard Foundation. The year-over-year difference, excluding the effects of the donation, was due to the effect of a New York state tax law change and a net increase in the accrual of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as required under provisions of the recently adopted FIN 48.

Class A Share Repurchase Update and Additional Class A Share Repurchase
In April 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its Class A common stock in open market transactions during 2007. As of September 30, 2007, approximately 2.0 million shares of Class A common stock had been repurchased at a cost of $277 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2007, the Company repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of $223 million, completing the initial $500 million repurchase plan.
On October 29, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors amended the share repurchase plan to authorize the Company to repurchase an incremental $750 million, for an aggregate of the entire repurchase program of $1.25 billion of Class A common stock in open market transactions on or prior to June 30, 2008.
"Our continued strong business results and cash position have enabled us to fund an incremental $750 million Class A repurchase program," said Chris A. McWilton, chief financial officer. "This program demonstrates our commitment to enhance shareholder value and is in addition to the $500 million share repurchase program approved by our Board and completed earlier this year."
Class B Share Conversion Update
In April 2007, MasterCard announced that its Board of Directors had approved plans for certain accelerated Class B share conversions subject to shareholder approval of changes to the company's corporate charter. In June, after receiving shareholder approval at its Annual Meeting, the company announced that current holders of Class B common stock who elected to participate would be eligible in 2007 to convert up to an aggregate of 13.4 million shares of Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock for subsequent sale to public investors. The first election window for this conversion program extended from August 4, 2007 through October 5, 2007.
As of September 30, 2007, approximately 5.0 million shares of Class B common stock had been converted into Class A common stock as part of the initial conversion program. Subsequent to September 30, 2007, an additional 2.6 million shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, for a total of 7.6 million shares converted during the initial share conversion window.
In October 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved a second program for 2007, allowing for the conversion of the balance of the initially approved 13.4 million shares, or up to 5.8 million shares of Class B into Class A common stock. The election window for this conversion program will begin on November 17, 2007 and end no later than December 14, 2007.

Note that columns in the tables above may not add due to rounding; growth represents change from the comparable year-ago period.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 11
 
Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard customers that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, GDV excludes commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches, but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for the comparable periods in 2006 have been updated to be consistent with this approach.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

ITEM 8.01    OTHER EVENTS
MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Noah J. Hanft, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and Michael W. Michl, Chief Administrative Officer (collectively, the "Executives"), entered into pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares for personal financial management purposes, both designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (collectively, the "10b5-1 Plans").
The plan entered into by Mr. Michl allows for the sale of a maximum of: (i) approximately 16,572 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A common stock"), associated with restricted stock unit awards and (ii) 3,269 shares of Class A common stock underlying stock option awards. The plan entered into by Mr. Hanft allows for the sale of a maximum of approximately 5,673 shares of Class A common stock associated with restricted stock unit awards. Sales of shares by both Executives pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plans are expected to occur over a five-month period and provide for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to specified limitations.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 22, 2008, the Board of Directors of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") elected Jos Octavio Reyes Lagunes as a Class A director. Mr. Reyes is President, Latin America Group at The Coca-Cola Company.

On January 31, 2008, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
 
On January 31, 2008, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2007. For the fourth-quarter 2007, the company reported net income of $304 million, or $2.26 per share on a diluted basis, which included after-tax gains of $185 million, or $1.37 per share on a diluted basis, from additional sales of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil.
Purchase, NY, January 31, 2008
Net revenues for the fourth-quarter 2007 were $1.07 billion, a 27.8% increase versus the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuations (driven by movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 4.7% of the increase in net revenue for the quarter.
Fueling the higher revenue in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2006 was: growth in MasterCard's gross dollar volume (GDV), which increased 15.2%, on a local currency basis, to $634 billion; a 17.2% increase in the number of transactions processed to 5.2 billion; and, an increase in cross-border volumes of 27.7%.
Worldwide purchase volume rose 16.1%, on a local currency basis, during the quarter to $477 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of December 31, 2007, the company's financial institution customers had issued 916 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 12.6% over the cards issued at December 31, 2006.
"Our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the strength of MasterCard's global business model," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "We continue to benefit from the worldwide demand for electronic payments, solid performance in high-growth regions such as South Asia/Middle East/Africa and Latin America, as well as strong growth in processed transactions and cross-border travel volumes.
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
"Despite economic uncertainties in the U.S., we continue to leverage our unique assets and world-renowned brands to position MasterCard for long-term growth and success. Our diverse offerings and unparalleled global payments insights are clearly resonating with our customers and merchants around the world," said Selander.
Total operating expenses increased 13.5%, to $901 million, during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.3% of the increase in expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007. Growth in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
 
During the quarter, the company made a $10 million cash contribution to the MasterCard Foundation, completing MasterCard's previously disclosed intention to contribute up to $40 million in cash to the Foundation within four years following MasterCard's May 2006 initial public offering.
Total other income was $295 million in the fourth-quarter 2007 versus $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase was driven primarily by $284 million in pre-tax gains realized from additional sales of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. On an after-tax basis, Redecard gains contributed $1.37 per share on a diluted basis to the quarterly earnings per share of $2.26.
Full-Year 2007 Results
For the year-ended December 31, 2007, MasterCard reported net income of $1.09 billion, or $8.00 per share on a diluted basis, which includes after-tax gains of $254 million, or $1.87 per share on a diluted basis, from selling a significant portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. Excluding the impact of special items mentioned below, the company reported net income of $1.03 billion, or $7.58 per share, on a diluted basis.

Special items for the full-year 2007 included:
 
 
Special items for the full-year 2006 included:
 
 
 
The company's full-year 2007 net income, earnings per share and total operating expenses, each of which excludes special items, are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Net revenues for the full year were $4.1 billion, a 22.3% increase versus the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuations (driven primarily by movement of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 3.1% of the increase in revenues for the full-year.
Total operating expenses decreased 4.4%, to $3.0 billion, for the twelve-month period compared to the same period in 2006. Currency fluctuations contributed 1.8% of the increase in expenses in 2007. Excluding the impact of special items in both 2006 and 2007 noted above, total operating expenses increased 10.4%. This increase was driven by:
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 4
 
Total other income was $563 million for the twelve-month period versus $65 million for the same period in 2006. The improvement was driven by a $405 million increase in investment income primarily due to gains realized from sales of a significant portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. The improvement in other income was also driven by a $90 million settlement received under an agreement to discontinue the company's sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, compared to 82.9% for the full-year 2006. MasterCard's U.S. GAAP effective tax rate in 2006 was significantly impacted by a donation of shares to the MasterCard Foundation. Excluding this donation, the company's tax rate would have been 35.4% in 2006. The year-over-year difference, excluding the effects of the donation, was due to lower effective state tax rates based on the composition of taxable income in 2007.
The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the stock donation, is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
The company ended the year with $3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.
Class A Share Repurchase Update
In April 2007, the MasterCard Board of Directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to $500 million of its Class A common stock in open market transactions during 2007. On October 29, 2007, the Board amended the share repurchase plan to authorize the company to repurchase an incremental $750 million (an aggregate for the entire repurchase program of $1.25 billion) of its Class A common stock in open market transactions through June 30, 2008.
As of December 31, 2007, approximately 4 million shares of Class A common stock had been repurchased at a cost of $601 million. As of January 25, 2008, the company repurchased an additional 657 thousand shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of $124 million.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 5
 
Class B Share Conversion Update
During 2007, the company implemented and completed two separate conversion programs in which 11.4 million shares, of an eligible 13.4 million shares, of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock and subsequently sold to public investors.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007, GDV excludes commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches, but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for the comparable periods in 2006 have been updated to be consistent with this approach.
Performance information for prior periods may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

On February 4, 2008, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2008 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on April 26, 2007) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2008 under the SEAICP are based upon the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and operating margin improvement targets. Actual bonus award amounts will be based upon a weighting of two-thirds for actual performance achieved against the net income target and one-third for actual performance achieved against the operating margin improvement target. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2008 annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
Also on February 4, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved increases to annual base salaries for certain of its named executive officers, to be effective March 1, 2008. These increases in annual base salaries are set forth on Exhibit 10.1, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2008. The company reported net income of $398 million, or $3.01 per share on a diluted basis, excluding a special item related to a $49 million after-tax gain from the termination of a customer business agreement. Including this special item, net income was $447 million, or $3.38 per share, on a diluted basis. Net income also incorporates after-tax gains of $56 million, or $0.42 per share on a diluted basis, from the remaining sales of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. The company's total other income, net income and earnings per share, excluding the special item, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, April 29, 2008
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2008 was $1.2 billion, a 29.2% increase versus the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations (driven by movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 5.1% of the increase in net revenue for the quarter. Fueling the higher net revenue in the first quarter versus the same period in 2007 were:
 
 
 
 
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter rose 15.0%, on a local currency basis, versus the first quarter of 2007, to $453 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of March 31, 2008, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 935 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 12.1% over the cards issued at March 31, 2007.

"We are very pleased with our first-quarter financial results, which reflect the strong positioning of our unified global business," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Regions outside the U.S., such as Latin America and South Asia, Middle East and Africa, are driving significant growth, and cross-border volumes remain healthy as cardholders continue to travel and prefer the use of electronic over paper-based forms of payment.
"MasterCard continues to see growth in the U.S. region despite continued economic uncertainty," Selander stated. "In this challenging economic environment, we are working closely with our customers to deliver the value and insights they have come to expect to help them meet their business objectives. We are committed to accelerating the global expansion of electronic payments, and are making investments to ensure we are properly aligned with our customers and merchants wherever they do business," said Selander.
Total operating expenses increased 10.9%, to $666 million, during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.3% of the increase in expenses for the first quarter of 2008. Growth in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Total other income was $173 million in the first quarter of 2008 versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2007, including the $75 million pre-tax gain from the termination of a customer business agreement. Excluding this special item, total other income increased $76 million versus the first quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by $86 million in pre-tax gains from remaining sales of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil, partially offset by other investment losses.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2008, versus 36.0% in the comparable period in 2007. The company's tax rate was lower in the first quarter of 2008 due to tax reserves not increasing at the same level of the increase in pre-tax income.

Class A Share Repurchase Update
In April 2007, the MasterCard Board of Directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to $500 million of its Class A common stock in open market transactions during 2007. On October 29, 2007, the Board amended the share repurchase plan to authorize the company to repurchase an incremental $750 million (an aggregate for the entire repurchase program of $1.25 billion) of its Class A common stock in open market transactions through June 30, 2008.
During the first quarter, approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock had been repurchased at a cost of $294 million. As of April 29, 2008, the company repurchased approximately 557,000 additional shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of $129 million, for a total of $1.02 billion of the approved $1.25 billion completed.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

On June 24, 2008, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated (collectively, "MasterCard" or the "Company") entered into a settlement agreement (the "Settlement") with American Express Company ("American Express") relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation between MasterCard and American Express. This Settlement ends all existing litigation between American Express and MasterCard. A copy of the Company's press release announcing the Settlement is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
As described in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1, under the Settlement, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard will pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum of $1.8 billion. MasterCard expects to take a charge of approximately $1 billion on a tax-affected net present value basis in the second quarter of 2008. The charge is based upon MasterCard's assumption that American Express will achieve the financial performance hurdles described below. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15% of American Express's United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter, up to a maximum of $150 million per quarter. If, however, the payment for any quarter is less than $150 million, the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between $150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 MasterCard Incorporated today announced it has reached an agreement to settle its outstanding litigation with American Express.
Purchase, NY, June 25, 2008
The form of the agreement calls for 12 quarterly payments by MasterCard, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, of $150 million, contingent upon the performance of American Express's U.S. Global Network Services business. On a tax-affected net present value basis, the settlement payments are estimated to be, in the aggregate, approximately $1 billion. MasterCard will take a charge for the settlement in the current quarter. The maximum nominal amount of the settlement is $1.8 billion.
"We are pleased to have reached a settlement with terms that will enable us to keep our strong balance sheet intact, so we can continue to build on our exceptional business results and vigorously pursue our strategy," said MasterCard President and Chief Executive Officer Robert W. Selander. "Eliminating the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case is in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers and our management team," he stated.

 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2008. The company reported net income of $276 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, excluding a special item, and a net loss of $747 million, or $5.74 per diluted share, including the special item  a $1.0 billion after-tax charge related to an antitrust litigation settlement with American Express.

Purchase, NY, July 31, 2008
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2008 was $1.2 billion, a 25.0% increase versus the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations (driven by movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 5.4 percentage points of the increase in net revenue for the quarter. Fueling the higher net revenue in the second quarter versus the same period in 2007 were:
 
 
 
 
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter rose 14.0%, on a local currency basis, versus the second quarter of 2007, to $493 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of June 30, 2008, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 951 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 11.0% over the cards issued at June 30, 2007.
"We are pleased that we have been able to continue to deliver solid financial results in the current economic climate," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Businesses, consumers and governments around the world are demonstrating a growing preference for electronic payments, and our cross-border

volumes remain healthy as cardholders come to rely on electronic payments and the ease, security and convenience they provide. Additionally, more than 50% of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., which helps to moderate the impact of an economic downturn in one particular region.
"During these challenging times, we are working closely with our financial-institution customers to identify and deliver solutions that help maximize their payments business," added Selander. "This quarter, we introduced Integrated Processing Solutions (IPS)  our new debit processing platform  in the U.S. and successfully implemented our first customer, Security Service Federal Credit Union (SSFCU). We also announced an agreement with Obopay to offer a fully integrated, on-demand, person-to-person mobile payment service. These examples illustrate our commitment to developing innovative solutions designed to meet the needs of today's cardholder while driving value and growth for our customers and merchants."
The special item for the second quarter of 2008 represented:
 
Special items for the second quarter of 2007 included:
 
 
Excluding special items, total operating expenses increased 14.6%, to $830 million, during the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations contributed 4.5 percentage points of the increase in expenses for the second quarter of 2008. Growth in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including special items, total operating expenses increased 240.6%, to $2.48 billion.
Total other income was $10 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus $117 million in the second quarter of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition in 2007 of a $90 million gain related to a settlement with the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events.

Excluding special items in both periods, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.3% in the second quarter of 2008, versus 34.7% in the comparable period in 2007. Including special items, the effective tax rate was 39.0% for the second quarter of 2008, versus 34.7% in the comparable period in 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax rate related to the American Express settlement charge, which provides a tax benefit due to the change in the geographic distribution of pre-tax income or loss.
Year-to-Date 2008 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, MasterCard reported net income of $674 million, or $5.13 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items, and a net loss of $300 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, including special items.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $2.4 billion, a 27.0% increase versus the same period in 2007. In addition to growth in GDV, processed transactions and cross-border transaction volumes, this increase was driven by pricing changes, primarily cross-border transaction pricing implemented in January 2008, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points of the revenue growth in the year-to-date period. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 5.2 percentage points of the increase in revenue in the year-to-date period.
Total operating expenses increased 12.9%, to $1.5 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2007, excluding special items for both periods. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.9 percentage points of this increase. Including special items, operating expenses increased 136.7%, to $3.15 billion.
Total other income was $183 million for the six-month period versus $139 million for the same period in 2007, including special items in both periods. The increase was primarily driven by gains from the sale of Redecard securities and the termination of a customer business agreement in 2008, offset by settlement received in 2007 related to discontinuing the company's sponsorship of World Cup soccer events.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 35.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2008, versus a rate of 35.3% in the comparable period in 2007. Including the special items, the effective tax rate was 43.9% for the 2008 period, and 35.3% for the 2007 period.

Class A Share Repurchase Program
In April 2007, the MasterCard Board of Directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to $500 million of its Class A common stock in open market transactions during 2007. On October 29, 2007, the Board amended the share repurchase plan to authorize the company to repurchase an incremental $750 million (an aggregate for the entire repurchase program of $1.25 billion) of its Class A common stock in open market transactions through June 30, 2008.
During the second quarter of 2008, the company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $355 million, completing its aggregate authorized share repurchase program of $1.25 billion.

In February 2008, the MasterCard Board of Directors authorized the conversion and sale or transfer of up to 13.1 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock. In May 2008, the company implemented and completed a conversion program in which all of the 13.1 million authorized shares of Class B common stock were converted into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock and subsequently sold or transferred by participating holders of Class B common stock to public investors.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 27, 2008, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard") entered into a Release and Settlement Agreement (the "Settlement") with Discover Financial Services ("Discover") and Visa, Inc. ("Visa") to settle outstanding litigation brought against MasterCard and Visa by Discover. This Settlement ends all existing litigation between the parties. Pursuant to the Settlement, MasterCard will pay to Discover $862.5 million in November 2008, which payment will be made pursuant to the terms of a judgment-sharing agreement entered into with Visa on July 29, 2008. In addition, in connection with the Settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discover's former parent company, agreed to pay MasterCard $35 million, resulting in a net settlement for MasterCard of $827.5 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 MasterCard Incorporated today announced that final agreement has been reached to settle outstanding litigation brought against MasterCard and Visa by Discover Financial Services. As a result, MasterCard will take a net after-tax charge of $515.5 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Purchase, NY, October 27, 2008
MasterCard will pay $862.5 million of the total $2.75 billion settlement reflecting the terms of a judgment-sharing agreement with Visa that was finalized in July, 2008. In addition, in connection with the settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discover's former parent company, agreed to pay MasterCard $35 million, resulting in a net settlement of $827.5 million. MasterCard will make its payment to Discover and receive the payment from Morgan Stanley in November.
"We believe Discover's lack of success resulted from decisions that created a business model that is not attractive to bank issuers. Nonetheless, we chose to settle this lawsuit to avoid the uncertainty and distraction of a lengthy jury trial. This result, which is in no way an admission of liability, is in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers and our company," said MasterCard General Counsel Noah J. Hanft. "We will continue to focus on out-competing Discover in the marketplace, where real-world performance is what counts."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2008. The company reported net income of $322 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, excluding a special item, and a net loss of $194 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, including the special item  a $515.5 million net after-tax charge related to an antitrust litigation settlement. The company's total operating expenses, operating margin, other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding the special item, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, November 3, 2008
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2008 was $1.3 billion, a 23.6% increase versus the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations (driven by movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 3.5 percentage points of the increase in net revenue for the quarter. The higher net revenue in the third quarter versus the same period in 2007 was fueled by:
 
 
 
 
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter rose 13.3% on a local currency basis, versus the third quarter of 2007, to $497 billion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of September 30, 2008, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 970 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 10.3% over the cards issued at September 30, 2007.
"We are very pleased with our third-quarter performance and our ability to deliver strong financial results given the declining global economy," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "At a time of unprecedented economic challenges, consumers, businesses, and governments around the world have continued to migrate toward various forms of electronic payments."
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
Selander also noted: "As we are not immune from the long-term effects of the current economic environment, we have significantly accelerated the focus on our cost structure, while making sure we remain prudent in allocating resources to those investments that will enable us to drive growth worldwide, today and in the future. Our focus on our customers has never been more important as we work side by side with financial institutions to help them continue to develop the value of their payments businesses. Our account teams and MasterCard Advisors are helping our customers address risk management, reduce write-offs, improve segmentation efforts, and deliver more relevant messages to cardholders.
"Looking ahead, the long-term opportunity for MasterCard remains unchanged  to displace cash and checks, and continue to advance commerce globally, creating long-term value for our customers, merchants and shareholders alike," said Selander.
The special item for the third quarter of 2008 represented:
 
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 8.3%, to $790 million, during the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations contributed 2.4 percentage points of this increase. Growth in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including the special item, total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2008 increased 121.7% versus the year-ago period, to $1.6 billion.
Excluding the special item, the operating margin was 41.0% for the third quarter of 2008, up 8.4 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including the special item, the operating margin was a negative 20.9% for the third quarter of 2008.
Total other expense was $14 million in the third quarter of 2008 versus other income of $129 million in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to gains realized in the third quarter of 2007 from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil. Interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $23 million primarily due to the interest accretion associated with the American Express settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2008.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
Excluding the special item, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 39.7% in the third quarter of 2008, versus 34.8% in the comparable period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the company's estimated effective state tax rate. Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 34.1% benefit and 34.8% expense for the third quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefit related to the charge for the Discover settlement, partially offset by the tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets.
Year-to-Date 2008 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, MasterCard reported net income of $1.0 billion, or $7.59 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items, and a net loss of $493 million, or $3.79 per diluted share, including special items.
Special items for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, included:
 
 
 
Special items for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 included:
 
 
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $3.8 billion, a 25.8% increase versus the same period in 2007. In addition to growth in GDV, processed transactions and cross-border transaction volumes, this increase was driven by pricing changes, primarily cross-border transaction pricing implemented in January 2008, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points of the revenue growth in the year-to-date period. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 4.6 percentage points of the increase in revenue in the year-to-date period.
Excluding special items for both periods, total operating expenses increased 11.3%, to $2.3 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to higher personnel expenses. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.3 percentage points of this increase. Including special items, operating expenses increased 131.4%, to $4.8 billion.
Excluding special items, the operating margin was 39.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, up 7.9 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including special items, the operating margin was a negative 26.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.
Total other income was $169 million for the nine-month period versus $268 million for the same period in 2007, including special items in both periods. The decrease was primarily
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 4
 
driven by lower gains and dividends from the sale of Redecard securities and the settlement received in 2007 related to discontinuing the company's sponsorship of World Cup soccer events, partially offset by the termination of a customer business agreement in the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $25 million primarily due to the interest accretion associated with the American Express settlement.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 36.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, versus a rate of 35.1% in the comparable period in 2007. The increase was primarily driven by a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, as a result of a change in the company's estimated effective state tax rate. Including the special items, the effective tax rate was 40.4% for the 2008 period, and 35.1% for the 2007 period. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefits related to the charges for the American Express and Discover settlements. This was partially offset by the tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 2, 2008, the Board of Directors of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved amendments to, and restated, the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Amended and Restated Bylaws"). The material changes effected by the adoption of the Amended and Restated Bylaws were to (i) expand the information required to be provided by any stockholder who proposes director nominations or any other business for consideration at a meeting of stockholders, including disclosure of hedging activity, and to require periodic updating of such information and (ii) update the advance notice provisions to ensure that such provisions are clear and unambiguous and that compliance with the notice procedures set forth in the Advanced and Restated Bylaws is the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business at a meeting of stockholders. The Amended and Restated Bylaws became effective on December 2, 2008.
A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Corporation") for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, if any, within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board").
Section 2. Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, notice of the time, place (if any) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be given not more than sixty, nor less than ten, days previous thereto, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting at such address as appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation; but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders present may, to the extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
Section 5. The Chairman of the Board, or in the Chairman's absence or at the Chairman's direction, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer's absence or at the Chief Executive Officer's direction, any officer of the Corporation shall call all meetings
2
 
of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of any such meetings. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in such officer's absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, convening the meeting and adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of record of the Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting, whether any stockholder or stockholder's proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the chairman of the meeting, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate.
3
 
Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 8. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders (a) entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or (b) entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date (i) in the case of clause (a) above, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting and (ii) in the case of clause (b) above, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such action. If for any reason the Board shall not have fixed a record date for any such purpose, the record date for such purpose shall be determined as provided by law. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed or determined shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date so fixed or determined.
Section 9. At any time when the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation permits action by one or more classes of stockholders of the Corporation to be taken by written consent, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents properly delivered in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, this section and the DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date of the meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been
4
 
fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Section 10. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
Section 11. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the Corporation or candidates for office. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Inspectors of stockholder votes shall, subject to the power of the chairman of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.

General.
(i) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors or as members of the European Board and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 12, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of
8
 
stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(ii) For purposes of this By-Law, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(iii) For purposes of this By-Law, no adjournment or postponement or notice of adjournment or postponement of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice of such meeting for purposes of this Section 12, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 12 to be timely, such notification must be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the originally scheduled meeting.
(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law; provided however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this By-Law (including paragraphs (A)(i)(c) and (B) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs (A)(i)(c) and (B) of this By-Law shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business. Nothing in this By-Law shall apply to the right, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or of Class M Common Stock (in each case, as defined in the Corporation's certificate of incorporation) to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Corporation's certificate of incorporation.
Section 1. The Board shall consist, subject to the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, of such number of directors, not less than three nor more than twelve, as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of the majority of the Board. The Board may also appoint one person, who has previously served on the Board of the Corporation and who is not a director, officer or employee of, and does not represent, a Member (as defined in the Corporation's certificate of incorporation), to participate in the deliberations of the Board of the Corporation in a non-voting, advisory capacity.

No more than one Class M Director shall be allocated to any single class of directors. Directors shall (except as hereinafter provided for the filling of vacancies and newly created directorships) be elected by the holders of a plurality of the votes

cast by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of such directors. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; , that a quorum shall not be constituted unless directors who are neither Class M Directors nor officers of the Corporation represent a majority of the directors present. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-Laws or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board. Directors need not be stockholders.
provided
Section 3. Subject to the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, unless otherwise required by law, any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office who are not Class M Directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director who is not a Class M Director; , that any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director if (a) the Board shall be comprised only of Class M Directors or (b) such newly created directorship or such vacancy relates to a Class M directorship. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship (other than a Class M directorship) at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes cast thereon by the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of directors (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include shares of Class M Common Stock), voting together as a single class. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a Class M directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes cast thereon by the outstanding shares of Class M Common Stock, voting separately as a class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.

In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, the By-Laws or the resolution of the Board designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
MasterCard International Incorporated (the "Company"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Registrant"), entered into employment agreements with Robert W. Selander on December 31, 2008 and with each of Noah Hanft, Chris McWilton and Martina Hund-Mejean (collectively with Mr. Selander, the "Executives") on December 30, 2008.
Each of the existing employment agreements for Messrs. Selander, Hanft and McWilton were amended and restated to, among other things, comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and integrate each original employment agreement with such Executive's respective Change in Control Agreement (and in Mr. Selander's case, an addendum to his original employment agreement as well), and each amended and restated employment agreement contains substantially the same terms as the original agreements, with the exception of certain changes highlighted below. Ms. Hund-Mejean's employment agreement replaces an offer letter of employment, dated October 5, 2007, previously provided by the Company in connection with Ms. Hund-Mejean joining the Company as its Chief Financial Officer.
Robert W. Selander
.
Term
Mr. Selander's amended and restated employment agreement provides for him to continue to be employed as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company for a fixed term until December 31, 2010 (the "CEO Term of Employment") unless terminated earlier or unless extended by mutual agreement. Previously, Mr. Selander's employment agreement provided for a perpetual term.
.
Duties
Mr. Selander will have duties customary and consistent with the position of CEO throughout the CEO Term of Employment. To implement a planned transition of Mr. Selander's position to any successor CEO, the Company would have the right to modify Mr. Selander's position; provided that such change would not be accompanied by a reduction in Mr. Selander's compensation, benefits or perquisite entitlements, or, prior to December 15, 2010, by a change in his status as a member of the Executive Committee and senior level executive of the Company.
.
Definitions
The definition of cause in Mr. Selander's employment agreement was revised to further clarify his role in providing assistance during any transition of his duties and responsibilities to a successor CEO. The definition of good reason was also amended to provide that a change in the position of Mr. Selander as a result of the implementation of the planned transition of Mr. Selander's position will not constitute a good reason event unless this change is accompanied by a reduction in Mr. Selander's compensation, benefits or perquisite entitlements, or prior to December 15, 2010, by a change in his status as a member of the Executive Committee and senior level executive of the Company. In addition, the definition of good reason was clarified to provide that a reduction in Mr. Selander's base salary of up to 10%, in the aggregate, over the CEO Term of Employment will not constitute a good reason event. Furthermore, Mr. Selander will be required to notify the Company of his decision to terminate his employment for good reason within 90 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a good reason event. If Mr. Selander fails to notify the Company of his intent to terminate his employment for good reason in the prescribed time, Mr. Selander will be deemed to have waived his right to terminate his employment for good reason.
 
Payments.
In addition to the payments described previously in the Company's public filings, the employment agreement was revised to provide that if Mr. Selander's employment is terminated due to death, disability, without cause, or for good reason, Mr. Selander or his estate, as applicable, will be entitled to receive an additional payment representing, to the extent not already paid, the annual incentive bonus for the year immediately preceding the year in which the termination of employment occurs, payable in the amount and at the time such bonus would have been paid had he remained employed.
Furthermore, the provision providing for the payment of a pro rata portion of Mr. Selander's annual incentive compensation for the year of termination upon his termination without cause or for good reason was clarified to comply with the new guidance promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code. Payment of the pro rata portion of his annual incentive compensation for the year of termination under these circumstances will only be made to Mr. Selander based on the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period as determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
The employment agreement was also amended to provide that, upon his termination for good reason or without cause, Mr. Selander's severance pay period will be shortened from a period of 36 months to the balance of the CEO Term of Employment. Furthermore, the employment agreement was amended to provide that, upon his termination for good reason or without cause, Mr. Selander will be deemed to have (i) retired under the MasterCard Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") with respect to all awards granted thereunder and (ii) remained an executive officer of the Company through December 31, 2010 for purposes of accrual of benefits and entitlements to certain contributions under the Company's compensation and benefit plans.
Finally, pursuant to his employment agreement, upon expiration of his CEO Term of Employment, Mr. Selander will now be entitled to receive his retention payment to the extent not paid, and his annual incentive compensation for 2010 based on the actual performance of the Company. Furthermore, upon expiration of the CEO Term of Employment, Mr. Selander will be deemed to have (i) retired under the LTIP with respect to all awards granted thereunder and (ii) remained an executive officer of the Company through December 31, 2010 for purposes of accrual of benefits and entitlements to certain contributions under the Company's compensation and benefit plans.
Integration of Change in Control Agreement and Retention Agreement.
Mr. Selander's employment agreement was amended to integrate his Change in Control Agreement and the addendum to his original employment agreement describing the requirements for a $10,000,000 retention payment to Mr. Selander. The retention payment provisions were revised to provide that the retention payment will be made upon the effective date of the Board's appointment of a successor CEO, or, if no such appointment has been made by December 31, 2010, within 30 days after December 31, 2010. Previously, Mr. Selander was required to, among other things, remain employed until a date set by the Board between April 9, 2010 and April 9, 2011 and provide required assistance in identifying his successor and transitioning his responsibilities to such person in order to be eligible to receive such retention payment.
Restrictive Covenants.
The restrictive covenants in Mr. Selander's employment agreement were revised as follows: (i) Mr. Selander's confidentiality obligations were shortened from a perpetual restriction to a 5-year post-termination restriction; and (ii) Mr. Selander's non-compete obligations were revised to conform them to the non-compete obligations under the LTIP.
 
Section 409A of the Code.
Mr. Selander's employment agreement was amended in many respects to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance promulgated thereunder.
Noah Hanft and Chris McWilton
.
Term
Pursuant to their employment agreements, Messrs. McWilton and Hanft will be employed as President, Global Accounts and General Counsel, Chief Franchise Officer & Corporate Secretary, respectively, for a period of two years (i.e., until December 30, 2010) with automatic one-year renewals unless the applicable Executive or the Company gives a 90-day written notice not to renew the employment agreement (the "Executive Term of Employment"). Previously, the employment agreements provided for a perpetual term.
.
Definitions
The employment agreements have been revised to provide that disability will have the meaning set forth in the MasterCard Long-Term Disability Benefits Plan. The definition of cause was also modified to identify additional policies that the Executives must not breach during their employment with the Company.
The definition of good reason was revised to require the Executives to notify the Company of their decision to terminate their employment for good reason within 60 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a good reason event. If the Executives fail to notify the Company of their intent to terminate their employment for good reason in the prescribed time, the Executives will be deemed to have waived their right to terminate their employment for good reason. In addition, the definition of good reason was amended to provide that a material reduction in the Executives' base salary will be needed to constitute a good reason event. However, the employment agreements clarify that a reduction of 10% in the aggregate over the Executive Term of Employment will not constitute a material reduction.
Termination.
The employment agreements were amended to provide that in the event of a voluntary resignation, the Company may decide to waive all or part of the 90-day written notice requirement. Unless waived, failure by the Executives to provide such written notice will render the Executives ineligible to receive certain payments upon their voluntary resignation. Furthermore, the employment agreements were revised to provide for mandatory retirement at age 65. As a result, the Executives' employment will be terminated on the last day of the calendar year in which the Executives attain age 65. Upon such termination of employment, the Executives will receive the same payments as they would have been entitled to receive prior to the amendment and restatement of their employment agreements in the event they were terminated for any reason after age 65.
Payments.
In addition to the payments described previously in the Company's public filings, the employment agreements were revised to provide that if the Executives' employments are terminated due to disability, the Executives will receive a pro rata portion of their target annual incentive bonus for the year of termination based on the number of completed months during that year rather than completed quarters. Furthermore, the provision providing for the payment of a pro rata portion of the annual incentive compensation for the year of termination upon the Executives' termination of employment without cause, for good reason or due to mandatory retirement was clarified to comply with the new
 
guidance promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code. Payment of the pro rata portion of the incentive annual compensation for the year of termination under these circumstances will only be made based on the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period as determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and the proration will be based on the completed months rather than quarters.
Because of the added concept of Executive Term of Employment, the employment agreements were revised to provide for certain types of payments upon non-renewal of the employment agreements. Consequently, the employment agreements provide that (i) upon non-renewal by the Executives, the Executives will be entitled to receive the same payments as the Executives would have received upon their voluntary resignation and (ii) upon non-renewal by the Company, the Executives will be entitled to receive the same payments as the Executives would have received upon termination of employment without cause or for good reason.
Mr. McWilton's employment agreement provides that if Mr. McWilton is not eligible for retiree health coverage after exhaustion of Company-paid COBRA medical coverage , the Company will reimburse him for the costs of medical coverage comparable to the costs of coverage of active members of the Executive Committee until Mr. McWilton reaches age 55 and thereafter if he is not eligible for retiree medical coverage through another employer, the Company will provide him with access to group medical coverage as if he had remained employed by the Company as an active employee and retired at age 55.
Finally, Mr. McWilton's employment agreement provides that if Mr. McWilton is terminated without cause, for good reason or upon non-renewal by the Company within four years of the earliest date he is eligible for retirement under the LTIP, Mr. McWilton will be deemed terminated by reason of retirement solely for the purposes of the LTIP.
Integration Change in Control Agreement.
The employment agreements were amended to integrate the Executives' Change in Control Agreements.
Restrictive Covenants.
The restrictive covenants in the employment agreements were revised as follows: (i) the non-compete obligations were revised to conform them to the non-compete obligations under the LTIP; and (ii) the Executives' option to reduce the length of their non-compete and non-solicitation restrictive periods by correspondingly voluntarily shortening their severance period was eliminated.
Section 409A of the Code.
The employment agreements were amended in many respects to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance promulgated
Martina Hund-Mejean

In the event of Ms. Hund-Mejean's termination by the Company without cause, by her with Good Reason or upon non-renewal of her agreement by the Company, she will be entitled to the following payments: (i) in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination all base salary earned but not paid prior to the date of termination; (ii) in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination equal to all accrued but unused vacation time; (iii) a pro-rata portion of the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which her termination occurs based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period and payable in accordance with the regular bonus pay practices of the Company and, to the extent not already paid, the annual incentive bonus for the year immediately preceding the year in which her date of termination occurs, payable in the amount and at the time it would have been paid had she remained employed; (iv) base salary continuation for 24 months following the date of termination; (v) a bonus payment for each of the succeeding two years with each bonus amount equivalent to the average annual bonus received by Ms. Hund-Mejean with respect to the prior two years of employment, payable in accordance with the annual incentive pay practices of the Company; (vi) payment of the monthly cost of the premium for COBRA medical coverage for the applicable COBRA period (or the severance period if shorter) or if she is eligible for the MasterCard Retiree Health Plan, the full cost of the Retiree Health coverage for the severance pay period and thereafter the retiree contribution levels shall apply; (vii) outplacement services; and (viii) such additional benefits, if any that she would be entitled to under the Company's plans and programs for the above captioned events of termination.

Entitlement to the payments described in items (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) above are subject to the execution (without revocation) within 60 days following the date of termination of a Separation Agreement and Release in the form attached to the agreement.
In the event Ms. Hund-Mejean's employment ends upon mandatory retirement (i.e., the last day of the calendar year in which she attains the age of sixty-five) she will be eligible for the following payments: (i) in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination all base salary earned but not paid prior to the date of termination; (ii) in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination equal to all accrued but unused vacation time; (iii) a pro-rata portion of the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which her termination occurs based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period and payable in accordance with the regular bonus pay practices of the Company; and (iv) such additional vested benefits which she is expressly entitled following the termination of her employment under the Company's plans and programs.
Mandatory Retirement.
Ms. Hund-Mejean's agreement provides for the payment of a gross up amount in the event any payments she may receive under the agreement are subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Excise Tax"). The Excise Tax is generally only payable on amounts which constitute parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code (generally defined as amounts payable in connection with a change in control of the Company). Under the gross-up provision Ms. Hund-Mejean would be entitled to receive an amount such that the net amount retained by her, taking into account the gross-up payment, and after deduction of federal, state and local income and employment taxes and excise taxes, shall equal the Excise Tax on the payments she receives (including amounts attributable to the receipt of the gross-up payment). The
Gross-Up Payments.
 
gross up provision however will not be applicable if the net value of the payments (taking into account the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes but not any gross-up amount) would be less than what she would have netted had the present value of her total payments in the event of a change in control been reduced by $1 below the maximum amount permitted to be received without triggering the Excise Tax under Section 280G of the Code and in such event her total payments would be reduced to such amount.
Entitlement to the gross-up payment described above is subject to execution (without revocation) within 60 days following the date of termination of a Separation Agreement and Release in the form attached to the agreement.
Under Ms. Hund-Mejean's original offer letter, she was awarded a one time cash sign on award of $1,225,000. Under the original terms of the offer letter, if she were to voluntarily leave employment with the Company or be terminated for Cause at any time prior to May 1, 2009, she would be required to repay the net amount received from the cash award (after lawful deductions) within 30 days of such date of termination. The agreement retains this requirement.
Repayment of Sign-on Award.
The agreement subjects Ms. Hund-Mejean to the Company's standard restrictive covenants for executive employees.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:
 
1.1 Commencing on the Effective Date, the Company agrees to continue to employ the Executive, and the Executive agrees to accept such continued employment and serve the Company, in such capacities, with such duties and authority, for such period, at such level of compensation and with such benefits, and upon such other terms and subject to such other conditions, as are hereinafter set forth.

Plan, the Company shall pay the full cost of such Retiree Health or COBRA coverage, as applicable, during the Severance Pay Period and thereafter, retiree contribution levels provided under the provisions of the Retiree Health Plan shall apply;

(f) be treated as if such termination were a "Retirement" as defined in the LTIP as in effect on the date hereof with respect to all awards granted to the Executive pursuant to the LTIP (or any successor plan) and outstanding at the time of such termination, without regard to whether such termination occurs before or after 6 months following the date of grant of the award and without regard to the ability of the "Committee" thereunder to alter such treatment; provided that if the Executive is entitled to more favorable treatment under the LTIP (or any successor plan) or any particular award agreement, such treatment shall apply;
(g) a pro rata portion of the Retention Payment, payable in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Paragraph 9.4; and
(h) such other payments, perquisites, and/or benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason, as may be provided by the then existing agreements, plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company (other than any severance payments payable under the terms of any benefit plan, including, but not limited to, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan.
5.2.6 . The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(g) are conditioned on the Executive or his legal representative's execution (without revocation) of a separation agreement and general release of claims ("Separation Agreement and Release") in substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A, provided that if the Executive should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(g).
Release
5.2.7 . If the Executive's employment terminates automatically upon the expiration of the Term of Employment in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.7 above, the Term of Employment shall end as of the Date of Termination and the Executive shall be entitled to:
Upon Expiration of the Term of Employment
(a) Base Salary earned but not paid prior to the Date of Termination, which shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination;

(g) such additional payments, perquisites, and/or benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment upon expiration of the Term of Employment, payable at such time as may be provided by the then existing agreements, plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company.
5.3 .
Change in Control
5.3.1 SERP. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control prior to the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall become fully vested in his SERP benefit, which shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the SERP.
 
5.3.2 .
Gross-Up Payments
(a) If any of the payments, perquisites, and/or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with his employment or termination thereof (whether such payments or benefits are provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries) (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive no later than the time such Excise Tax is required to be paid by the Executive or withheld by the Company, such additional amounts (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, taking into account the Gross-Up Payment, and after deduction of any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on such Gross-Up Payment and the Total Payments (calculated on a hypothetical basis by taking into account the provisions of Paragraph 5.3.2(b) hereof). Notwithstanding the above, if it is determined that the Excise Tax would cause the net after-tax Total Payments to be paid to or on behalf of the Executive to be less than what he would have netted, after federal, state and local income taxes without taking into account any Gross-Up Payment, had the present value of his Total Payments equaled one dollar ($1) less than three times his base amount, as defined under Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code, then the Executive's Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below the minimum possible amount), so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (the amount of the reduction is hereinafter referred to as the "Cut-Back Amount"). The Cut-Back Amount shall be achieved in such a manner so that the reduction of amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Executive is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two (2) economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis, but not below zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, Gross-Up Payments shall not be made earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.
(b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such payment, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by Tax Counsel in accordance with the principles
 
of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence or place of employment under which such amounts are subject to taxation, whichever is greater, in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(c) In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company within five (5) business days following the time that such difference is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in such Excise Tax or a federal, state and local income tax deduction) plus any interest received by the Executive on the amount of such repayment less any federal, state and local income and employment taxes actually paid by the Executive on such interest. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for any Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 5.3.2, any Gross-Up Payments shall be made no later than the last day of the taxable year following the year in which the Executive remits the related tax in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
5.4 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be entitled pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be entitled to any payment under Paragraph 5.2, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest
 
under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so. In addition, following a judicial determination of any such dispute, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award by the court requiring the non-prevailing party to pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Board of Directors has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may place the Executive on administrative leave from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Board of Directors to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such administrative leave, the Executive shall continue to be paid all compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Board of Directors' discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such administrative leave or suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Board of Directors. In the event the Executive is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of such charges, the Company shall pay to the Executive such compensation, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Company receives notice of such acquittal or exoneration, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any, all of which shall be paid and provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration.
 
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
 
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, for a period of five (5) years following the Executive's Date of Termination, he will keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. Subject to Section 6.2.2 below, if the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of any request or requirement to disclose information or
 
documents, or to participate, cooperate, or testify in any action as contemplated in this Section 6.2, the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any such request or requirement, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment and for the thirty-six (36) month period following the Date of Termination or in the event the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Paragraph 5.1.3 or 5.1.6, above, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Date of Termination, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i) VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or Visa Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
 
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and for the thirty-six (36) month period following the Date of Termination or in the event the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Paragraph 5.1.3 or 5.1.6, above, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 3 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 3 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(d) above during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any Severance Pay previously received from the Company.
 
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. He further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
 
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
 
The Company shall indemnify the Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for any acts or omissions taken or made by the Executive during the Term of Employment, within the scope of his authority under this Agreement.
 
9.1 In addition to any compensation due and owing the Executive pursuant to Paragraph 3 above (or, if applicable, Paragraph 5.2 above), subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of a release substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B, following the effective date of such release, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum payment of 10 million dollars ($10,000,000), less any payroll deductions required by law (hereinafter referred to as the "Retention Payment") as soon as reasonably practicable following, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following,
 
the Retention Date, in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, it being understood that for purposes of this Agreement, the term "Retention Date" shall mean the date on which the appointment of a successor CEO by the Board of Directors becomes effective; provided that if by December 31, 2010, no successor CEO has been appointed, or any such appointment is not effective, then December 31, 2010 shall be deemed the Retention Date. In the event a successor CEO is appointed prior to December 31, 2010, the Executive agrees to provide assistance, as reasonably requested in writing by the Board of Directors, in the process of transitioning the Executive's duties and responsibilities to the successor CEO through and including December 31, 2010. The Executive shall be entitled to such Retention Payment only if:
9.1.1 the Executive's employment has not been terminated prior to the Retention Date by the Company for Cause or by the Executive by submitting his Voluntary Resignation; and
9.1.2 the Company has achieved, on average, no less than target level performance, as determined by the Compensation Committee and measured under the SEAICP (or its equivalent under any predecessor or replacement plan), from and including 2004 through the Retention Date. (If performance is to be measured prior to December 31 of a given year, such partial year's performance shall be measured based upon the SEAICP forecasted score utilized by the corporate finance department for purposes of accruing SEAICP bonus expense for the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to such measurement date.)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the Retention Date, the Executive's employment is terminated due to the Executive's death or Disability or by the Company (for a reason other than death, Disability or Cause) or by the Executive for Good Reason, then such Retention Payment shall be reduced and paid in accordance with Paragraphs 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 below, as applicable. In each such case, for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in Section 9.1.2 is satisfied, target level performance shall be based, and actual performance shall be measured, through the Date of Termination.
9.2 In addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.1 above, in the event the Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Retention Date due to the Executive's death in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.1 the Executive's estate, subject to execution (without revocation) of a release by the legal representative of the Executive's estate in the form required by Paragraph 5.2.6 above, shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion (based upon completed calendar quarters worked between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010) of the Retention Payment described in Paragraph 9.1 above, payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Executive's death.
9.3 In addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.2 above, in the event the Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Retention Date due to Disability in accordance with the terms set forth in
 
Paragraph 5.1.2, the Executive, subject to execution (without revocation) of a Separation Agreement and Release by the Executive (or by the Executive's legal representative in the event the Executive is incapacitated and incapable of executing a Separation Agreement and Release) as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.6, shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion (based upon completed calendar quarters worked between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010) of the Retention Payment described in Paragraph 9.1 above, payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Executive's termination date due to Disability.
9.4 In addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.5 above, in the event the Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Retention Date by the Company (for a reason other than death, Disability or Cause), in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.4, or if the Executive terminates his employment with Good Reason in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.5, the Executive, subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of a Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.6, shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion (based upon completed calendar quarters worked between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010) of the Retention Payment described in Paragraph 9.1 above, payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Executive's termination date in accordance with this Paragraph 9.4.
 
10.1 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles of conflict of laws. Any legal suit, action or proceeding by or against any party hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the Separation Agreement and Release shall be instituted in a federal or state court in the State of New York, and each party hereto waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding and each party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding. In addition, following a judicial determination of any such legal suit, action or proceeding, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award by the court requiring the non-prevailing party to pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the legal suit, action or proceeding.
10.2 The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is and will be bound to the terms of the Company's Code of Conduct, Supplemental Code of Conduct and any other agreements he has executed or may execute in the future regarding confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions restrictions on competition, solicitation or which create other post-employment obligations, including, but not limited to any agreement executed in connection with the Executive's past or future participation in the Company's LTIP.
 
10.3 Upon the Effective Date, this Agreement between the Executive and the Company, shall incorporate the complete understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company or any predecessor thereof, with respect to such subject matter.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination for Good Reason in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(f) and 5.2.7(b)-(j). For purposes of this Agreement "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence at any time of any of the following without the Executive's prior written consent:
(a) the assignment to a position for which the Executive is not qualified or a materially lesser position than the position held by the Executive (although duties may differ without giving rise to a termination by the Executive for Good Reason);

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination by Voluntary Resignation in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.4(c).
5.1.7 if within sixty (60) days subsequent to the termination of the Executive's employment for death, Disability, Good Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that the Executive could have been terminated for Cause hereunder, such voluntary termination shall be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to the Company. Thereafter, the Company may take appropriate legal action to seek recompense for any payments or benefits improperly paid to the Executive, his estate or beneficiaries hereunder. Following a judicial determination, the prevailing party in any action under this Paragraph 5.1.7, shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1.7.

(b) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(g), severance pay, in the form of Base Salary continuation and payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan), of an amount equivalent to the average annual incentive bonus received by the Executive with respect to the prior two years of the Executive's employment by the Company (the "Average Bonus Payment"), payable on a schedule in accordance with the regular payroll practices (but in no event less frequently than monthly) and annual incentive bonus pay practices of the Company (such Base Salary continuation and Average Bonus Payment being collectively referred to herein as "Severance Pay") for a twenty-four (24) month period following the Executive's Date of Termination (the "Severance Pay Period"). Each such installment payment shall be deemed a separate payment for Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, payments of the Severance Pay shall commence no earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination (or such earlier date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code) (with the first such payment being a lump sum equal to the aggregate payments the Executive would have received during such six-month period if no such delay had been imposed) in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code; provided that, to the extent such amounts do not exceed two (2) times the lesser of: (i) the Executive's Base Salary for the year preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in this Section 5.2.5(b) without regard to such six (6) month delay. In the event that the Executive dies prior to receipt of all Severance Pay due hereunder, any remaining Severance Pay due to the Executive under this Paragraph 5.2.5(b) shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Executive's death but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the date of the Executive's death; provided that, in accordance with the transition relief set forth in IRS Notice 2007-86, in the event that prior to January 1, 2009, (i) the Executive becomes entitled to Severance Pay pursuant to this Section 5.2.5(b) and (ii) the Executive's death occurs, then any amounts of Severance Pay which become payable on or prior to December 31, 2008 shall be paid in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company, but no less frequently than monthly, and any remaining Severance Pay shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum on January 2, 2009;

(e) the Executive shall become fully vested in his benefit in the MasterCard International Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") upon the earliest of (i) the termination of the Executive's employment without Cause or with Good Reason as defined herein, subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(g) and (ii) a Change in Control. Such SERP benefit shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the SERP;
(f) such other benefits, if any, to which the Executive is expressly eligible following the termination of the Executive's employment by the Company without Cause, by the Executive with Good Reason or by the Company Upon Non-Renewal, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company.

(d) such additional vested benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company, provided, however, in no event shall the Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.5(b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
5.2.7
Gross-Up Payments.
(a) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(g), if any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with his employment or termination thereof (whether such payments or benefits are provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries) (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive no later than the time such Excise Tax is required to be paid by the Executive or withheld by the Company, such additional amounts (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, taking into account the Gross-Up Payment, and after deduction of any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on such Gross-Up Payment and the Total Payments (calculated on a hypothetical basis by taking into account the provisions of Paragraph 5.2.7(b) hereof). Notwithstanding the above, if it is determined that the Excise Tax would cause the net after-tax Total Payments to be paid to or on behalf of the Executive to be less than what he would have netted, after federal, state and local income taxes without taking into account any Gross-Up Payment, had the present value of his Total Payments equaled one dollar ($1) less than three times his base amount, as defined under Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code, then the Executive's Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below the minimum possible amount), so that no
 
portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (the amount of the reduction is hereinafter referred to as the "Cut-Back Amount"). The Cut-Back Amount shall be achieved in such a manner so that the reduction of amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Executive is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two (2) economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis, but not below zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, Gross-Up Payments shall not be made earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.
(b) for purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such payment, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by Tax Counsel in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence or place of employment under which such amounts are subject to taxation, whichever is greater, in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(c) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(g), in the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to be less than the amount
 
taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company within five (5) business days following the time that such difference is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in such Excise Tax or a federal, state and local income tax deduction) plus any interest received by the Executive on the amount of such repayment less any federal, state and local income and employment taxes actually paid by the Executive on such interest. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for any Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 5.2.7, any Gross-Up Payments shall be made no later than the last day of the taxable year following the year in which the Executive remits the related tax in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the
 
premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated from such charges, the Company shall pay to the Executive such compensation, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Company receives notice from the Executive of such acquittal or exoneration, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any, all of which shall be paid and provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration from criminal charges that resulted in his suspension shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.
 
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality.
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers,
 
whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 above, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the
 
benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i) VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or Visa Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
 
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)(d) above, during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any Severance Pay previously received from the Company. In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
 
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. He further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
 
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
 
The Company shall indemnify the Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for any acts or omissions taken or made by the Executive during the Term of Employment, within the scope of his authority under this Agreement.
 
9.1 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles of conflict of laws. Any legal suit, action or proceeding by or against any party hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the Separation Agreement and Release shall be instituted in a federal or state court in the State of New York, and each party hereto waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding and each party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding.
9.2 The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is and will be bound to the terms of the Company's Code of Conduct, Supplemental Code of Conduct and any other agreements he has executed or may execute in the future regarding confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions restrictions on competition, solicitation or which create other post-employment obligations, including, but not limited to any agreement executed in connection with the Executive's past or future participation in the Company's LTIP.
 
9.3 Upon the Effective Date, this Agreement shall incorporate the complete understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company or any predecessor thereof, with respect to such subject matter. No provision hereof may be modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the Executive and the Company.
9.4 The Executive acknowledges that before entering into this Agreement he has received a reasonable period of time to consider this Agreement and has had sufficient time and an opportunity to consult with any attorney or other advisor of his choice in connection with this Agreement and all matters contained herein, and that he has been advised to do so if he so chooses. The Executive further acknowledges that this Agreement and all terms hereof are fair, reasonable and are not the result of any fraud, duress, coercion, pressure or undue influence exercised by the Company, that he has approved and entered into this Agreement and all of the terms hereof on his own free will, and that no promises or representations have been made to him by any person to induce him to enter into this Agreement other than the express terms set forth herein.

Either party may change the address to which any notices to it shall be sent by giving to the other party written notice of such change in conformity with the foregoing.
9.8 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
9.9 This Agreement may be assigned by the Company to, and shall inure to the benefit of, any successor to substantially all the assets and business of the Company as a going concern, whether by merger, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, provided that such successor shall assume the Company's obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
9.10 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Executive in connection with his employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Executive during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Executive dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Executive's beneficiary within thirty (30) days of the Executive's death.
9.11 This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, specifically, with the separation pay exemption and short term deferral exemption of Section 409A, and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption. All
 
payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A.

In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and Release shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement and General Release, as applicable), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination for Good Reason in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(f) and 5.2.7(b)-(j). For purposes of this Agreement "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence at any time of any of the following without the Executive's prior written consent:
(a) the assignment to a position for which the Executive is not qualified or a materially lesser position than the position held by the Executive (although duties may differ without giving rise to a termination by the Executive for Good Reason);
(b) a material reduction in the Executive's annual Base Salary except that a 10 percent reduction, in the aggregate, over the Term of Employment as set forth in Section 3.1 hereof shall not be treated as a material reduction;
(c) the relocation of the Executive's principal place of employment to a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Executive's principal place of employment (unless such relocation does not increase the Executive's commute by more than twenty (20) miles), except for required travel on the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with the Executive's business travel obligations as of the date of relocation; or
 
(d) the failure by the Company to obtain an agreement from any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform any employment agreement between the Executive and the Company.
5.1.6 at the option of the Executive, effective ninety (90) days after the giving of written notice to the Company of the exercise of such option for a reason other than Good Reason as set forth in Paragraph 5.1.5, above ("Voluntary Resignation"). The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination by Voluntary Resignation in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.4(c).
5.1.7 if within sixty (60) days subsequent to the termination of the Executive's employment for death, Disability, Good Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that the Executive could have been terminated for Cause hereunder, such voluntary termination shall be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to the Company. Thereafter, the Company may take appropriate legal action to seek recompense for any payments or benefits improperly paid to the Executive, his estate or beneficiaries hereunder. Following a judicial determination, the prevailing party in any action under this Paragraph 5.1.7, shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1.7.
5.1.8 on the last day of the calendar year in which the Executive attains the age of sixty-five (65) ("Mandatory Retirement"), at which time the Executive shall be required to retire.
5.2 .

(b) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(i), severance pay, in the form of Base Salary continuation and payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan), of an amount equivalent to the average annual incentive bonus received by the Executive with respect to the prior two years of the Executive's employment by the Company (the "Average Bonus Payment"), payable on a schedule in accordance with the regular payroll practices (but in no event less frequently than monthly) and annual incentive bonus pay practices of the Company (such Base Salary continuation and Average Bonus Payment being collectively referred to herein as "Severance Pay") for a twenty-four (24) month period following the Executive's Date of Termination (the "Severance Pay Period"). Each such installment payment shall be deemed a separate payment for Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, payments of the Severance Pay shall commence no earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination (or such earlier date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code) (with the first such payment being a lump sum equal to the aggregate payments the Executive would have received during such six-month period if no such delay had been imposed) in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code; provided that, to the extent such amounts do not exceed two (2) times the lesser of: (i) the Executive's Base Salary for the year preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in this Section 5.2.5(b) without regard to such six (6) month delay. In the event that the Executive dies prior to receipt of all Severance Pay due hereunder, any remaining Severance Pay due to the Executive under this Paragraph 5.2.5(b) shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Executive's death but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the date of the Executive's death; provided that, in accordance with the transition relief set forth in IRS Notice 2007-86, in the event that prior to January 1, 2009, (i) the Executive becomes entitled to Severance Pay pursuant to this Section 5.2.5(b) and (ii) the Executive's death occurs, then any amounts of Severance Pay which become payable on or prior to December 31, 2008 shall be paid in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company, but no less frequently than monthly, and any remaining Severance Pay shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum on January 2, 2009;
(c) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(i), payment on the Executive's behalf, for the monthly cost of the premiums for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), for a period equivalent to the eighteen (18) month COBRA period (twenty-nine (29) month period, if the Executive is disabled under the Social Security Act within the first sixty (60) days of the continuation period) or the Severance Pay Period, whichever is shorter (the "Medical Benefits"), provided, however, such coverage shall not be provided if during such period the Executive is or becomes ineligible under the provisions of COBRA for continuing
 
coverage; and provided, further, that if the Executive is eligible for Retiree Health Coverage under the MasterCard Retiree Health Plan, the Company shall pay the full cost of such Retiree Health or COBRA coverage, as applicable, during the Severance Pay Period and thereafter, retiree contribution levels provided under the provisions of the Retiree Health Plan shall apply;

(e) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5 (i), reasonable outplacement services, to be provided by a firm selected by the Company, at a level generally made available to executives of the Company for the shorter of the Severance Pay Period or the period he remains unemployed;

Such SERP benefit shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the SERP;
(g) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(i), in the event the Executive's Date of Termination is within four (4) years of the earliest date on which Executive is eligible for Retirement under the MasterCard Incorporated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time ("LTIP"), Executive shall be deemed terminated by reason of Retirement solely for purposes of the LTIP and any grant awards made thereunder.

(i) The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(f)(i), and (g) and 5.2.7 (a) and (c) are conditioned on the Executive or his legal representative's execution (without revocation) of a separation agreement and general release of claims ("Separation Agreement and Release") in substantially the form annexed hereto, provided that if the Executive should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(f)(i) and (g) and 5.2.7 (a) and (c).
5.2.6 . In the event the Executive's employment with the Company ends upon Mandatory Retirement, the Executive shall be eligible for the following lump sum payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan) as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination:

(b) payment for all accrued but unused vacation time up to the Date of Termination;
(c) a pro rata portion (based upon actually completed calendar months worked ) of the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs and the prior year, if not already paid, based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period (and taking into account the terms of the Plan including but not limited to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to reduce such bonus amount) as contemplated in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, with such amount payable when the incentive bonus is regularly paid to similarly situated employees for such year; and
(d) such additional vested benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company, provided, however, in no event shall the Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.5(b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
5.2.7
Gross-Up Payments.
(a) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(i), if any of the
 
payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with his employment or termination thereof (whether such payments or benefits are provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries) (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive no later than the time such Excise Tax is required to be paid by the Executive or withheld by the Company, such additional amounts (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, taking into account the Gross-Up Payment, and after deduction of any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on such Gross-Up Payment and the Total Payments (calculated on a hypothetical basis by taking into account the provisions of Paragraph 5.2.7(b) hereof). Notwithstanding the above, if it is determined that the Excise Tax would cause the net after-tax Total Payments to be paid to or on behalf of the Executive to be less than what he would have netted, after federal, state and local income taxes without taking into account any Gross-Up Payment, had the present value of his Total Payments equaled one dollar ($1) less than three times his base amount, as defined under Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code, then the Executive's Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below the minimum possible amount), so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (the amount of the reduction is hereinafter referred to as the "Cut-Back Amount"). The Cut-Back Amount shall be achieved in such a manner so that the reduction of amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Executive is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two (2) economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis, but not below zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, Gross-Up Payments shall not be made earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.
(b) for purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such payment, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by Tax Counsel in accordance with the principles
 
of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence or place of employment under which such amounts are subject to taxation, whichever is greater, in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(c) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(i), in the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company within five (5) business days following the time that such difference is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in such Excise Tax or a federal, state and local income tax deduction) plus any interest received by the Executive on the amount of such repayment less any federal, state and local income and employment taxes actually paid by the Executive on such interest. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for any Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 5.2.7, any Gross-Up Payments shall be made no later than the last day of the taxable year following the year in which the Executive remits the related tax in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
 
jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated from such charges, the Company shall pay to the Executive such compensation, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Company receives notice from the Executive of such acquittal or exoneration, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any, all of which shall be paid and provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration from criminal charges that resulted in his suspension shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.
 
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
 
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality.
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or
 
before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 above, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i) VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or Visa Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable,
 
then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)(g) above, during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial
 
determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any Severance Pay previously received from the Company. In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. He further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
 
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
 
The Company shall indemnify the Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for any acts or omissions taken or made by the Executive during the Term of Employment, within the scope of his authority under this Agreement.
 
9.1 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles of conflict of laws. Any legal suit, action or proceeding by or against any party hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the Separation Agreement and Release shall be instituted in a federal or state court in the State of New York, and each party hereto waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding and each party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding.
9.2 The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is and will be bound to the terms of the Company's Code of Conduct, Supplemental Code of Conduct and any other agreements he has executed or may execute in the future regarding confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions restrictions on competition, solicitation or which create other post-employment obligations, including, but not limited to any agreement executed in connection with the Executive's past or future participation in the Company's LTIP.
9.3 Upon the Effective Date, this Agreement shall incorporate the complete understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company or any predecessor thereof, with respect to such subject matter. No provision hereof may be modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the Executive and the Company.
9.4 The Executive acknowledges that before entering into this Agreement he has received a reasonable period of time to consider this Agreement and has had sufficient time and an opportunity to consult with any attorney or other advisor of his choice in connection with this Agreement and all matters contained herein, and that he has been advised to do so if he so chooses. The Executive further acknowledges that this Agreement and all terms hereof are fair, reasonable and are not the result of any fraud, duress, coercion, pressure or undue influence exercised by the Company, that he has approved and entered into this Agreement and all of the terms hereof on his own free will, and that no promises or representations have been made to him by any person to induce him to enter into this Agreement other than the express terms set forth herein.

Either party may change the address to which any notices to it shall be sent by giving to the other party written notice of such change in conformity with the foregoing.
9.8 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
9.9 This Agreement may be assigned by the Company to, and shall inure to the benefit of, any successor to substantially all the assets and business of the Company as a going concern, whether by merger, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, provided that such successor shall assume the Company's obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
9.10 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Executive in connection with his employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified
 
deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Executive during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Executive dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Executive's beneficiary within thirty (30) days of the Executive's death.
9.11 This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, specifically, with the separation pay exemption and short term deferral exemption of Section 409A, and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and Release shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement and General Release, as applicable), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination by Voluntary Resignation in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.4(c).
5.1.7 if within sixty (60) days subsequent to the termination of the Executive's employment for death, Disability, Good Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that the Executive could have been terminated for Cause hereunder, such voluntary termination shall be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to the Company. Thereafter, the Company may take appropriate legal action to seek recompense for any payments or benefits improperly paid to the Executive, her estate or beneficiaries hereunder. Following a judicial determination, the prevailing party in any action under this Paragraph 5.1.7, shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1.7.
5.1.8 on the last day of the calendar year in which the Executive attains the age of sixty-five (65) ("Mandatory Retirement"), at which time the Executive shall be required to retire.

(b) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(f), severance pay, in the form of Base Salary continuation and payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan), of an amount equivalent to the average annual incentive bonus received by the Executive with respect to the prior two years of the Executive's employment by the Company (the "Average Bonus Payment"), payable on a schedule in accordance with the regular payroll practices (but in no event less frequently than monthly) and annual incentive bonus pay practices of the Company (such Base Salary continuation and Average Bonus Payment being collectively referred to herein as "Severance Pay") for a twenty-four (24) month period following the Executive's Date of Termination (the "Severance Pay Period"). Each such installment payment shall be deemed a separate payment for Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, payments of the Severance Pay shall commence no earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination (or such earlier date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code)(with the first such payment being a lump sum equal to the aggregate payments the Executive would have received during such six-month period if no such delay had been imposed) in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code; provided that, to the extent such amounts do not exceed two (2) times the lesser of: (i) the Executive's Base Salary for the year preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in this Section 5.2.5(b) without regard to such six (6) month delay. In the event that the Executive dies prior to receipt of all Severance Pay due hereunder, any remaining Severance Pay due to the Executive under this Paragraph 5.2.5(b) shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Executive's death but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the date of the Executive's death; provided that, in accordance with the transition relief set forth in IRS Notice 2007-86, in the event that prior to January 1, 2009, (i) the Executive becomes entitled to Severance Pay pursuant to this Section 5.2.5(b) and (ii) the Executive's death occurs, then any amounts of Severance Pay which become payable on or prior to December 31, 2008 shall be paid in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company, but no less frequently than monthly, and any remaining Severance Pay shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum on January 2, 2009;

the continuation period) or the Severance Pay Period, whichever is shorter (the "Medical Benefits"), provided, however, such coverage shall not be provided if during such period the Executive is or becomes ineligible under the provisions of COBRA for continuing coverage; and provided, further, that if the Executive is eligible for Retiree Health Coverage under the MasterCard Retiree Health Plan, the Company shall pay the full cost of such Retiree Health or COBRA coverage, as applicable, during the Severance Pay Period and thereafter, retiree contribution levels provided under the provisions of the Retiree Health Plan shall apply;
(d) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5 (f), reasonable outplacement services, to be provided by a firm selected by the Company, at a level generally made available to executives of the Company for the shorter of the Severance Pay Period or the period she remains unemployed;
(e) such other benefits, if any, to which the Executive is expressly eligible following the termination of the Executive's employment by the Company without Cause, by the Executive with Good Reason or by the Company Upon Non-Renewal, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company. (other than any severance payments payable under the terms of any benefit plan, including, but not limited to, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan).
(f) The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(d) are conditioned on the Executive or her legal representative's execution (without revocation) of a separation agreement and general release of claims ("Separation Agreement and Release") in substantially the form annexed hereto, provided that if the Executive should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(d).
5.2.6 . In the event the Executive's employment with the Company ends upon Mandatory Retirement, the Executive shall be eligible for the following lump sum payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan) as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination:

(b) payment for all accrued but unused vacation time up to the Date of Termination;
 
(c) a pro rata portion (based upon actually completed calendar months worked ) of the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs and the prior year, if not already paid, based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period (and taking into account the terms of the Plan including but not limited to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to reduce such bonus amount) as contemplated in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, with such amount payable when the incentive bonus is regularly paid to similarly situated employees for such year; and
(d) such additional vested benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company, provided, however, in no event shall the Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.5(b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
5.2.7
Gross-Up Payments.
(a) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(f), if any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with her employment or termination thereof (whether such payments or benefits are provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries) (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive no later than the time such Excise Tax is required to be paid by the Executive or withheld by the Company, such additional amounts (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, taking into account the Gross-Up Payment, and after deduction of any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on such Gross-Up Payment and the Total Payments (calculated on a hypothetical basis by taking into account the provisions of Paragraph 5.2.7(b) hereof). Notwithstanding the above, if it is determined that the Excise Tax would cause the net after-tax Total Payments to be paid to or on behalf of the Executive to be less than what he would have netted, after federal, state and local income taxes without taking into account any Gross-Up Payment, had the present value of her Total Payments equaled one dollar ($1) less than three times her base amount, as defined under Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code, then the Executive's Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below the minimum possible amount), so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (the amount of the reduction is hereinafter referred to as the "Cut-Back Amount"). The Cut-Back Amount shall be achieved in such a manner so that the reduction of amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Executive is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two (2) economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis, but not below zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code,
 
Gross-Up Payments shall not be made earlier than the first day of the seventh month following the Executive's Date of Termination in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.
(b) for purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such payment, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by Tax Counsel in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence or place of employment under which such amounts are subject to taxation, whichever is greater, in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(c) subject to the Executive's execution (without revocation) of the Separation Agreement and Release, as set forth in Paragraph 5.2.5(g), in the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company within five (5) business days following the time that such difference is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in such Excise Tax or a federal, state and local income tax deduction) plus any interest received by the Executive on the amount of such repayment less any federal, state and local income and employment taxes
 
actually paid by the Executive on such interest. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for any Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 5.2.7, any Gross-Up Payments shall be made no later than the last day of the taxable year following the year in which the Executive remits the related tax in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated from such charges, the Company shall pay to the Executive such compensation, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Company receives notice from the Executive of such acquittal or exoneration, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any all of which shall be paid and provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration from criminal charges that resulted in her suspension shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
 
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.
 
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that she has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of her employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, she will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential
 
Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into her possession, and that she will not use the same for her own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that she will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, she shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and she shall exercise her best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by her for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 above, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for herself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i) VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal,
 
Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or Visa Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.3 or 5.2.4 for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not herself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole
 
and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached her obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)(d) above, during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached her obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any Severance Pay previously received from the Company. In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by her of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. She further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.

They are: Richard Hartzell, Latin America and the Caribbean; Javier Perez, Europe; Andre Sekulic, Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa; and, Kevin Stanton, Canada.
Recognizing the importance of the "franchisor" component of its business model and the need for a strategic and customer-aligned approach to issues facing the franchise, the company has tapped Wendy Murdock, 56, to lead both Payment System Integrity and Franchise Development, reporting to Noah Hanft, 56, General Counsel and Chief Payment System Integrity & Compliance Officer. In her new role as Chief Franchise Officer, Ms. Murdock will be responsible for ensuring that these key functions are managed in a coordinated and strategic fashion. Previously, she was Chief Product Officer.
Under the continuing leadership of Gary Flood, 50, President, Global Products & Solutions, the company will provide greater alignment between product development and international and U.S. markets. Products & Solutions Regional Lead roles will be established to share regional objectives and help drive go-to-market disciplines, integrated solutions, resource

Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.2 billion, a 14.2% increase versus the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations (driven by movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) tempered net revenue growth by 3.5 percentage points for the quarter. The higher net revenue in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2007 was fueled by:
 
 
MasterCard's gross dollar volume increased 3.4%, on a local currency basis, to $605 billion. Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter rose 3.1% on a local currency basis, versus the fourth quarter of 2007, to $455 billion, driven by modest growth in cardholder spending on a growing number of MasterCard cards. As of December 31, 2008, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 981 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 7.6% over the cards issued at December 31, 2007.

"Despite the significant economic turbulence around the world, we were able to achieve excellent fourth-quarter operating results while maintaining a healthy balance sheet, which is a strength in this environment," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Our 2008 full-year results reflect our unique business model and the value we provide to our financial-institution customers around the world."
Selander stated, "We remain committed to taking a prudent approach to our business to ensure effective cost management, while opportunistically investing to drive long-term growth for MasterCard and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Our recent organizational realignment and our acquisition of Orbiscom, a leading payments solutions software provider, reflect that approach."
"The economic environment remains challenging, with businesses, governments and consumers around the world rethinking how finances are managed. One thing is certain in this new reality of increased financial management control  the value and importance of electronic payments has never been greater," concluded Selander.
The special item for the fourth quarter of 2008 represented:
 
There were no special items for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses decreased 16.0%, to $756 million, during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Currency fluctuations of 2.0 percentage points contributed to the rate of decline for total operating expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including the special item, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 15.3% versus the year-ago period, to $762 million.
Excluding the special item, the operating margin was 38.2% for the fourth quarter of 2008, up 22.2 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including the special item, the operating margin was 37.7% for the fourth quarter of 2008.
Total other expense was $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus total other income of $295 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to gains
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. Interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $21 million, primarily due to the interest accretion associated with the American Express settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2008.
Excluding the special item, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 46.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008, versus 34.9% in the comparable period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to deferred tax remeasurement and increased FIN 48 tax reserves. Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 46.2% for the fourth quarter of 2008.
Full-Year 2008 Results
For the year-ended December 31, 2008, MasterCard reported net income of $1.2 billion, or $9.45 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items, and a net loss of $254 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, including special items. Both earnings per share figures include after-tax gains from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. of $0.42 per share on a diluted basis.
Special items on a pre-tax basis for the full-year 2008 included:
 
 
 
 
Special items on a pre-tax basis for full-year 2007 included:
 
 
Net revenue for full-year 2008 was $5.0 billion, a 22.7% increase versus 2007. In addition to growth in GDV, processed transactions and cross-border transaction volumes, this increase was driven by pricing changes of approximately 6 percentage points, primarily associated with the cross-border transaction pricing implemented in 2008. Currency fluctuation contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of the increase in revenue.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 4
 
Excluding special items for both periods, total operating expenses increased 2.9%, to $3.0 billion, for full-year 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to higher personnel expenses. Currency fluctuations contributed 1.7 percentage points of this increase. Growth in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including special items, operating expenses increased 86.7%, to $5.5 billion.
Excluding special items, the operating margin was 39.0% for full-year 2008, up 11.7 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including special items, the operating margin was a negative 10.7% for full-year 2008.
Total other income was $76 million for full-year 2008 versus $473 million for the same period in 2007, excluding special items in both periods. Other income decreased due to larger gains recorded in 2007 from the sale of Redecard securities. Additionally, interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $46 million, primarily due to the interest accretion associated with the 2008 American Express settlement. Including special items, total other income was $151 million for full-year 2008 and $563 million for full-year 2007.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding litigation settlements, was 38.7% for the full-year 2008, versus a rate of 35.0% for the full-year 2007. The increase was primarily due to deferred tax remeasurement and increased FIN 48 tax reserves. Including the litigation settlements, the effective tax rate was 33.7% for 2008 and 35.0% for 2007.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

As part of a review of its presentation of certain of its financial information, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") today stated that it will: (1) modify its presentation of details of the Company's major revenue categories included within the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the "MD&A") section of future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and (2) reclassify certain cardholder-related enhancement expenses. In each case, the Company's intent is to better align such information with the way in which management views the underlying drivers of the business and analyzes the Company's results of operations.
The modifications to the presentation within the MD&A of the detail of the Company's revenue categories will not result in any changes to the Company's historical financial statements and will have no effect on the overall calculation of net revenue presented in future financial statements. The reclassification of certain cardholder-related enhancement expenses will not result in any impact to the Company's overall operating expenses.
Prospectively, the Company will report information regarding the composition of its net revenues within the MD&A using the following four major revenue categories and one combined contra-revenue line:
 
 
 
 
 
A more detailed description of these categories is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. An explanation of the changes from the historical to modified presentation of revenue streams is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. Both of these exhibits are incorporated herein by reference.
Cardholder-related enhancement expenses, which were previously classified as advertising and marketing expenses, will now be included in general and administrative expenses. These cardholder benefit program expenses, such as insurance and card replacements, were previously deemed promotional features of the cards and over time have become standard product offerings in certain card categories.
The historical presentation in the Company's SEC filings will be modified prospectively to conform to the new presentation, beginning with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. For reference, historical financial information regarding the details of the Company's revenue categories and the expense reclassifications on a quarterly basis for each of 2008, 2007 and 2006 are available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website: .

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter 2009. The company reported net income of $367 million, or $2.80 per diluted share.
Purchase, NY, May 1, 2009
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was $1.2 billion, a 2.2% decline versus the same period in 2008. The decline in net revenue growth was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and higher rebates and incentives, partially offset by pricing, increased processed transactions and increases in other payment-related services. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 1.8% compared to the same period in 2008.
MasterCard's gross dollar volume was up 0.3%, on a local currency basis, versus the first quarter of 2008, to $550 billion. Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was also up 0.3% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2008, to $411 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 5.8% compared to the same period in 2008, to 5.1 billion. As of March 31, 2009, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 967 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 4.0% over the cards issued at March 31, 2008.
"As we navigate through these challenging economic times, we've taken important steps to better align our operations with the current environment," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "We've taken considerable cost-reduction actions allowing us to deliver a strong operating margin of 48.6%, while keeping focused to ensure MasterCard is well positioned for long-term growth.
"As we move forward," Selander added, "we're maintaining a flexible and adaptable approach to ensure we continue to deliver value to our customers. Whether through the innovative products and solutions we offer, or our unmatched advisory and information services, we're making payments easier and more efficient for everyone involved."
Total operating expenses decreased 10.8%, to $595 million, during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Currency fluctuations contributed 2.9 percentage points to the rate of decline. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
The operating margin was 48.6% for the first quarter of 2009, up 5.0 percentage points over the year-ago period.
Total other expense was $11 million in the first quarter of 2009 versus total other income of $173 million in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to gains realized in the first quarter of 2008 from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. Interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $20 million, primarily due to the interest accretion associated with a litigation settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2008.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 33.2% in the first quarter of 2009, versus 35.1% in the comparable period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to an adjustment of deferred taxes.
There were no special items for the first quarter of 2009. The special item for the first quarter of 2008 related to a $75 million pre-tax gain from the termination of a customer business agreement. The company's total other income, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying GAAP Reconciliations.

The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Restrictive Covenants
The Agreement subjects Mr. Banga to the Company's standard restrictive covenants for executive employees, including confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicit obligations. However, Mr. Banga's covenant not to compete is narrower with respect to entities covered by the provision if he terminates employment with Good Reason due to the failure by the Company to offer him a promotion to Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before June 30, 2010 (with such offer to become effective not later than January 1, 2011).
 
Repayment of Sign-on Award.
Under the terms of the Offer Letter, Mr. Banga is to receive a "sign-on" award of $4,200,000 payable in two equal installments. The first installment is to be paid within 30 days of commencement of employment with the Company and the second installment is to be paid in 2010, not later than 30 days after the first anniversary of the date on which his employment commenced. These payments are contingent upon Mr. Banga's continued performance of services through such date; provided, however, that if Mr. Banga's employment is terminated with Good Reason due to the failure by the Company to offer Mr. Banga a promotion to Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before June 30, 2010 (with such offer to become effective not later than January 1, 2011), then he will nevertheless be entitled to the entire sign-on award. Under the terms of the Offer Letter, Mr. Banga is obligated to return the net amount received in the first installment if his employment is terminated for Cause within 12 months of the date of commencement of employment or upon his voluntary resignation prior to the time that the Company has made a decision concerning his potential appointment to Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Banga is obligated to return the net amount received in the second installment if his employment is terminated for Cause within 12 months of the date the second installment is received or if he voluntarily resigns within 12 months of the date the second installment is received.
Incentive Awards and Other Benefits
Upon commencement of employment with the Company, Mr. Banga will be eligible to participate in the SEAICP. This bonus program is based on corporate, business unit and individual performance. His target pay out will be 150% (range 0% - 375%) of his base salary. Bonus amounts are based upon an assessment of results against established performance goals. Receipt of any bonus payment is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Banga's 2009 bonus opportunity will not be prorated.
Mr. Banga will also be eligible to participate in the 2006 MasterCard Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"). In 2009, Mr. Banga will receive grants with the following vesting schedule, in each case contingent on continued service:
 
20% vests 12 months after the grant date;
20% vests 24 months after the grant date; and
the balance of 60% vests 36 months after the grant date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mr. Banga terminates his employment with Good Reason due to the failure by the Company to offer Mr. Banga a promotion to Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before June 30, 2010 (with such offer to become effective not later than January 1, 2011) , this grant of restricted stock units will continue to vest without regard to such termination and will not be forfeited.
 
the first one-third vests 6 months after the grant date;
the second one-third vests 18 months after the grant date; and
the final one-third vests 30 months after the grant date.
 
If Mr. Banga terminates his employment after any or all of such stock options have vested, but prior to becoming retirement eligible in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan, he will have 120 days following the termination date to exercise the vested options. Any unvested portion of such stock options will be forfeited.
Mr. Banga will also receive a 2010 standard award under the Stock Plan, valued at $4,400,000. This award is expected to be equally split between non-qualified stock options and performance stock units (at the discretion of the Compensation Committee).
Mr. Banga will be eligible to participate in the Company's US Profit Sharing Program after one year of employment with the Company. The US Profit Sharing Program may result, depending on the Company's financial performance for the year, in an annual payment ranging from 0-10% of Mr. Banga's base salary for the portion of 2010 that he is eligible to participate in the program.
Mr. Banga also will be eligible to participate in the Company's executive perquisite program in accordance with the terms and conditions of such program, as approved by the Compensation Committee. In accordance with the Company's policy for providing perquisite allowances in lieu of specific perquisites, Mr. Banga will be provided with a cash allowance of $35,000 (less lawful deductions) for 2009, payable as soon as practicable after the date he commences employment. For 2010, he will be provided with a cash allowance of $35,000 (less lawful deductions) payable in a lump sum, in January 2010. The allowance is subject to review on an annual basis by the Compensation Committee, and may be modified or eliminated, based on competitive assessment.
The Company will offer certain relocation assistance to Mr. Banga in accordance with the Company's policies.
The foregoing descriptions of Mr. Banga's Agreement and the Offer Letter do not purport to be complete descriptions and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement and the Offer Letter, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination by Voluntary Resignation in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.4(c).

5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company, except that the Company's obligation to pay any incentive bonus that would otherwise be payable during the period of suspension shall be held in abeyance pending the conclusion of the Company's investigation. If the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated, the Company shall pay to the Executive any compensation withheld pursuant to this Paragraph 5.4, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Executive is acquitted or exonerated, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any. Such payments and benefits shall be paid and/or provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration and shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.

Acknowledgements; Confidential Information; Competitive Activities; Non Solicitation
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality.
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written
 
notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i) VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or VISA Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or
 
more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive terminates his employment pursuant to Paragraph 5.1.5(e) above, the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 6.3 shall be limited to the following entities: VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. and NYCE. Further, it shall not be deemed a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and
 
affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works").

On July 1, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Prepayment Agreement") with the plaintiffs to modify its payment obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Prepayment Agreement, the Company will make a prepayment of its remaining $400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of $335 million on September 30, 2009. The Prepayment Agreement is subject to court approval. The Prepayment Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
This Agreement to Prepay Future Payments at a Discount (the "Agreement") is dated as of July 1, 2009, by and between Co-Lead Counsel (as defined below), acting collectively as binding representative and agent of the Plaintiffs and MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"). Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Settlement Agreement (as defined below).
WHEREAS, Constantine Cannon LLP (formerly, Constantine & Partners) and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP (formerly, Hagens Berman), together serve as co-lead counsel ("Co-Lead Counsel") to the Plaintiffs in the In Re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation, No. 96-CV-5238 (JG/JO), a class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the "Court") against MasterCard; and
WHEREAS, the Plaintiffs and MasterCard filed with the Court an executed settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") on June 4, 2003, that the Court approved on December 19, 2003, and that became final on June 1, 2005, after the denial of or expiration of all time for appeals; and
WHEREAS, MasterCard is obligated under Section 3(a) of the Settlement Agreement to make four additional payments of $100 million each (the "Future Payments") into the Settlement Fund Account on or before the following dates: December 22, 2009, December 22, 2010, December 22, 2011, and December 22, 2012; and
WHEREAS, in connection with the Settlement Agreement, Co-Lead Counsel established the MasterCard Qualified Settlement Fund bearing Employer Identification Number 20-0065872 (the "MasterCard Qualified Settlement Fund"); and
WHEREAS, Section 3(b) of the Settlement Agreement provides that MasterCard may request that Plaintiffs work with MasterCard to establish a mutually agreeable discount rate to apply to any prepayment(s) in the event that MasterCard desires to make one or more payments on an accelerated basis; and
WHEREAS, MasterCard and Co-Lead Counsel now desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence their mutual agreement and specify the terms with respect to the prepayment by MasterCard of the Future Payments at a discount.
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1. . The parties hereby agree that MasterCard shall make a payment of $335,000,000 (the "Payment") on September 30, 2009 (the "Payment Date") into the existing MasterCard Qualified Settlement Fund account established pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which are incorporated herein. The Payment shall be in full satisfaction of all of MasterCard's remaining payment obligations to the Plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement upon Final Approval as defined in Section 4 below.
Payment
Section 2. . Except as provided in Section 4, upon making the Payment, MasterCard shall no longer be obligated to make the Future Payments.
Future Payments
Section 3. . Failure of MasterCard to make the Payment on the Payment Date, shall constitute an event of default hereunder and shall entitle the Plaintiffs to seek from the Court immediate recovery of the Payment and any and all additional relief they believe appropriate including immediately payable post-judgment interest.
Event of Default
Section 4. . Co-Lead Counsel agrees to seek approval of the Court and will use reasonable efforts to secure that approval as promptly as possible.

Exhibit 99.1
 
-
      Net income growth of 26.4%, excluding the special item from last year
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2009. The company reported net income of $349 million, or $2.67 per diluted share. Net income grew 26.4%, excluding the special item from last year. The company's total operating expenses, other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying GAAP reconciliations.
Purchase, NY, July 30, 2009
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2009 was $1.3 billion, a 2.7% increase versus the same period in 2008. On a constant currency basis (excluding the movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar), net revenue increased 7.0% compared to the same period in 2008. The higher net revenue in the second quarter this year was fueled by:
 
 
 
These contributing factors were partially offset by the impact of lower gross dollar volumes on second-quarter 2009 revenue.
MasterCard's gross dollar volume was down by 0.6% on a local currency basis, versus the second quarter of 2008, to $595 billion. Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was down by 0.7% on a local currency basis, versus the second quarter of 2008, to $450 billion. As of June 30, 2009, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 959 million MasterCard cards, an increase of 1.2% over the cards issued at June 30, 2008.
"We are very pleased with our second-quarter financial performance and are adapting well to the challenging economic environment," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "The thoughtful actions we've taken to realign our resources
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
and priorities to match customer and local market needs, as well as our sharp focus on expense management, have enabled us to deliver strong operating margin and net income improvements.
"At the same time, we continue to invest in the future so that we are solidly positioned once the economic tide begins to turn," said Selander. "We operate a global, flexible and resilient business that will continue to benefit from the ongoing shift toward electronic payments, which consumers, businesses and governments find more efficient, secure and easier to manage."
The special item for the second quarter of 2009 represented a $0.5 million litigation settlement charge. The special item for the second quarter of 2008 represented a $1.65 billion charge related to a litigation settlement.
Excluding special items, total operating expenses decreased 13.0%, to $722 million, during the second quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.2 percentage points to the rate of decline. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including special items, total operating expenses decreased 70.9%, to $723 million, primarily due to the litigation settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2008.
Operating margin was 43.6 % for the second quarter of 2009, up 10.2 percentage points over the year-ago period, excluding special items.
Total other expense was $21 million in the second quarter of 2009 versus total other income of $10 million in the second quarter of 2008. Interest expense versus the year-ago period increased $16 million, primarily due to the interest accretion associated with the litigation settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2008.
Excluding special items in both periods, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.0% in the second quarter of 2009, versus 35.3% in the comparable period in 2008. Including the special items, the effective tax rate was 35.0% for the second quarter of 2009, versus 39.0% in the comparable period in 2008. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charge for the litigation settlement recorded in the second quarter of 2008.

Year-to-Date 2009 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, MasterCard reported net income of $717 million excluding the special item and $716 million including the special item, or $5.47 per diluted share in both cases.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $2.4 billion, or essentially flat versus the same period in 2008. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 4.5%. Increased processed transactions of 6.9% and pricing changes of approximately 6 percentage points contributed to the revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These contributing factors were partially offset by the impact of lower gross dollar volumes on revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2009.
Total operating expenses decreased 12.0%, to $1.3 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2008, excluding special items for both periods. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.2 percentage points of this decrease. Including special items, operating expenses decreased 58.1%, to $1.3 billion.
Total other expense was $32 million for the six-month period versus total other income of $183 million for the same period in 2008, including special items. The decrease was primarily driven by gains from the sale of Redecard securities and the termination of a customer business agreement in 2008.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 34.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2009, versus a rate of 35.2% in the comparable period in 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an adjustment to deferred taxes reflected in the first quarter of 2009. Including the special items, the effective tax rate was 34.1% for the 2009 period, and 43.9% for the 2008 period. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the charge for the litigation settlement in 2008.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On July 29, 2009, MasterCard International Incorporated (the "Company"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Registrant"), adopted the MasterCard International Incorporated Executive Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan") and the MasterCard International Incorporated Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan"), each effective as of August 1, 2009. Individuals eligible to participate under both the Executive Severance Plan and the CIC Plan include, among others, named executive officers who do not otherwise have a written employment agreement.
Executive Severance Plan
Eligible Members.
The Executive Severance Plan provides for accrued payments and, in certain circumstances, severance payments (as described below) to be paid upon termination to members of the Company's Executive Committee who do not have a written employment agreement with the Company and who are designated in writing by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (each an "Eligible Member"). Eligible Members are not eligible to participate in, and receive any severance benefits under, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan").
.
Accrued Payments
In the event of an Eligible Member's death, his or her estate and/or beneficiaries are entitled to a lump sum payment within 30 days following the date of termination of: (1) base salary earned but not paid through the date of the Eligible Member's death; (2) payment for all accrued but unused vacation time; (3) the target annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which death occurs, and the prior year if not already paid; and (4) such additional benefits, if any, the executive may be entitled to under the Company's plans and programs on account of death.
Death.
In the event of an Eligible Member's termination of employment on account of disability, the Eligible Member will be entitled to receive the same payments as noted above in the event of his or her death, except that the Eligible Member's target annual incentive bonus will be pro-rated for the year of his or her termination.
Disability.
In the event an Eligible Member's employment ends upon mandatory retirement (i.e., the last day of the calendar year in which he or she attains the age of sixty-five), he or she will be entitled to receive the same payments as noted above in the event of his or her death, except that the Eligible Member's target annual incentive bonus will be pro-rated for the year in which his or her termination occurs, based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period (and taking into account the terms of the annual incentive plan, including but not limited to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to reduce the bonus amount).
Mandatory Retirement.
If the Company terminates the Eligible Member's employment for "Cause" (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan and described below under "Definitions") or the Eligible Member voluntarily resigns, he or she will be entitled to, within 30 days of the date of termination: (1) a payment with respect to base salary earned but not paid through the date of his termination, (2) payment for all accrued but unused vacation time and (3) additional benefits, if any, that the Eligible Member would be entitled to under the Company's plans and programs on account of termination for Cause or his or her voluntary resignation.
For Cause or Voluntary Resignation.
 
In the event of the Eligible Member's termination by the Company without Cause or by the Eligible Member with "Good Reason" (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan and described below under "Definitions"), he or she will be entitled to (in addition to any "Severance Payments" described below): (1) a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination of all base salary earned but not paid prior to the date of termination; (2) a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination equal to all accrued but unused vacation time; (3) a pro-rata portion of the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which his or her termination occurs and the prior year, if not already paid, based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period as determined by the Compensation Committee and payable in accordance with the regular bonus pay practices of the Company.
Without Cause or With Good Reason.
Severance Payments.
In addition to any payments described above, in the event of an Eligible Member's termination either by the Company without Cause or by the Eligible Member for Good Reason, and in each case unless otherwise disqualified as described below, an Eligible Member will be entitled to:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's obligation to make the severance payments described in bullets 1 through 4 above is conditioned upon the Eligible Member's execution of a separation agreement and release, within 60 days following the date of termination, of all claims to the Eligible Member's employment or the termination of such employment. Such an agreement would include non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for an 18-month period (or the length of the severance payments, if longer, as described above).
The Executive Severance Plan provides that Eligible Members are only entitled to receive severance payments in the events described above, and would not be entitled to receive such severance payments in the event of termination of employment with the Company due to (1) death, (2) disability, (3) voluntary resignation for any reason other than for Good Reason, (4) termination for Cause or (5) mandatory retirement, or in the event that the Eligible Member fails to give notice of termination for Good Reason within 60 days of the events constituting Good Reason.
 
.
Modification or Termination
The Executive Severance Plan may be amended, modified or terminated by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Registrant (the "Compensation Committee") at any time at the Company's sole discretion.
CIC Plan
Eligible Employees.
The CIC Plan provides change in control severance payments and benefits to all employees of the Company who: (1) do not have an employment agreement with the Company and (2) have been selected in writing prior to a "Change-in-Control" (as defined in the MasterCard Incorporated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the "2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan"), and described below) by the Company's Chief Executive Officer or by the Compensation Committee, in their respective sole and absolute discretion, as being eligible to participate. Any such selection by the Chief Executive Officer must be made at least 6 months preceding a Change-in-Control.
CIC Payments.
In the event that, within 6 months preceding or 2 years following a Change-in-Control, an Eligible Employee either: (1) is terminated by the Company or the Company's successor without "Cause" (as defined in the CIC Plan and described below) or (2) terminates his or her employment with the Company or the Company's successor for "Good Reason" (as defined in the CIC Plan and described below), and in each case unless otherwise ineligible as described below, an Eligible Employee will be entitled to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's obligation to make the Change-in-Control payments described above in bullets 4 through 7 is conditioned upon the Eligible Employee's execution of a separation agreement and release, within 60 days following the date of termination, of all claims to the Eligible Member's employment or the termination of such employment, which would include a 2-year non-competition restriction and a 2-year non-solicitation restriction.
The CIC Plan provides that Eligible Employees are only entitled to receive Change-in-Control payments in the events described above, and would not be entitled to receive such payments in the event of termination of employment with the Company or the Company's successor due to: (1) death, (2) disability, (3) voluntary resignation for any reason other than for Good Reason, (4) termination for Cause at any time preceding or following a Change-in-Control or (5) mandatory retirement, or in the event that the Eligible Employee fails to give notice of termination for Good Reason within 60 days of the events constituting Good Reason. The CIC Plan expressly provides that a Change-in-Control alone, without a related termination of employment, will in no event give rise to any Change-in-Control payments or benefits under the CIC Plan.
Modification or Termination.
The CIC Plan may be amended, modified or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any time at the Company's sole discretion, except that for a two-year period following a Change of Control, no amendment, modification or termination of the CIC Plan may be effected which may have a detrimental effect on the rights or benefits payable to an Eligible Employee without his or her written consent.
Certain Definitions in Executive Severance Plan or CIC Plan
Each of the Executive Severance Plan and the CIC Plan defines "Cause" to generally mean: (a) the willful failure by the Eligible Member or Eligible Employee, as applicable, to perform his or her duties or responsibilities (other than due to disability); (b) engaging in serious misconduct that is injurious to the Company including, but not limited to, damage to its reputation or standing in its industry; (c) having been convicted of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony or a crime that constitutes a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (d) the material breach of any written covenant or agreement with the Company not to disclose any information pertaining to the Company; or (e) the breach of the Company's code of conduct, the supplemental code of conduct or any material provision of specified Company policies.
"Change-in-Control" for purposes of the CIC Plan has the meaning as set forth in the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Accordingly, it generally means the occurrence of any of the following events (other than by means of a public offering of the Registrant's equity securities):
(a) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of more than 30 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding equity securities of the Registrant (the "Outstanding Registrant Voting Securities"), subject to certain exceptions; or
(b) A change in the composition of the board of directors of the Registrant that causes less than a majority of the directors of the Registrant then in office to be members of the board, subject to certain exceptions; or
(c) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Registrant or the purchase of assets or
 
stock of another entity (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless immediately following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Registrant Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination will beneficially own more than 50 percent of the then outstanding voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the entity resulting from such Business Combination in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Registrant Voting Securities, (ii) no person will beneficially own more than a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such entity except to the extent that such ownership of the Registrant existed prior to the Business Combination, and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the entity resulting from such Business Combination will have been members of the incumbent board of the Registrant at the time of the initial agreement, or action of the board of the Registrant, providing for such Business Combination; or
(d) Approval by the stockholders of the Registrant of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Registrant.
"Good Reason" for the purpose of each of the Executive Severance Plan and the CIC Plan generally means: (a) the assignment to a position for which the plan participant is not qualified or a materially lesser position than the position held by the plan participant; (b) a material reduction in the plan participant's annual base salary other than a 10 percent or less reduction, in the aggregate, over the term of employment; or (c) the relocation of the plan participant's principal place of employment by more than 50 miles.
Section 409A and ERISA
Each of the Executive Severance Plan and CIC Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore each contains provisions that could, among other things, affect the amounts and timing of payments described above. Additionally, each of the Executive Severance Plan and CIC Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
The foregoing description of the Executive Severance Plan and the CIC Plan does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Executive Severance Plan and the CIC Plan, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

If the Eligible Member is entitled to receive severance payments and/or benefits as provided under the "Qualification" section, and has not been rendered ineligible for receipt of such severance payments and/or benefits due to a disqualifying event (as described above), the Eligible Member shall be entitled to the following payments (the "Severance Payments"):
1. Severance Pay
The Eligible Member shall be entitled to receive (i) Base Salary continuation for an eighteen (18) month period following the Eligible Member's Date of Termination (the "Severance Pay Period"), and (ii) payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan), of an amount equal to 1.5 times the annual incentive bonus paid to such Eligible Member for the year prior to the year in which the Eligible Member's Date of Termination occurs (the "Bonus Payment") payable ratably over the Severance Pay Period in accordance with the annual incentive bonus pay practices of the Company; (such Base Salary continuation and Bonus Payment being collectively referred to herein as "Severance Pay")
2. Medical Benefits Continuation
The Eligible Member shall be entitled to payment by the Company on the Eligible Member's behalf, for the monthly cost of the premiums for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), for a period equivalent to the eighteen (18) month COBRA period (twenty-nine (29) month period, if the Eligible Member is disabled under the Social Security Act within the first sixty (60) days of the continuation period) or the Severance Pay Period, whichever is shorter (the "Medical Benefits"), provided, however, such coverage shall not be provided if during such period the Eligible Member is or becomes ineligible under the provisions of COBRA for continuing coverage; and provided, further, that if the Eligible Member is eligible for Retiree Health Coverage under the MasterCard Retiree Health Plan, the Company shall pay the full cost of such Retiree Health or COBRA coverage, as applicable, during the Severance Pay Period and thereafter, retiree contribution levels provided under the provisions of the Retiree Health Plan shall apply.
3. Outplacement Services
The Eligible Member shall be entitled to reasonable outplacement services, to be provided by a firm selected by the Company, at a level generally made available to executives of the Company for the shorter of the Severance Pay Period or the period he or she remains unemployed.
4. Additional Payments
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to increase severance payments for up to an additional six months for Eligible Members. Additional payments may be conditioned upon any additional criteria as the Company may determine in its sole discretion.
The Eligible Member shall be entitled to such other benefits, if any, to which such Eligible Member is expressly eligible following the termination of the Eligible Member's employment by the Company without Cause, by the Eligible Member with Good Reason, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company (other than any severance payments payable under the terms of any benefit plan, including, but not limited to, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan).
5. Separation Agreement and Release
The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under this "Severance Payments" section, paragraphs (1)-(3), are conditioned upon the Eligible Member's execution (without revocation) of the Company's separation agreement and release of all claims related to the Eligible Member's employment or the termination thereof in a form satisfactory to MasterCard (the "Separation Agreement
 
and Release"), which Separation Agreement and Release shall include a non-competition restriction and a non-solicitation restriction for a period no less than the Severance Pay Period (taking into account any additional payment periods pursuant to Section 4 above), as more fully described in such Separation Agreement and Release, provided that if the Eligible Member should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under this "Severance Payments" section, paragraphs (1)-(3).
Income Taxes
Accrued payments and Severance Payments are subject to all applicable federal, state, and local tax withholding and generally are taxable income to the Eligible Member.
Section 409A of the Code
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Eligible Member in connection with his or her employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Eligible Member is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Eligible Member during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Eligible Member in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. If the Eligible Member dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Eligible Member's beneficiary within thirty (30) days of the Eligible Member's death.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, up to two (2) times the lesser of: (i) the Eligible Employee's Base Salary for the year preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in the "Severance Payments" section, paragraph (1), without regard to such six (6) month delay.
The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, specifically, with the separation pay exemption and short term deferral exemption of Section 409A of the Code, and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under the Plan may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under the Plan shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event may the Eligible Member, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Plan shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Eligible Member's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in the Plan), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense
 
will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
Administration of Plan
The "Plan Administrator" (as such term is defined in the "Definitions" section) shall have the exclusive right, power, and authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to administer, apply, and interpret the Plan and to decide all matters arising in connection with the operation or administration of the Plan to the extent not retained by MasterCard as set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall have the sole and absolute discretionary authority to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
All determinations made by the Plan Administrator as to any question involving their respective responsibilities, powers and duties under the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties, to the maximum extent permitted by law. All determinations by MasterCard referred to in the Plan shall be made by MasterCard in its capacity as an employer and settlor of the Plan.
Modification or Termination of Plan
MasterCard reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, including any or all of the provisions of the Plan, for any reason, at any time, by action of the Plan Administrator. Any amendments to the Plan must be approved in writing by the Human Resource Compensation Committee of MasterCard.
Claims and Appeal Procedures
The Plan Administrator shall make a determination in connection with the termination of employment of any Eligible Member as to whether a benefit under the Plan is payable to such Eligible Member, taking into consideration any determination made by the Company as to the circumstances regarding the termination, the Company's decision as to whether or not to pay a benefit under the "Qualification" section, the "Disqualifying Events" section, or the potential applicability of a disqualifying event, and as to the amount of payment. The Plan Administrator shall advise any Eligible Member it determines is entitled to severance and benefits under the Plan and the amount of such severance and benefits. The Plan Administrator may delegate any or all of its responsibilities under this section.
 
Claim Procedures
Each Eligible Member or his or her authorized representative (each, the "Claimant") claiming severance and benefits under the Plan who has not been advised of such severance and benefits by the Plan Administrator or who is not satisfied with the amount of any severance and benefits awarded under the Plan is eligible to file a written claim with the Plan Administrator.
Within ninety (90) days after receiving the claim, the Plan Administrator will decide whether or not to approve the claim. The ninety (90)-day period may be extended by the Plan Administrator for an additional ninety (90)-day period if special circumstances require an extension of time to consider the claim. If the Plan Administrator extends the ninety (90)-day period, the Claimant will be notified in writing before the expiration of the initial 90-day period as to the length of the extension and the special circumstances that necessitate the extension.
If the claim is denied, the Plan Administrator shall set forth in writing or electronically the reasons for the denial; the relevant provisions of the Plan on which the decision is made; a description of the Plan's claim appeal procedures; and if additional material or information is necessary to perfect the claim, an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. The notice will also include a statement regarding the procedures for the Claimant to file a request for review of the claim denial as set forth in the "Appeal Procedures" section and the Claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") following a claim denial on appeal.
Appeal Procedures
If a claim has been denied by the Plan Administrator and the Claimant wishes further consideration and review of his or her claim, he or she must file an appeal of the denial of the claim to the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after the receipt of the written notification of the Plan Administrator's denial. In correlation with his or her appeal, the Claimant may request the opportunity to review relevant documents prior to submission of a written statement, submit documents, records and comments in writing, and receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant's claim for severance and benefits under the Plan. The review of the appeal by the Plan Administrator will take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial review of the claim.
The Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant in writing or electronically of its decision with respect to its review of the appeal within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the request for a review of the claim. Due to special circumstances, the Plan Administrator may extend the time to reach a decision with respect to the appeal of the claim denial, in which case the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant in writing before the expiration of the initial 60-day period as to the length of the extension and the special circumstances that necessitate such extension and render a decision as soon as possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the receipt of the Claimant's request for appeal.
If the appeal is denied, the Plan Administrator will set forth in writing or electronically the specific reasons for the denial and references to the relevant Plan provisions on which the determination of the denial is based. The notice will also include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim, and a statement of the Claimant's right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
 
Exhaustion of Remedies under the Plan
A Claimant wishing to seek judicial review of an adverse benefit determination under the Plan, whether in whole or in part, must file any suit or legal action, including, without limitation, a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA, within one (1) year of the date the final decision on the adverse benefit determination on review is issued or should have been issued or lose any rights to bring such an action. If any such judicial proceeding is undertaken, the evidence presented shall be strictly limited to the evidence timely presented to the Plan Administrator.

Your Rights Under ERISA
The Department of Labor has issued regulations that require the Company to provide you with a statement of your rights under ERISA with respect to this Plan. The following statement was designated by the Department of Labor to satisfy this requirement and is presented accordingly.
 
As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that all Plan participants are entitled to:
Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits
 
 
 
Prudent Action by Fiduciaries
In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants.
No one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a pension or welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
Enforcing Your Rights
If your claim for severance and benefits is denied or ignored in whole or in part, you have a right to receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial, to obtain copies of documents related to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. You have the right to have your claim reviewed and reconsidered. You also have the right to request a review of the denial of your claim as explained in the "Appeal Procedures" section. No one, including your employer or any other person, may discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining severance and benefits under the Plan or exercising your rights under ERISA.
Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials from the Plan and do not receive them within thirty (30) days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for severance and benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court after you have exhausted the Plan's claims and appeal procedures as described in the section "Claims and Appeal Procedures" hereof. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.
The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
 
Assistance with Your Questions
If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator through your Human Resources Department. They will be glad to help you. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest Area Office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory, or you may contact:

At all times, payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of the Company.
Effective Date
The Plan is effective as of August 1, 2009.

Affiliates and subsidiaries of MasterCard may adopt this Plan upon approval by the Severance Plan Committee. The list of the Participating Employers as of the Effective Date is attached to this Plan as .
Exhibit A
Eligibility
The following employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Plan ("Eligible Employees"):
 
Qualification
 
 
 
 
Circumstances of Ineligibility
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to receive a Change-in-Control Pay (as defined below) if any of the following Circumstances of Ineligibility apply to such Eligible Employee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amount and Duration of Change in Control Severance Payments
If the Eligible Employee is entitled to receive a Change-in-Control Pay, and has not been rendered ineligible for receipt of such Change-in-Control Pay due to a Circumstance of Ineligibility, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to the following payments:
 
The Eligible Employee shall be entitled to the following payments following the Date of Termination (as such term is defined in the "Definitions" section):
 
 
 
 
 
The Eligible Employee shall be entitled to receive (i) Base Salary continuation, and (ii) payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan), of an amount equivalent to the average annual incentive bonus received by such Eligible Employee with respect to the prior two (2) years of the Eligible Employee's employment by the Company (the "Average Bonus Payment"), payable on a schedule in accordance with the regular payroll practices (but in no event less frequently than monthly) and annual incentive bonus pay practices of the Company (such Base Salary continuation and Average Bonus Payment being collectively referred to herein as "Change-in-Control Pay") for, and with respect to a twenty-four (24) month period following the Eligible Employee's Date of Termination ( the "Change-in-Control Pay Period").
 
The Eligible Employee shall be entitled to payment by the Company on the Eligible Employee's behalf, for the monthly cost of the premiums for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), for a period equivalent to the eighteen (18) month COBRA period (twenty-nine (29) month period, if the Eligible Employee is disabled under the Social Security Act within the first sixty (60) days of the continuation period) or the Change-in-Control Pay Period, whichever is shorter (the "Medical Benefits"), provided, however, such coverage shall not be provided if during such period the Eligible Employee is or becomes ineligible under the provisions of COBRA for continuing coverage; and provided, further, that if the Eligible Employee is eligible for Retiree Health Coverage under the MasterCard Retiree Health Plan, the Company shall pay the full cost of such Retiree Health or COBRA coverage, as applicable, during the Change-in-Control Pay Period and thereafter, retiree contribution levels provided under the provisions of the Retiree Health Plan shall apply.
 
The Eligible Employee shall be entitled to reasonable outplacement services, to be provided by a firm selected by the Company, at a level generally made available to executives of the Company for the shorter of the Change-in-Control Pay Period or the period he or she remains unemployed.
 
The Eligible Employee shall be entitled to such other benefits, if any, to which such Eligible Employee is expressly eligible following the termination of the Eligible Employee's employment by the Company without Cause, by the Eligible Employee with Good Reason, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company (other than any severance payments payable under the terms of any benefit plan, including, but not limited to, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan).
 
The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under this "Amount and Duration of Change in Control Severance Payments" section, paragraphs (b)-(d), are conditioned upon the Eligible Employee's execution (without revocation) of the Company's separation agreement and release of all claims related to the Eligible Employee's employment or the termination thereof in a form satisfactory to MasterCard (the "Separation Agreement and Release"), which Separation Agreement and Release shall include a 2-year non-competition restriction and a 2-year non-solicitation restriction, as more fully described in such Separation Agreement and Release, provided that if the Eligible Employee should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under this "Amount and Duration of Change in Control Severance Payments" section, paragraphs (b)-(d).
Income Taxes
The change in control severance payments and benefits provided hereunder are subject to all applicable foreign, federal, state, and local tax withholding and generally are taxable income to the Eligible Employee.
Section 409A of the Code
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Eligible Employee in connection with his or her employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Eligible Employee is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Eligible Employee during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Eligible Employee in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. If the Eligible Employee dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Eligible Employee's beneficiary within thirty (30) days of the Eligible Employee's death.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, Change-in-Control Pay in an amount up to two (2) times the lesser of: (i) the Eligible Employee's Base Salary for the year preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in the "Amount and Duration of Change in Control Severance Payments" section, paragraph (b), without regard to such six (6) month delay.
 
The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, specifically, with the separation pay exemption and short term deferral exemption of Section 409A of the Code, and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under the Plan may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under the Plan shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event may the Eligible Employee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Plan and the Separation Agreement and Release shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Eligible Employee's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in the Plan or the Separation Agreement and Release, as applicable), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
Administration of Plan
The "Plan Administrator" (as such term is defined in the "Definitions" section) shall have the exclusive right, power, and authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to administer, apply, and interpret the Plan and to decide all matters arising in connection with the operation or administration of the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall have the sole and absolute discretionary authority to:
 
 
 
 
 
All determinations made by the Plan Administrator as to any question involving their respective responsibilities, powers and duties under the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties, to the maximum extent permitted by law. All determinations by MasterCard referred to in the Plan shall be made by MasterCard in its capacity as an employer and settlor of the Plan.
 
Modification or Termination of Plan
MasterCard reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, including any or all of the provisions of the Plan, for any reason, at any time, by action of the Human Resource Compensation Committee of MasterCard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a two year period following a Change in Control, no amendment, modification or termination of the Plan which may have a detrimental effect on the rights or benefits payable to any Eligible Employee without such Eligible Employee's written consent.

The Plan Administrator shall make a determination in connection with the termination of employment of any Eligible Employee as to whether a benefit under the Plan is payable to such Eligible Employee, taking into consideration any determination made by the Company as to the circumstances regarding the termination, the Company's decision as to whether or not to pay a benefit under the "Qualification" section, paragraph (c), or the potential applicability of any Circumstances of Ineligibility, and as to the amount of payment.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2009. The company reported net income of $456 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, excluding special items, and net income of $452 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, including special items. The company's total operating expenses, other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying GAAP reconciliations.
Purchase, NY, November 3, 2009
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $1.4 billion, a 2.0% increase versus the same period in 2008. On a constant currency basis (excluding the movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar), net revenue increased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2008. The higher net revenue in the third quarter this year benefited from:
 
 
These factors were partially offset by the impact of slightly lower cross border volumes on third-quarter 2009 revenue, compared to the same period in 2008.
MasterCard's gross dollar volume was relatively flat, up 0.3% on a local currency basis, versus the third quarter of 2008, to $633 billion. Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was also relatively flat, up 0.4% on a local currency basis, versus the third quarter of 2008, to $480 billion. As of September 30, 2009, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 964 million MasterCard cards, comparable to the number of cards issued at September 30, 2008.
"We are very pleased with our third-quarter financial results, specifically since we began to see signs of stabilization in parts of our business," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard chief executive officer. "Total processed transactions continued to grow at a high single-digit rate, with double-digit growth coming from our Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa and Latin America regions. At the same time, our overall cross-border volumes are steadying with our Asia Pacific region demonstrating significant growth in the quarter, and the U.S.

showing a lower rate of decline. We continued to aggressively manage costs and improve margins, while still investing in key growth areas across our business.
"Overall, our results once again underscore the global trend toward electronic payments, and the strength of our business model," Selander added. "We continue to make life easier for consumers, businesses and governments, all of whom seek safer, more controllable and more efficient payment alternatives for everyday commerce."
Special items for the third quarter of 2009 represented $6.2 million pre-tax litigation settlement charges. The special item for the third quarter of 2008 represented an $827.5 million net pre-tax charge related to an antitrust litigation settlement.
Excluding special items, total operating expenses decreased 13.3%, to $685 million, during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Currency fluctuations contributed 1.3 percentage points to the rate of decline. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including special items, total operating expenses decreased 57.3%, to $691 million, primarily due to the net litigation settlement that occurred in the third quarter of 2008.
Excluding special items, the operating margin was 49.8% for the third quarter of 2009, up 8.8 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including special items, the operating margin was 49.4% for the third quarter of 2009.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.9% in the third quarter of 2009. For the third quarter of 2008, the effective tax rate was 39.7%, excluding special items, and 34.1% including the special items. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charge for the net litigation settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2008.

Year-to-Date 2009 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, MasterCard reported net income of $1.2 billion, or $8.95 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items, and net income of $1.2 billion, or $8.92 per diluted share, including special items.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, was $3.8 billion, a 0.9% increase versus the same period in 2008. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 4.4%. Increased processed transactions of 7.0% and pricing changes of approximately 6 percentage points contributed to the revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by the impact of slightly lower cross border volumes on revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, relative to the comparable period last year.
Total operating expenses decreased 12.5%, to $2.0 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2008, excluding special items for both periods. Currency fluctuations contributed 2.5 percentage points of this decrease. Including special items, operating expenses decreased 57.8%.
Total net other expense was $32 million for the nine-month period versus total net other income of $169 million for the same period in 2008, including special items. The decrease in other income was primarily driven by gains from the sale of Redecard securities and the termination of a customer business agreement in 2008.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 33.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2009, versus a rate of 36.7% in the comparable period in 2008. Including the special items, the effective tax rate was 33.6% for the 2009 period, and 40.4% for the 2008 period. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the charge for litigation settlements in 2008.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

On February 4, 2010, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its fourth quarter and full-year 2009.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
In the attached press release, MasterCard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
MasterCard's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the attached press release includes reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
On February 4, 2010, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2009 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.
 
On February 2, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors determined that its annual meeting of stockholders will take place at its corporate headquarters on September 21, 2010.
Also on February 2, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors authorized programs to facilitate conversions of shares of Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock for subsequent sale or transfer to public investors, beginning after May 31, 2010. The conversion programs follow the expiration on May 31, 2010 of a 4-year restriction period with respect to the conversion of shares of Class B common stock.
The Company currently expects that the first 2010 conversion program will consist of four one-week periods in June 2010. Holders of shares of Class B common stock will be able to make conversion elections in a program to be modeled on the Company's 2008 and 2009 programs, except that there will not be a limit on the number of shares of Class B common stock that are eligible for conversion by any one holder. Starting in early July 2010, the Company expects to run a subsequent, continuous conversion program for remaining shares of Class B common stock, featuring an "open window" for elections of any size.
Participation in each of the conversion programs is optional for holders of Class B common stock. Details of both the first conversion program and the subsequent open conversion program are expected to be communicated to Class B shareholders in late March 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $294 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, including an after-tax severance charge of $0.19 per diluted share. The company's total operating expenses, other income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding special items, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying GAAP reconciliations.
Purchase, NY, February 4, 2010
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.3 billion, a 6.0% increase versus the same period in 2008. Currency fluctuations (driven by the movement of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar) contributed 3.8 percentage points of the increase in net revenue for the quarter. The higher net revenue in the fourth quarter this year benefited from:
 
 
 
 
The net revenue growth was somewhat tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter rose 5.7% on a local currency basis, versus the fourth quarter of 2008, to $510 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the company's customers had issued 966 million MasterCard cards, a decline of 1.3% over the cards issued at December 31, 2008.
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
"In 2009 we took important steps to maintain MasterCard's bottom-line growth, and as a result delivered another quarter and year of solid financial results," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard chief executive officer. "We remained focused on the needs of our customers, and continued to add value amid a challenging economic environment. For example, we recently announced a significant debit win in the U.S. with SunTrust and the first consumer inControl implementation with Barclaycard in the UK."
Selander commented, "Throughout the year, we greatly improved our expense management and realigned our organization to capitalize on the most promising growth opportunities, from both a geographic and product development standpoint.
"In the fourth quarter, we saw encouraging signs with regard to key aspects of our business as cross-border volumes increased and processed transactions continued to grow. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance, and we look forward to building on that momentum as the global economic climate continues to improve," concluded Selander.
There were no special items for the fourth quarter of 2009. The special item for the fourth quarter of 2008 represented a $6 million charge related to a litigation settlement.
Total operating expenses increased 9.8%, to $830 million, during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, excluding special items. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.2 percentage points of the increase in expenses. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
The operating margin was 36.1% for the fourth quarter of 2009.
Total other expense was $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus total other expense of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense of $13 million related to litigation settlements versus the comparable period in 2008.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 46.1% in the comparable period in 2008, excluding special items. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
Full-Year 2009 Results
For the year-ended December 31, 2009, MasterCard reported net income of $1.5 billion, or $11.19 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items, and net income of $1.5 billion, or $11.16 per diluted share, including special items. The 2009 earnings per share figure includes an after-tax severance charge of $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $0.16 in 2008. The 2008 earnings per share figure includes after-tax gains from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Redecard S.A. of $0.43 per diluted share.
Special items for the full-year 2009 included charges of $7 million related to litigation settlements.
Special items for the full-year 2008 included:
 
 
Net revenue for the full-year 2009 was $5.1 billion, a 2.1% increase versus 2008. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 3.9%. Increased processed transactions of 6.9% and pricing changes of approximately 6 percentage points contributed to the revenue growth in the full-year period. These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower cross-border volume growth on a U.S. dollar basis and higher rebates and incentives for 2009 compared to 2008.
Excluding special items for both periods, total operating expenses decreased 6.9%, to $2.8 billion, for full-year 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced advertising and marketing expenses versus the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of severance costs in both periods, total operating expenses decreased 10.5%. Currency fluctuations of 1.4 percentage points also contributed to the decline. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including special items, total operating expenses in 2009 decreased 48.6%, to $2.8 billion, versus 2008.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 4
 
Excluding special items, the operating margin was 44.5% for full-year 2009, up 5.5 percentage points over the year-ago period. Including special items, the operating margin was 44.3% for the full-year 2009.
Total other expense was $42 million for full-year 2009 versus total other income of $76 million for the same period in 2008, excluding special items. Investment income decreased due to gains recorded in 2008 from the sale of the remaining Redecard securities. Interest expense increased $12 million versus the year-ago period, primarily due to interest accretion associated with a 2008 litigation settlement. Including special items, total other income was $151 million for full-year 2008.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 34.1% for the full-year 2009, versus a rate of 38.8% for the full-year 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a lower deferred tax remeasurement and a decrease in tax reserves in 2009. Including special items, the effective tax rate was 34.1% for 2009 and 33.7% for 2008.

The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

On February 1, 2010, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2010 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on April 23, 2009) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2010 under the SEAICP are based upon the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and operating margin improvement targets. Actual bonus award amounts will be based upon a weighting of two-thirds for actual performance achieved against the net income target and one-third for actual performance achieved against the operating margin improvement target. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2010 annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Offer Letter references the developments described above and sets forth a summary of modifications to both Mr. Banga's existing employment agreement with MasterCard International, dated June 16, 2009 (the "Existing Agreement"), and his initial offer letter from MasterCard International, dated June 15, 2009.

Compensation

The Offer Letter provides that Mr. Banga's base salary will be increased from $800,000 to $900,000.

The change effected by the adoption of the Amended and Restated Bylaws was to technically conform to changes previously made to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on June 10, 2009, following a stockholder vote at its 2009 annual meeting of stockholders, to reflect an increase to the potential maximum size of the Board of Directors of the Company to fifteen directors.

A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
(d) 
Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Corporation") for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, if any, within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board").
Section 2. Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, notice of the time, place (if any) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be given not more than sixty, nor less than ten, days previous thereto, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting at such address as appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation; but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders present may, to the extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
Section 5. The Chairman of the Board, or in the Chairman's absence or at the Chairman's direction, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer's absence or
 
Effective as of April 12, 2010
at the Chief Executive Officer's direction, any officer of the Corporation shall call all meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of any such meetings. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in such officer's absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, convening the meeting and adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of record of the Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting, whether any stockholder or stockholder's proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the chairman of the meeting, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate.
Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 8. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders (a) entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or (b) entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date (i) in the case of clause (a) above, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting and (ii) in the case of clause (b) above, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such action. If for any reason the Board shall not have fixed a record date for any such purpose, the record date for such purpose shall be determined as provided by law. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed or determined shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date so fixed or determined.
Section 9. At any time when the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation permits action by one or more classes of stockholders of the Corporation to be taken by written consent, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents properly delivered in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, this section and the DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date of the meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
 
stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Section 10. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
Section 11. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the Corporation or candidates for office. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Inspectors of stockholder votes shall, subject to the power of the chairman of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.

Furthermore, in accordance with Section 9.1 of your Employment Agreement, as Ajay has been appointed to succeed you as CEO prior to December 31, 2010, you will be assisting him in his transition through and including December 31, 2010.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I wish to express our sincere gratitude for your visionary leadership and exemplary service to the Company during your 13-year tenure as CEO.

Selander, MasterCard chief executive officer. "We also made a number of announcements that position MasterCard well for continued success, including signing a long-term agreement for HSBC's global mass affluent Premier credit business, and the ongoing adoption of MasterCard inControl with Fifth Third, J.P. Morgan and First National Bank of Omaha."
MasterCard president and chief operating officer, Ajay Banga, further remarked, "We're making important investments in innovation, like MasterCard Marketplace, our eCommerce shopping portal, and the launch of MasterCard Labs, a critical component of our global research and development efforts." Banga stated, "We are committed to play a significant role in the evolution of payments to better meet the needs of consumers, merchants, businesses and governments around the world, and look forward to bringing even more developments to the market."

Total operating expenses increased 2.2%, to $608 million, during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 0.5%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a 0.7% decrease in advertising and marketing expenses versus the year-ago period. Excluding currency fluctuations, advertising and marketing expenses declined 3.8%.
The operating margin was 53.5% for the first quarter of 2010, up 4.9 percentage points over the year-ago period.
Total other expense was $5 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $11 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by lower interest expense primarily due to a reduction in interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 34.6% in the first quarter of 2010, versus 33.2% in the comparable period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to an adjustment to the balance of deferred taxes in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by lower state tax rates and more favorable geographic distribution of earnings in the first quarter of 2010.
There were no special items for the first quarter of 2009 or 2010.

Note that columns in the tables above may not add due to rounding; growth represents change from the comparable year-ago period.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Noah J. Hanft, General Counsel, Chief Payment System Integrity and Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares for personal financial management purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of approximately 10,813 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), underlying stock option awards. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to specified limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as July 24, 2010 and will end no later than April 22, 2011. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Mr. Hanft will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby he is encouraged to hold at least four times his base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A common stock held directly or indirectly by Mr. Hanft are included; however, restricted stock units, performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that approximately 7.5 million shares of the Company's Class B common stock were elected for participation in the first week of the Company's previously announced four-week program to facilitate conversions of shares of the Company's Class B common stock. Effective June 1, 2010, all of such shares of Class B common stock were converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock for subsequent sale or transfer to public investors in accordance with the terms of both the program and the Company's certificate of incorporation. Following such conversion, shares of the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock represented approximately 90.4% and 9.6%, respectively, of the aggregate outstanding shares of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
This level of Class B ownership represents the first time the outstanding shares of the Class B common stock have represented less than 15% of the aggregate outstanding shares of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Accordingly, pursuant to Article IV, Section 4.3(G) of the Company's certificate of incorporation, all outstanding shares of the Company's Class M common stock have been automatically transferred to the Company and retired, and are no longer available for issue or reissue. Additionally, the Company no longer has authority to issue additional shares of Class M common stock. Although the Class M common stock was generally non-voting, the holders of Class M common stock had (prior to the retirement of such class) the right to elect up to three of the Company's directors (but not more than one-quarter of all directors) and approve specified significant corporate actions under our certificate of incorporation. In light of the retirement of the Class M common stock, the Company's board of directors intends to propose changes to the Company's governance arrangements, the details of which will be described in the Company's proxy statement for its September 2010 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination for Good Reason in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e).

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination by Voluntary Resignation in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.4(c).
5.1.7 if within sixty (60) days subsequent to the termination of the Executive's employment for death, Disability, Good Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that the Executive could have been terminated for Cause
 
hereunder, such termination shall be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to the Company. Thereafter, the Company may take appropriate legal action to seek recompense for any payments or benefits improperly paid to the Executive, his estate or beneficiaries hereunder, as the case may be. Following a judicial determination, the prevailing party in any action under this Paragraph 5.1.7, shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1.7.

(other than any severance payments payable under the terms of any benefit plan, including, but not limited to, the MasterCard International Incorporated Severance Plan).
 
(f) The Company's obligations to make payments and provide benefits under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e) are conditioned on the Executive or his legal representative's execution (without revocation) of a separation agreement and general release of claims ("Separation Agreement and Release") in substantially the form annexed hereto, provided that if the Executive should fail to execute such Separation Agreement and Release within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall not have any obligation to make the payments and provide the benefits contemplated under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e). Benefits under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e) that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be accumulated and paid on the first scheduled payment date following expiration of the revocation period for the Separation Agreement and Release, and any subsequent payments shall continue, and any payments subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made, on the payment dates set forth in Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e).
(g) If the Term of Employment ends on a date after December 31, 2014, because: (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company (other than for Cause or Disability) in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.4 above; (ii) the Executive terminates his employment with Good Reason in accordance with the terms set forth in Paragraph 5.1.5 above; or (iii) the Company elects to not further extend the Term of Employment in accordance with Paragraph 1.1 (whether before or after a Change in Control), the Term of Employment shall end as of the Date of Termination and the Executive shall be entitled to only those payments and benefits provided in Paragraphs 5.2.5(a) and (e) of this Agreement.
5.2.6 . In the event the Executive's employment with the Company ends upon Mandatory Retirement, the Executive shall be eligible for the following lump sum payment (subject to any previously elected deferrals under the MasterCard Incorporated Deferral Plan) as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination:
Termination Upon Mandatory Retirement

(b) payment for all accrued but unused vacation time up to the Date of Termination;
(c) the annual incentive bonus payable for the year in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs and the prior year, if not already paid, based upon the actual performance of the Company for the applicable performance period (and taking into account the terms of the Plan including but not limited to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to reduce such bonus amount) as contemplated in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, with such amount payable when the incentive bonus is regularly paid to similarly situated employees for such year; and
 
(d) such additional vested benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company, provided, however, in no event shall the Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.5(b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company, except that the Company's obligation to pay any incentive bonus that would otherwise be payable during the period of suspension shall be held in abeyance pending the conclusion of the Company's investigation. If the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated, the Company shall pay to the Executive any compensation withheld pursuant to this Paragraph 5.4, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Executive is acquitted or exonerated, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive
 
during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any. Such payments and benefits shall be paid and/or provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration and shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.

Acknowledgements; Confidential Information; Competitive Activities; Non Solicitation
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality.
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless
 
otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i)
 
VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or VISA Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Further, it shall not be deemed a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the
 
products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)(d) above, during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for the Severance Pay previously received from the Company with respect to any period of time during the Severance Pay Period in which the Executive has been found by the court to have been in breach. In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. He
 
further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
7. .
Reimbursement of Business Expense
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
8. .

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
9.10 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Executive in connection with his employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Executive during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Executive dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiaries, as the case may be, within thirty (30) days of the Executive's death.

In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and Release shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement and General Release, as applicable), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter 2010. The company reported net income of $458 million, or $3.49 per diluted share.
Purchase, NY, August 3, 2010
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was $1.4 billion, a 6.7% increase versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 7.9% compared to the same period in 2009. The higher net revenue this quarter was driven by:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by additional rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 7.9% on a local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2009, to $493 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 0.1% compared to the same period in 2009, to 5.6 billion. As of June 30, 2010, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Solid GDV growth, particularly in markets outside the U.S., continued momentum in worldwide cross-border volumes, and thoughtful expense management all contributed to good financial results this quarter."
Banga commented, "No matter where you are in the world, people seek fast, secure, and efficient payment experiences, and MasterCard is delivering payment innovations that will make life easier for all. For example, in Latin America, we reached an agreement for a co-brand deal with Telefonica, which will target Telefonica's mobile subscribers across 11 markets. We launched MasterCard MoneySend with the Bank of China, marking the 19th country where our person-to-person money transfer program is enabled. In the U.S., we worked closely with the MTA, PATH and NJ TRANSIT to expand our contactless PayPass pilot that will ultimately make commuting faster and easier for everyone involved." Banga concluded, "As a result of programs such as these, MasterCard remains well positioned for long-term growth."

Total operating expenses decreased 10.4%, to $648 million, during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were down 9.7%. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by a 14.5% decrease in general and administrative expenses, or 13.8% on a constant currency basis. This decrease was primarily due to lower personnel expense driven by decreased severance and compensation versus the year-ago quarter as a result of workforce reductions in 2009.
Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million, or 3.8%, in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Advertising and marketing expenses were essentially flat, down 0.3%, in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, advertising and marketing expenses increased 0.2%.
Operating margin was 52.6% for the second quarter of 2010, up 9.1 percentage points over the year-ago period.
Total other expense was $4 million in the second quarter of 2010 versus $21 million in the second quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by lower interest expense primarily due to a reduction in interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.7% in the second quarter of 2010, versus a rate of 35.0% in the comparable period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to discrete adjustments in the second quarter of 2010.
Year-to-Date 2010 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2010 MasterCard reported net income of $913 million, or $6.95 per diluted share.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2010, was $2.7 billion, an increase of 9.7% versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 9.0%. Cross-border volume growth of 13.1%, gross dollar volume growth of 8.4%, and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 5 percentage points, including the effect of cross-border rebates, contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by additional rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements.

Total operating expenses decreased 4.7%, to $1.3 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased 5.1% for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2009.
Operating margin was 53.0% for the six months ending June 30, 2010, up 7.1 percentage points over the year-ago period.
Total other expense was $9 million for the six-month period versus $32 million for the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2010, versus a rate of 34.1% in the comparable period in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete adjustments in each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010.

Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release which are not historical facts, including statements about MasterCard's plans, strategies, beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Accordingly, except for the company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forward-looking information to reflect actual results of operations, changes in financial condition, changes in estimates, expectations or assumptions, changes in general economic or industry conditions or other circumstances arising and/or existing since the preparation of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our ability to execute on programs that drive MasterCard's long-term growth.
Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including those set forth in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K that have been filed with the SEC during 2010, as well as reasons including difficulties, delays or the inability of the company to achieve its strategic initiatives set forth above.

Note that columns in the tables above may not add due to rounding; growth represents change from the comparable year-ago period.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board and at each annual meeting of stockholders prior to the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders commencing with the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire shall be elected for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Commencing with the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the foregoing classification of the Board of Directors shall cease. If the number of directors is changed prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each
 
class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. If the number of directors is increased at or following the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, any additional director elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from such increase shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. In no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director.
(C) A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; , that a quorum shall not be constituted unless directors who are neither Industry Directors nor officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries represent a majority of the directors present. Except as otherwise provided by law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board. "" means any director, other than a director who is an officer or employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, who is presently, or who has been, within the prior eighteen months, previously affiliated with a Member or Similar Person.
provided
Industry Director
(D) A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.
(E) Directors need not be elected by written ballot unless the by-laws shall so provide.
Section 6.2. . Any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office who are not Industry Directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director who is not an Industry Director. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the Board shall be comprised only of Industry Directors, any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, if any applicable provision of the DGCL expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes cast thereon by the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.
Board of Directors: Vacancies
Section 6.3. . Prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, directors may be removed with or without cause, but only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting as a single class. Commencing with the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, directors may be removed with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Removal of Directors
 
Section 6.4. . Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article VI unless expressly provided by such terms.
Election of Directors by Preferred Stock Holders
Section 7.1. . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders; , that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, or, to the extent expressly permitted by the certificate of designation relating to one or more series of Preferred Stock, by the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant class or series having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate or reduce the effect thereof in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article VIII would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment or repeal.
Limited Liability of Directors
 
Section 9.1. . To the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of Delaware as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify any person (and such person's heirs, executors or administrators) who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, including appeals, by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person was the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company, nonprofit entity or other enterprise, for and against all loss and liability suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred by such person or such heirs, executors or administrators in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.3, the Corporation shall be required to pay expenses of a person described in such sentence in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by such person was authorized by the Board.
Advance of Expenses
Section 9.3. . If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article IX is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by any person described in Section 9.1 has been received by the Corporation, such person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that such person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
Unpaid Claims
Section 9.4. . To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person described in Section 9.1 against any liability asserted against such person, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX or otherwise.

Section 9.5. . The provisions of this Article IX shall be applicable to all actions, claims, suits or proceedings made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after its adoption.

If any provision of this Article IX shall be found to be invalid or limited in application by reason of any law or regulation, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions hereof. The rights of indemnification provided in this Article IX shall neither be exclusive of, nor be deemed in limitation of, any rights to which any person may otherwise be or become entitled or permitted by contract, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the by-laws of the Corporation, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise, or as a matter of law, both as to actions in such person's official capacity and actions in any other capacity, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of any person whom the Corporation is obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 9.1 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
Section 9.6. For purposes of this Article IX, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries.
Section 9.7. This Article IX shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to, and purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of, persons other than persons described in Section 9.1.
Section 10.1. . If any provision or provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service to or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation; but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders present may, to the extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or
 
series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.

If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, convening the meeting and adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of record of the Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting, whether any stockholder or stockholder's proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the chairman of the meeting, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.

If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
DGCL
 
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6. may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate.
Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or applicable law or regulation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 8. (A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; , that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.
provided, however
(B)     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
Section 9. At any time when the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation permits action by one or more classes of stockholders of the Corporation to be taken by written consent, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents properly delivered in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, this section and the DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Section 10. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date) showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held
provided, however
 
at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
Section 11. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the Corporation or candidates for office. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Inspectors of stockholder votes shall, subject to the power of the chairman of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.
Section 12.
 
(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) delivered pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws, (b) by or at the direction of the Board or any committee thereof or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote on such election or such business at the meeting, who complied with the notice procedures set forth in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (A) of this By-Law and who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

provided, however
 
Section 1. The Board shall consist, subject to the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, of such number of directors, not less than three nor more than fifteen, as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of the majority of the Board.
Section 2. Prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors shall be divided into three classes in the manner set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, each class to be elected for the term set forth therein. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; provided, that a quorum shall not be constituted unless directors who are neither Industry Directors (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation) nor officers of the Corporation represent a majority of the directors present. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-Laws or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board.
Section 3. (A) Except as otherwise provided by these By-Laws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation, or at any time thereafter, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a ""), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 3, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election).
Contested Election
(B)     In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board for further service on the Board, such person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (a) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (b) acceptance of that proffered resignation by the Board in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board for such purpose. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board pursuant to these By-Laws, shall make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the proffered resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation within ninety (90) days following certification of the election results. The committee in making its recommendation and the Board in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.
(C)     If the Board accepts a director's resignation pursuant to this Section 3, or if a nominee for director who is not an incumbent director is not elected with a majority of votes in an election that is not a Contested Election, then the Board may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to Article II, Section 5 of these By-Laws.
 
Section 4. (A) The Board shall be comprised of directors at least 64% of whom the Board shall have determined are not Industry Directors (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation). Further, the number of directors who are neither Industry Directors nor officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall at all times be at least two greater than the number of directors who are either Industry Directors or officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.
(B)     A person shall qualify for election and continued service as a director of the Corporation only if the Board shall have determined that such person shall not:
(i) except in the case of an Industry Director or a director who is an officer or employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (x) be a director, officer, employee or agent of, or represent or otherwise be affiliated with, a Member (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation) or Similar Person (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation), (y) have been a director, officer, employee or agent of, or have represented or otherwise been affiliated with, a Member or Similar Person during the prior eighteen (18) months or (z) have any business relationship with a Member or Similar Person that is material to such person;
(ii) be a trustee, officer, employee or agent of, or represent or otherwise be affiliated with, The MasterCard Foundation, or have been a director, officer, employee or agent of, or have represented or otherwise been affiliated with, The MasterCard Foundation during the prior three years or otherwise have any business relationship with The MasterCard Foundation that is material to such person; or
(iii) be a director, regional board director, officer, employee or agent of, or represent (x) an entity that owns and/or operates a payment card program competitive with the Corporation's comparable card programs, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board (a "") or (y) an institution that is represented on any board of a Competitor.
Competitor
If at any time an individual fails to satisfy these qualifications, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, such individual shall automatically, without further action of the director, cease to be a director of the Corporation.
Section 5. Subject to the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, unless otherwise required by law, any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office who are not Industry Directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director who is not an Industry Director. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the Board shall be comprised only of Industry Directors, any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, if any applicable provision of the DGCL expressly confers power on
 
stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes cast thereon by the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.
Section 6. The Board shall appoint a director who is neither an Industry Director nor an officer of the Corporation to serve as a liaison between the Board and the board of directors of The MasterCard Foundation (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation) for the purpose of coordinating and facilitating communications between The MasterCard Foundation and the Corporation.

A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place, if any, at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting (except when the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing (including by electronic transmission).
Section 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class without one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto.
Section 9. If at any meeting for the election of directors, the Corporation has outstanding more than one class of stock, and one or more such classes or series thereof are entitled to vote separately as a class to elect directors, and there shall be a quorum of only one such class or series of stock, that class or series of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding absence of a quorum of the other class or series of stock.
 
Section 10. The Board may from time to time establish committees of the Board including, without limitation, an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee, to serve at the pleasure of the Board which shall be comprised of such members of the Board and have such duties as the Board shall from time to time establish.

The Board may also establish such other committees with such members (whether or not directors) and with such duties as the Board may from time to time determine. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, the By-Laws or the resolution of the Board designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced that MasterCard has entered into a Consent Decree with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The terms of the settlement are consistent with the Company's long standing business practices and will require MasterCard only to modify its rules to more specifically conform to its business practices. The resolution follows a two-year investigation involving an extensive review of MasterCard's acceptance rules and practices.
Purchase, NY, October 4, 2010 
"MasterCard's practices are both lawful and pro-competitive and we view this settlement as a great result. We are very pleased that after a comprehensive and lengthy investigation and intensive lobbying efforts by lawyers representing retailers in a pending lawsuit, this matter has been resolved without our having to substantially change our business practices." said Noah J. Hanft, MasterCard's General Counsel.
"The Consent Decree with the DOJ calls for modification of a rule to confirm that merchants may offer a discount for cash and all forms of payment, including competing brands, which is precisely what we already permit. Our discounting practices have long been more flexible than our major competitors and have permitted merchants to discount for cash, checks, debit cards or other payment brands."
MasterCard is also pleased that seven of the ten State Attorneys General who had requested information or opened investigations of MasterCard's merchant acceptance business practices have signed onto the DOJ Consent Decree and all ten have closed their investigations of MasterCard.
The Consent Decree is subject to review and approval by the Court.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter 2010. The company reported net income of $518 million, up 14.6%, and earnings per diluted share of $3.94, up 14.2%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, November 2, 2010 
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.4 billion, a 4.7% increase versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 7.3% compared to the same period in 2009, driven by the revenue impact of the following:
In addition, a pricing contribution of approximately 7 percentage points, including the effect of cross-border rebates, was offset by a net increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 7.9% on a local currency basis versus the third quarter of 2009, to $514 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 0.6% compared to the same period in 2009, to 5.8 billion. As of September 30, 2010, the company's customers had issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"Consumers and businesses around the world continue to recognize the benefits of electronic payments and MasterCard remains at the heart of this evolution," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Our year-to-date net income is up over 22%, aided by strong volume growth from markets outside of the U.S."
Banga commented, "Leveraging our global presence and differentiated assets, we continued to win new deals and execute against our three strategic pillars to grow, diversify and build MasterCard's business. We are growing our global debit portfolio with new agreements that include Sovereign Bank, Chevy Chase (now part of Capital One) and Delta Air Lines in the U.S., Barclaycard in Germany and Qatar Islamic Bank. We are expanding our presence in new markets and channels, reflected in our memorandum of understanding with China Union Pay and an agreement with Singtel, one of the larger mobile operators in Asia. We also completed our acquisition of DataCash which enhances our e-Commerce capabilities."

Total operating expenses decreased 4.1%, to $662 million, during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were down 2.6%. The decrease in total operating expenses was driven by a 6.7% reduction in general and administrative expenses, or 5.2% on a constant currency basis. This was due to lower personnel expense driven by decreased severance and compensation versus the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of workforce reductions in 2009.
Advertising and marketing expenses increased $8 million, or 4.7%, in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, advertising and marketing expenses increased 6.2%.
Operating margin was 53.6% for the third quarter of 2010, up 4.2 percentage points over the year-ago period.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.3% in the third quarter of 2010, versus a rate of 32.9% in the comparable period in 2009. The decrease was due primarily to benefits from the repatriation of foreign earnings and a lower state tax rate, partially offset by the impact of discrete adjustments in each of the three-month periods ending September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2010.
Year-to-Date 2010 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, MasterCard reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $10.89 per diluted share.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $4.1 billion, an increase of 7.9% versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 8.4%.
Cross-border volume growth of 13.9%, gross dollar volume growth of 8.5%, and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 6 percentage points, including the effect of cross-border rebates, contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by a net increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements.
Total operating expenses decreased 4.5%, to $1.9 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased 4.3%.
Operating margin was 53.2% for the nine months ending September 30, 2010, up 6.0 percentage points over the year-ago period.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
 
Total other expense was $8 million for the nine-month period versus $32 million for the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 34.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, versus a rate of 33.6% in the comparable period in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete adjustments in each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2010, partially offset by benefits from repatriation of foreign earnings and a lower state tax rate.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

(e) The Borrower's acceptance of CAF Advances in response to any CAF Advance Offers shall be subject to the following limitations:

(ii) the aggregate amount of CAF Advances accepted for all CAF Advance Maturity Dates specified by any Lender in its CAF Advance Offer shall not exceed the aggregate maximum amount specified in such CAF Advance Offer for all such CAF Advance Maturity Dates;
(iii) the Borrower may not accept offers for CAF Advances for any CAF Advance Maturity Date in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the maximum principal amount requested in the related CAF Advance Request; and
(iv) if the Borrower accepts any of such offers, it must accept offers based solely upon pricing for each relevant CAF Advance Maturity Date and upon no other criteria whatsoever, and if two or more Lenders submit offers for any CAF Advance Maturity Date at identical pricing and the Borrower accepts any of such offers but does not wish to (or, by reason of the limitations set forth in Section 2.8, cannot) borrow the total amount offered by such Lenders with such identical pricing, the Borrower shall accept offers from all of such Lenders in amounts allocated among them according to the amounts offered by such Lenders (with appropriate rounding, in the sole discretion of the Borrower, to assure that each accepted CAF Advance is an integral multiple of $1,000,000); that if the number of Lenders that submit offers for any CAF Advance Maturity Date at identical pricing is such that, after the Borrower accepts such

Interest accruing pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be payable from time to time on demand.
 
2.11 .

The Managing Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a London Interbank Offered Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.

Computation of Interest and Fees
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Managing Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Managing Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Managing Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.14(a) or 2.7(b).
2.16 . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
(a) the Managing Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period, or
(b) the Managing Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the London Interbank Offered Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
the Managing Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, and during such period until such circumstances described in paragraph (a) and (b) above cease to exist,

Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Managing Administrative Agent (it being understood that the Managing Administrative Agent shall promptly withdraw any such notice if the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above cease to exist) no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Loans, as the case may be.
2.17 . (a) Except as provided in Section 2.23(d), each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any facility fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on any Loans (other than any CAF Advance) shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Managing Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Managing Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.

If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
(b) Unless the Managing Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its allocable share of such borrowing available to the Managing Administrative Agent, the Managing Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Managing Administrative Agent, and the Managing Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Managing Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Managing Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Managing Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Managing Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to the Managing Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Managing Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower. If any such Lender shall subsequently pay its Commitment Percentage of such borrowing with interest thereon to the Managing Administrative Agent, the
 
Managing Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

If the aggregate amount of all Swing Line Commitments is at any time less than $1,250,000,000 (such shortfall, the ""), the Borrower may designate one or more of the other existing Lenders as Swing Line Lenders (it being understood that the Swing Line Commitments of any such Lender may, at the option of such Lender, exceed its Commitment), having Swing Line Commitments in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Swing Line Commitment Shortfall; that no Lender may be so designated unless it agrees in its sole discretion to act in such capacity. The Swing Line Commitment of each Swing Line Lender (unless otherwise agreed by such Swing Line Lender) shall be reduced as follows: (x) upon any reduction of the Commitment of any Lender that is also a Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4, the Swing Line Commitment of such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by the same proportion as such Commitment is so reduced and (y) upon any assignment by such Swing Line Lender of all or any portion of its Swing Line Commitment pursuant to subsection 9.6(c) and the assumption by the relevant assignee of the amount of such Swing Line Commitment so assigned, the Swing Line Commitment of such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by the amount of its Swing Line Commitment so assigned. During the Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swing Line Commitment by borrowing, prepaying the Swing Line Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. All Swing Line Loans shall bear interest based upon the ABR and shall not be entitled to be converted into loans that bear interest at any other rate.

The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, prepay the Swing Line Loans of such Swing Line Lender, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, by notifying such Swing Line Lender prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on any Business Day of the date and amount of prepayment. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.

Dear Sirs:
I am General Counsel of MasterCard Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the ""), and am familiar with the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2010 (the ""), among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions parties thereto (the ""), Citibank, N.A., as Managing Administrative Agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "").

Terms used herein which are defined in the Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.

Managing Administrative Agent

In connection with this opinion, I have examined an executed copy of the Agreement, and such corporate documents and records of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and officers of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and such other documents, as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures of, and the authority of, Persons signing the Agreement on behalf of parties thereto other than the Borrower, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
i. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation (provided that no opinion is given under this clause (a) with respect to any Subsidiary that is not a Material Subsidiary of the Borrower if the failure of such Subsidiary to be duly organized, validly existing or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect), (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good standing
under the laws of each jurisdiction (other than that of its organization) where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except in the case of (b) or (c), to the extent that the failure to have such power, authority and legal right or to qualify as a foreign entity or to be in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
ii. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Agreement are within the corporate powers of the Borrower, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no governmental approval, and do not contravene any law or regulation applicable to, including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the Board, or any contractual restriction binding on, the Borrower.
iii. The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance or validity of the Agreement other than those expressly required by the terms of the Agreement.
iv. To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, except to the extent set forth in Schedule 3.6 attached to the Agreement or as previously disclosed in any public filings made by the Borrower, there are no pending or threatened actions or proceedings affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely to the Borrower or such Subsidiary, could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
v. The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York and express no opinion on any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with respect to the Credit Agreement, that:

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(A) The enforceability of Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from or requiring indemnification of a party for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(C) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) Sections 9.6(b) and 9.7(b) of the Credit Agreement to the extent they purport to grant a right of set-off, (iii) Section 9.13(a) of the Credit Agreement, insofar as it relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of any court of the United States of America sitting in the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Loan Documents, (iv) Section 9.13(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as it relates to inconvenient forum with respect to any Federal court and (v) Section 9.9 of the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
This opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 4.1(g)(ii) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by us in our capacity as special New York counsel to the Agent and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, our prior written consent.

On December 9, 2010, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, announcing that it had agreed to the terms of a cash acquisition (the "Acquisition") of the prepaid card program management business (the "Business") of Travelex Holdings Ltd, a corporation formed under the laws of England and Wales ("Travelex"), including the issued and outstanding shares of Travelex Card Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Travelex, and the assets of certain other subsidiaries of Travelex related to the Business. The Business will be acquired by MasterCard Services Ltd ("MSL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On December 9, 2010, the Company will host a conference call to discuss the Acquisition. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in these exhibits is furnished but not filed.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, MSL will acquire the Business for an aggregate price of 290 million ($458 million), with additional consideration of up to 35 million ($55 million) if certain performance targets are met. The Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2011.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Travelex today announced that MasterCard has purchased the prepaid Card Program Management (CPM) operations of Travelex for 290 (US $458) million in cash, with an earn-out of up to an additional 35 (US $55) million if certain performance targets are met. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2011.
Purchase NY, and London UK, December 9, 2010
MasterCard is acquiring the Travelex operations that manage and deliver consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards to business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus. These operations also manage cross-border payroll, per-diem and expense-management prepaid cards for corporations. MasterCard has no plans to issue cards directly as a result of this transaction.
As part of the transaction, MasterCard and Travelex signed a long-term contract whereby MasterCard will provide program management services for the Travelex Cash Passport prepaid card sold through Travelex stores and online channels. Travelex, the world's largest foreign-exchange specialist, pioneered the growing prepaid travel card market with its Cash Passport card, which provides international travellers a more secure and convenient way to carry and spend money abroad.
The deal is an extension of a strong and long-term partnership between MasterCard and Travelex. Last year, the two companies expanded their relationship by agreeing to convert the majority of Travelex card programs to the MasterCard brand and by implementing the global prepaid transaction-processing capabilities of MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions (IPS). MasterCard IPS provides financial institutions world-class debit and prepaid processing solutions that are scalable, reliable, secure and flexible.
"The acquisition of Travelex's CPM operations underscores MasterCard's commitment to the global prepaid business, which remains a key strategic focus for us," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "This acquisition enables MasterCard to play a greater role in the prepaid value chain, allowing us to shape the future of prepaid, especially in high-growth markets and in the attractive cross-border payments space where we can displace cash and traveler's cheques."
Peter Jackson, CEO of Travelex, commented: "The sale of CPM will allow us to accelerate our investment plans, particularly in higher growth regions such as Asia and South America and in the growing e-commerce channel. MasterCard is a great partner of Travelex and we are also pleased to continue to offer our customers the benefits of the Travelex Cash Passport. The sale follows a strong year for the Group in which we have continued to extend our global footprint and deliver a strong performance."
The acquisition furthers MasterCard's strategic business goals. Adding Travelex's CPM operations strengthens MasterCard's suite of global prepaid business assets allowing the company to focus on countries outside of the U.S. to accelerate prepaid market entry and growth. The transaction is consistent with MasterCard's commitment to working with partners and issuers around the world to issue MasterCard prepaid cards and deliver the most innovative prepaid card solutions to the marketplace.

For Travelex, the sale will provide further resources to continue to invest across the Group. Travelex remains focused on growing its consumer foreign exchange and international payments business for its retail and corporate customers with further expansion in fast growing emerging markets, including areas of Asia and South America. The retail distribution of cards through Travelex channels also remains a strategic priority. As part of the transaction, Travelex has agreed with its lenders to use part of the proceeds to reduce its senior debt facilities.
Prepaid is one of the fastest-growing payment card categories. According to a 2010 Boston Consulting Group study commissioned by MasterCard, prepaid is expected to reach more than $840 billion in global volume by 2017, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent. This same study estimates that the prepaid open-loop market in the travel sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31 percent over the same period.
MasterCard expects the transaction to be $0.04 dilutive to its 2011 earnings per share due to amortization and one time transaction and integration costs. For 2012, MasterCard expects the transaction to be neutral and accretive beginning in 2013.
At 9:00 a.m. ET today, MasterCard will host a conference call to discuss the transaction. The dial-in information for this call is 866-277-1184 (within the U.S.) and 617-597-5360 (outside the U.S.) and the passcode is 18055271.

(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter 2010. The company reported net income of $415 million, up 41.2%, and earnings per diluted share of $3.16, up 41.1%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, February 3, 2011
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1.4 billion, a 10.7% increase versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 13.0% compared to the same period in 2009. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 10.8% on a local currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2009, to $567 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 6.3% compared to the same period in 2009, to 6.2 billion. As of December 31, 2010, the company's customers had issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"2010 proved to be a good year for MasterCard. Our business momentum was fueled by products and solutions that create efficiencies for cardholders, businesses and governments while driving future growth," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Importantly, our strategic investmentsincluding the acquisition of DataCash, our pending acquisition of Travelex's program management business and the Telefnica joint venturewill continue to enhance our e-Commerce, prepaid, and mobile capabilities, positioning us at the forefront of global payments innovation."
Banga continued, "We are pleased to have ended the year with a strong fourth quarter. Our net revenue was up almost 11%, with underlying growth showing quarter-over-quarter improvement in all regions, and our operating income grew nearly 22%."
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
Total operating expenses increased 4.6%, to $869 million, during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 6.1%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, operating income increased 21.6% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 39.6%.
MasterCard reported other income of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus other expense of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The change was driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to a litigation settlement, lower interest on tax liabilities and an increase in investment income.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 28.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010, versus a rate of 35.8% in the comparable period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a benefit recorded in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
Full-Year 2010 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2010, MasterCard reported net income of $1.8 billion, or $14.05 per diluted share.
Net revenue for the full-year 2010 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 8.6% versus 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 9.5%. Cross-border volume growth of 15.2% and gross dollar volume growth of 9.1%, contributed to the net revenue growth in the full-year period. In addition, a pricing contribution of approximately 5 percentage points was offset by an increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Total operating expenses decreased 1.8%, to $2.8 billion, for 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower personnel costs, partially offset by increased expense related to strategic initiatives, marketing and travel and entertainment. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased 1.1%.
Operating income increased 21.8% for 2010 versus 2009. The company's operating margin was 49.7% for the full-year period.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
Total other income was $5 million for the full-year 2010 versus total other expense of $42 million in 2009. This was driven by a decrease in interest expense primarily due to lower interest accretion related to previous litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 33.0% for the full-year 2010, versus a rate of 34.1% for the full-year 2009. The decrease was primarily due to benefits recorded in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") and its principal operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International", and together with the Company, "MasterCard"), have executed:
 
 
The Agreements have been executed by all parties with financial responsibility thereunder. The MasterCard JSA has been fully executed by all parties other than two affiliates of a Defendant Bank which has financial responsibility under the Agreements and has already executed both Agreements. The Omnibus JSA has been executed by all parties other than the same two affiliates and one additional party who has no financial responsibility under either of the Agreements. Thus, in all cases, the parties that have not yet signed have no financial responsibility under the Agreements. Both of the Agreements will become effective upon execution by the parties that have not yet signed. The Company anticipates that these signings will occur shortly. If the Agreements are not fully executed, neither the MasterCard JSA nor the Omnibus JSA will become effective.
The Agreements are with respect to the current litigations with both the proposed class of merchants and individual merchants that are currently being litigated in the Eastern District of New York ("MDL 1720"), as well as any other potential future case that is transferred at any time for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to MDL 1720 in which the parties are or may become co-defendants (collectively, the "Merchant Litigations"). The Agreements provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which MasterCard, Visa and the Defendant Banks may incur, jointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or global settlement of one or all of the cases in the Merchant Litigations. The Merchant Litigations generally concern allegations by the merchants that, among other things, MasterCard and Visa's purported setting of interchange fees violates antitrust laws. The Merchant Litigations are described in more detail in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
The Omnibus JSA provides that the overall responsibility of MasterCard, Visa and the Defendant Banks for the Merchant Litigations would be divided into a "Visa portion" of 66.6667% and a "MasterCard portion" of 33.3333% in the event of either:
 
 
The MasterCard JSA provides the specific percentage of financial responsibility for MasterCard and the Defendant Banks with respect to the MasterCard portion of any global settlement of, or adverse judgment in, the Merchant Litigations.
With regard to MasterCard's settlement sharing responsibilities under the Agreements:
 
 
 
With regard to MasterCard's judgment sharing responsibilities under the Agreements:
 
 
MasterCard continues to defend the claims in the Merchant Litigations and the Agreements in no way serve as an admission as to the validity of the allegations in the merchant complaints. MasterCard continues to believe that it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to, any of the Merchant Litigations. Accordingly, no provision for losses has been provided in connection with the Merchant Litigations.
The information set forth in this Form 8-K is furnished, not filed.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this Form 8-K which are not historical facts, including statements about MasterCard's expectations with respect to the MasterCard JSA and the Omnibus JSA becoming effective, are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 7, 2011, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2011 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on July 30, 2010) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2011 under the SEAICP are based upon the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and net revenue targets. Actual bonus award amounts will be based upon a weighting of two-thirds for actual performance achieved against the net income target and one-third for actual performance achieved against the net revenue target. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2011 annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On February 8, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing that its 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2011 Annual Meeting") will be held on June 7, 2011. Consistent with the expectations stated in the Company's proxy statement (the "2010 Proxy Statement") for its 2010 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2010 Annual Meeting"), the 2011 Annual Meeting is returning to its typical June timing (after having been held in September in 2010). The Company indicated in the 2010 Proxy Statement that it was likely that the deadlines for submissions of stockholder proposals and director nominations in 2011 would be changed to earlier dates.
Because the date of the 2011 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days prior to the anniversary of the 2010 Annual Meeting, the Company has set a new deadline for the receipt of stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 ("Rule 14a-8") under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2011 Annual Meeting. In order to be considered timely, any such proposal must be received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company at 2000 Purchase Street, Purchase, New York 10577 no later than March 9, 2011. Proposals submitted under Rule 14a-8 must also meet the other requirements of Rule 14a-8 or otherwise may be omitted.
Additionally, because the expected date of the 2011 Annual Meeting is more than 20 days before the anniversary of the 2010 Annual Meeting, in accordance with the advanced notice provisions set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated By-laws (the "By-laws"), the Company has set new deadlines for a stockholder to properly bring nominations of directors or any other business before the 2011 Annual Meeting. Notice of such nominations or business, in order to be timely, must be received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company at 2000 Purchase Street, Purchase, New York 10577 no earlier than February 7, 2011 and no later than the close of business on March 9, 2011. If a stockholder's nomination or proposal for business to be brought before the meeting is not in compliance with the requirements set forth in the By-laws, the Company may disregard such nomination or business.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 3, 2011, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 3, 2011, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter ended March 31, 2011 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
- MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter 2011. The company reported net income of $562 million, up 23.6%, and earnings per diluted share of $4.29, up 24.0%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, May 3, 2011
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was $1.5 billion, a 14.8% increase versus the same period in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations had essentially no impact on net revenue growth which was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 12.9% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2010, to $545 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 11.1% compared to the same period in 2010, to 6.0 billion. As of March 31, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We had a strong start to 2011 despite the hardships experienced by many consumers and businesses due to natural disasters and political turmoil in several markets. Our solid volume and processed transaction growth helped to drive a double-digit revenue increase. This growth is reflective of the strong fundamentals and globality of our business," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer.
"We continue to launch new products, enter new geographies and open new acceptance channels. We launched Travelex Cash Passport in Brazil and South Africa and recently completed our acquisition of the Card Program Management assets of Travelex, allowing us to further build our global prepaid presence. During the quarter, we also signed a long-term debit renewal with Poste Italiane, one of our largest debit issuers in Europe."

Total operating expenses increased 9.4%, to $665 million, during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on overall operating expenses. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
In the first quarter of 2011, operating income increased 19.4% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 55.7%.
MasterCard reported no other income or expense in the first quarter of 2011 versus other expense of $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. The change was driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to a litigation settlement.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.8% in the first quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 34.6% in the comparable period in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings.
Through quarter end, the company had repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of class A common stock at a cost of $654 million under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized on September 14, 2010. On April 12, 2011, MasterCard's board of directors amended its share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase an incremental $1 billion of class A common stock, bringing the authorization to an aggregate of $2 billion. As of April 28, 2011, the company had completed the repurchase of approximately 3.9 million shares of class A common stock at a cost of $1 billion.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receiptor enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Ms. Qureshi has not yet been appointed to any committees of the Board. A copy of the press release, issued by the Company on April 29, 2011, announcing this election is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

On August 3, 2011, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.

On August 3, 2011, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter ended June 30, 2011 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2011. The company reported net income of $608 million, up 32.8%, and earnings per diluted share of $4.76, up 36.4%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, August 3, 2011
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 22.1% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 18.0%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 16.3% on a local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2010, to $608 billion. As of June 30, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"Solid global performance, including strong increases in volume and processed transactions, fueled double-digit revenue growth this quarter," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "While payment volumes have risen across our base customers, we're also seeing new business such as the portfolio conversions of SunTrust and Sovereign, as well as new processing relationships in the Netherlands and in Brazil, contribute to growth."
Banga said, "During the quarter, work continued in the mobile commerce category highlighted by an agreement with Google and multiple partners to launch the Google Wallet, as well as our alliance with Isis, in the U.S. Additionally, the previously announced Orange and Barclaycard contactless mobile payment service became available to U.K. consumers in May. Other notable agreements we executed include a commercial alliance with China Union Pay to enable its cards for cross-border e-Commerce, and a new, multi-product agreement with Swedbank in the Nordics and Baltics region."

Total operating expenses increased 20.8%, to $782 million, during the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 17.1%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19% and operating expenses grew approximately 14%.
Operating income increased 23.3%, or 18.9% on a constant currency basis, over the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 53.1%, up from 52.6% in the second quarter of 2010.
MasterCard reported other income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus other expense of $4 million in the second quarter of 2010. This change was mainly driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to litigation settlements and lower interest on uncertain tax positions.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.8% in the second quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 35.7% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2011 and discrete adjustments in the second quarter of 2010.
In April 2011, MasterCard's board of directors amended its share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase an incremental $1 billion of class A common stock, bringing the authorization to an aggregate of $2 billion. During the second quarter, MasterCard repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $387 million. Quarter-to-date through July 28, the company repurchased an additional 77,700 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $24 million, with $935 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2011 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $1.2 billion, up 28.2%, and earnings per diluted share of $9.05, up 30.2%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 18.5% versus the same period in 2010, or 16.4% on a constant currency basis. Cross-border volume growth of
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
18.9%, gross dollar volume growth of 14.7%, transaction processing growth of 14.3% and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 3 percentage points contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Total operating expenses increased 15.3%, to $1.4 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 13.5%.
Operating margin was 54.3% for the six months ending June 30, 2011, up from 53.0% in the first half of 2010.
Total other income was $7 million for the six-month period versus other expense of $9 million for the same period in 2010. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to litigation settlements and lower interest on uncertain tax positions.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2011, versus a rate of 35.1% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2011.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2011. The company reported net income of $717 million, up 38.4%, and earnings per diluted share of $5.63, up 42.9%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, November 2, 2011 
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was $1.8 billion, a 27.3% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 23.8%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 17.2% on a local currency basis versus the third quarter of 2010, to $628 billion. As of September 30, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our strong results this quarter, which were driven by several factors including double-digit increases in volumes and processed transactions in most regions across the globe," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Debit portfolio conversions in the U.S. and new transaction processing in Brazil and the Netherlands continue to contribute to this growth.
"Economic indicators across the world remain mixed, with the uncertainties in Europe and the United States weighing on sentiment and dominating headlines. Nonetheless, we continue to focus on displacing cash and winning share across markets. We will be adding to our domestic processing in Italy as we have signed a multi-year agreement with a major bank to convert their debit cards to Maestro-only from a co-brand with a domestic scheme. In the U.S., Huntington Bank recently announced a conversion to MasterCard debit cards and will be implementing our IPS platform. We also continue to work with governments around the world, most recently in India and Mexico, to replace some of their paper-based, manual procurement systems with MasterCard commercial products."

Total operating expenses increased 23.1%, to $816 million, during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 20.8%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
 
In the third quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 24% and operating expenses grew approximately 15%.
Operating income increased 30.9%, or 26.3% on a constant currency basis, over the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 55.1%, up from 53.6% in the third quarter of 2010.
MasterCard reported other income of $28 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus other income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was mainly driven by realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions and a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 30.5% in the third quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 32.3% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the third quarter of 2011.
During the third quarter of 2011, MasterCard repurchased 250,100 shares at a cost of approximately $77 million. Quarter-to-date through October 27, the company repurchased an additional 10,900 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $3 million, with $879 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2011 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $1.9 billion, up 31.9%, and earnings per diluted share of $14.66, up 34.6%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $5.0 billion, an increase of 21.6% versus the same period in 2010, or 19.0% on a constant currency basis. Cross-border volume
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
growth of 19.1%, gross dollar volume growth of 16.0%, transaction processing growth of 16.5% and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 3 percentage points contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Total operating expenses increased 18.0%, to $2.3 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 16.0%.
Year-to-date through September 30, 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19% and operating expenses grew approximately 11%.
Operating margin was 54.6% for the nine months ending September 30, 2011, up from 53.2% in the same period last year.
Total other income was $35 million for the nine-month period versus other expense of $8 million for the same period in 2010. The change was mainly driven by realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions and a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, versus a rate of 34.2% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, as well as discrete adjustments recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.

 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding a special item, the company reported net income of $514 million, up 23.7%, and earnings per diluted share of $4.03, up 27.5%, in each case versus the year-ago period. Including the special item, a $495 million after-tax charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations, the company reported net income of $19 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. The company's total operating expenses, operating income, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding the special item, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, February 2, 2012
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 20.2% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 20.8% compared to the same period in 2010. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 15.2% on a local currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2010, to $648 billion. As of December 31, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results as we are seeing sustained momentum driven by new deals and the ongoing shift away from paper-based payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "For the full year, despite ongoing economic uncertainties, we posted strong performance ahead of our long-term objectives.
"Solid execution at the local level continued to result in new business wins in 2011, with a recent agreement from KeyBank that includes PIN debit and our IPS platform, as well as credit and debit deals with nearly 150 U.S.-based independent banks and credit unions. Additionally, we continue to lay the foundation for growth through strategic partnerships with Western Union, Telefnica and Intel to provide consumers in developed and emerging markets with access to more efficient and safer forms of electronic payments," Banga concluded.

Based on progress to date in mediation related to the U.S. merchant litigations, the company recorded a $770 million pre-tax charge, or $495 million on an after-tax basis, in the fourth quarter of 2011. This special item represents the company's financial portion of a potential settlement in these cases.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 11.5%, to $968 million, during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on operating expense growth. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including the special item, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 100.1% versus the year-ago period, to $1.7 billion.
Excluding the special item, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 33.5% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 44.0%.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 18%; excluding acquisitions and the special item, operating expenses grew approximately 8%.
MasterCard reported other expense of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus other income of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income, lower realized gains on sales of investments and equity losses in joint ventures versus the year-ago period.
Excluding the special item, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 28.7% in the comparable period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a benefit recorded in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the current period. Including the special item, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was a 251.6% benefit, as the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations is tax deductible in the U.S. and thus impacted the geographic mix of pre-tax income.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, MasterCard repurchased 84,300 shares at a cost of approximately $30 million. Quarter-to-date through January 27, the company repurchased an additional 304,600 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $106 million, with $746 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.

Full-Year 2011 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $2.4 billion, or $18.70 per diluted share, excluding a special item, and net income of $1.9 billion, or $14.85 per diluted share, including the special item. The special item represents the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations taken in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Net revenue for full-year 2011 was $6.7 billion, an increase of 21.2% versus 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 19.5%. Cross-border volume growth of 18.7%, gross dollar volume growth of 16.1% and processed transaction growth of 18.3%, contributed to the net revenue growth in the full-year period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 16.0%, to $3.2 billion, for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives and the inclusion of expenses related to acquisitions. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 14.5%. Including the special item, operating expenses in 2011 increased 43.6%, to $4.0 billion, versus 2010.
For the full-year 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19%; excluding acquisitions and the special item, operating expenses grew approximately 10%.
Excluding the special item, operating income increased 26.6% for 2011 versus 2010 delivering an operating margin of 51.9% for the full-year period. Including the special item, the operating margin was 40.4% for full-year 2011.
Total other income was $33 million for full-year 2011 versus total other income of $5 million in 2010. This was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to previous litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding the special item, was 31.8% for full-year 2011, versus a rate of 33.0% for full-year 2010. Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 30.6% for full-year 2011. The decrease in the 2011 effective tax rate was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings, including the tax benefit related to the special item, and the recognition of discrete adjustments in 2011 and 2010.
For full-year 2011, MasterCard repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion.

On February 6, 2012, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2012 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on April 29, 2011) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2012 under the SEAICP are based upon the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and net revenue targets. Actual bonus award amounts will be based upon a weighting of two-thirds for actual performance achieved against the net income target and one-third for actual performance achieved against the net revenue target. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2012 annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
Also on February 6, 2012, the Compensation Committee approved an increase to the annual base salary of Ajay Banga, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, to $1,000,000 from $900,000, to be effective March 1, 2012.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Martina Hund-Mejean, Chief Financial Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A common stock") for personal financial management and tax planning purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan, which will increase Ms. Hund-Mejean's overall net share holdings, allows for: (i) the exercise of 7,500 shares of Class A common stock underlying stock option awards, with Ms. Hund-Mejean selling sufficient shares to cover the stock option exercise cost as well as taxes due in respect of the vested stock options while she continues to own the underlying shares following the stock option exercise (the "Net Shares"), and (ii) the simultaneous sale of an amount of shares of Class A common stock (associated with restricted stock unit awards) greater than the Net Shares. Accordingly, following these transactions, Ms. Hund-Mejean's overall number of shares of Class A common stock expected to be owned would increase. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to specified limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as May 15, 2012 and will end no later than July 15, 2012. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Ms. Hund-Mejean will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby she is encouraged to hold at least four times her base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Ms. Hund-Mejean are included; however, restricted stock units, performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2012. The company reported net income of $682 million, up 21%, and earnings per diluted share of $5.36, up 25%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, May 2, 2012
Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a 17% increase versus the same period in 2011. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 19% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 17% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2011, to $629 billion. As of March 31, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We had a good start to the year with solid first quarter results driven by an increase in processed transactions, the highest quarterly growth rate since our IPO, as well as positive volume growth in all regions as consumers continue to adopt electronic payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "We are leveraging opportunities around the world. In the U.S., we have significantly improved our position in debit and now have the capability to process transactions on about half of all U.S. debit cards. Outside of the U.S., the acquisitions of DataCash and Access Prepaid Worldwide are delivering growth, both showing roughly 25% operational increases."
Total operating expenses increased 14%, to $758 million, during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, operating expenses grew 15%. The increase was primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses. Excluding the acquisition of Access Prepaid, net revenue grew approximately 16% and operating expenses grew approximately 9%.

MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.8% in the first quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 32.8% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings this year.
During the first quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased 652,500 shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. Quarter-to-date through April 26, the company repurchased an additional 112,300 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $49 million, with $556 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On July 13, 2012, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") and its operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International" and, together with the Company, "MasterCard"), entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation in the Eastern District of New York in case captioned MDL 1720. Separately, MasterCard has also reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims brought by the individual merchant plaintiffs.
The MOU sets out a binding obligation to enter into a settlement agreement (the "Class Settlement Agreement") in the form attached to the MOU. The settlement is subject to: (1) the successful completion of certain appendices, (2) the successful negotiation of a settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs, (3) final court approval of the class settlement and (4) any necessary internal approvals for the parties.
MasterCard's share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790 million on a pre-tax basis. As a result, MasterCard will incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its second quarter 2012 financial statements. MasterCard had previously recorded a $770 million charge in its fourth quarter 2011 financial statements. MasterCard's financial obligation was based upon the allocation of financial responsibility that was set out in the judgment and settlement sharing agreements that were executed in February 2011 by the Company, MasterCard International and, as applicable, Visa, Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association and MasterCard's customer banks that are parties thereto. Pursuant to those agreements, MasterCard's responsibility is for 12% of a global settlement of the matter. The $790 million obligation represents MasterCard's 12% share of the class settlement set forth in the Class Settlement Agreement of $6.05 billion, along with its 12% share of the cash portion settlement with the individual merchant plaintiffs.
The Class Settlement Agreement includes the following terms, among others:
 
 
 
 
The above description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the MOU, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated
 
herein by reference. The MOU includes a copy of the Class Settlement Agreement which the parties have committed to execute, subject to the conditions described above.
Item 8.01 Other Events

Settlement Classes
2.      The Class Plaintiffs will seek, and the Defendants will not oppose, the Court's certification of two settlement classes for settlement purposes only, defined as follows.
(a)      A "Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class" under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3), from which exclusions shall be permitted, consisting of all persons, businesses, and other entities that have accepted Visa-Branded Cards and/or MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States at any time from January 1, 2004 to the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, except that this Class does not include the named Defendants, their directors, officers, or members of their families, financial institutions that have issued Visa- or MasterCard-Branded Cards or acquired Visa- or MasterCard-Branded Card transactions at any time from January 1, 2004 to the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, or the United States government.
(b)      A "Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class" under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), from which exclusions shall not be permitted, consisting of all
 
persons, businesses, and other entities that as of the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date or in the future accept any Visa-Branded Cards and/or MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, except that this Class shall not include the named Defendants, their directors, officers, or members of their families, financial institutions that have issued Visa- or MasterCard-Branded Cards or acquired Visa- or MasterCard-Branded Card transactions at any time since January 1, 2004, or do so in the future, or the United States government.
3.    The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants stipulate and agree that, in paragraph 108 of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, paragraph 258 of the First Amended Supplemental Class Action Complaint, and paragraph 223 of the Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint, the definitions of "Class I" are amended to be the same as the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and the definitions of "Class II" are amended to be the same as the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and that the Court's orders preliminarily and finally approving this Settlement Agreement must so amend those Operative Class Complaints.
4.    The Class Plaintiffs will seek, and the Defendants will not oppose, the Court's appointment of the law firms of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., Berger & Montague, P.C., and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as Class Counsel to represent the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class.
5.    The Class Plaintiffs agree that they (a) will not seek to become Opt Outs or otherwise exclude themselves from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, or in any way, by class definition or otherwise, seek to exclude themselves from the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and (b) will not object to the Court's preliminary or final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement. The Class Plaintiffs will seek, and on the basis of and in reliance on this commitment the Defendants will not oppose, the Court's appointment of the Class Plaintiffs as
 
the representative members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class.
Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
6.    Within seven business days after execution of this Class Settlement Agreement, the Class Counsel, the Visa Defendants, and the MasterCard Defendants shall establish the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreements provided in Appendices B and C hereto. Funds in those Escrow Account(s) shall be invested solely as provided in Appendices B and C hereto. The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that each Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account and each Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account is intended to be and shall be treated as a Qualified Settlement Fund within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.468B-1 and any analogous local, state, and/or foreign statute, law, regulation, or rule. No signature or approval from the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants shall be required for disbursement from any of the Escrow Account(s) commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date.
7.    All Taxes with respect to any sums in any Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account or any Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account, the administrative costs of paying such Taxes, and any other costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering that Escrow Account shall be paid from that Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent(s).
8.    No payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), or any other use of those Escrow Account(s), shall be made without the prior approval of the Court (which may include approval of payments consistent with proposed budgets and expenses). Class Plaintiffs shall provide Defendants with prior notice of any applications to the Court for such approvals sought up to ten business days
 
after the Settlement Final Date. In no event shall any Defendant, or any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party, have any obligation, responsibility, or liability arising from or relating to the administration, maintenance, preservation, investment, use, allocation, adjustment, distribution, disbursement, or disposition of any funds in the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
Payments to the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
9.      The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that the Total Cash Payment Amount shall be $6,050,000,000.
10.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, (a) the Visa Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), from the litigation escrow account established under the Visa Defendants' Retrospective Responsibility Plan, two-thirds of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $4,033,333,333), and (b) the MasterCard Defendants and Bank Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) a total of one-third of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $2,016,666,667) in accordance with the agreement among themselves regarding their respective shares.
11.    If this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated prior to the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make a Default Interchange Payment by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s). Those Default Interchange Payments shall be made within sixty days after the completion of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated during the eight-month period. If this Class Settlement Agreement terminates during the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, within sixty days of such termination,
 
the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make their respective Default Interchange Payment based only on the portion of the eight-month period that preceded the date of termination. In the event of a termination of this Class Settlement Agreement after the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, any Default Interchange Payments made to the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) by the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall be distributed in a manner determined by the Court, if the parties do not enter into a new Class Settlement Agreement addressing such distribution, and in no event shall those Default Interchange Payments revert to the Visa Defendants or MasterCard Defendants or be distributed to Bank Defendants.
12.    The Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the Visa Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same date of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier or, if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the Visa Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants. The Visa Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default
 
Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the Visa Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any Visa-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the Visa Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
13.    The Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the MasterCard Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same day of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier, or if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the MasterCard Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants. The MasterCard Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the MasterCard Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for
 
MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any MasterCard-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the MasterCard Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
14.    Class Plaintiffs reserve their rights to seek appropriate relief from the Court in the event the payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above are not timely made, including but not limited to relief consisting of immediate payment, interest, and penalties.
15.    The payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above shall exhaust and fully satisfy any and all payment obligations under this Class Settlement Agreement of the Defendants and any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties, and shall extinguish entirely any further obligation, responsibility, or liability to pay any notice expenses, attorneys' fees, litigation costs, costs of administration, Taxes, settlement sums, or sums of any kind to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), or to the Class Plaintiffs or other members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class (other than those who opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class), or to any of their respective counsel, experts, advisors, agents, and representatives, all of whom shall look solely to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) for settlement and satisfaction of all claims released in this Class Settlement Agreement.
Payments from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
16.    Prior to the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of
 
paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs, including the costs of the Notice Plan and the exclusion procedures for Opt Outs as provided in Paragraphs 79-93 below, and additional costs for claims administration, in amounts consistent with the limitations of Paragraph 21(c) below.
17.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 18-20 below, in the amounts stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, regardless of any appeal or other challenge made to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments or their amount. In the event of any appeal concerning the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, and which results in a order determining that those amounts should be modified, within ten business days after the Settlement Final Date the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall pay any amounts to be refunded by wire transfer to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), and the Escrow Agents(s) shall pay any increased amounts due to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants into an account that they shall designate.
18.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class
 
Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
19.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
20.    In the event that the sum of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments as calculated in Paragraphs 18 and 19 above would exceed twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000), and Defendants do not elect to terminate this Class Settlement Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 97 below, the payments under Paragraphs 18 and 19 above instead shall be calculated as provided in this Paragraph 20. The payment under Paragraph 18 to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (w) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 18(a) by the sum of the sales described in
 
Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (x) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. The payment under Paragraph 19 to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (y) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 19(a) by the sum of the sales described in Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (z) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. Prior to such payments, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants will disclose in writing to Class Counsel the amount of those two payments, which when added together must be equal to twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000).
21.    From the Settlement Final Approval Date to the date twenty business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 17-20 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in amounts approved by the Court for (a) the costs of maintaining or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), (b) Expense Awards in an amount not to exceed a collective total of $30 million, and (c) further approved Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
22.    The Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above may be paid only to the law firms that are Class Counsel, which law firms may further disseminate such funds to other law firms representing plaintiffs in the Class Actions, but subject to the terms of this Paragraph. In the event that any Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above are overturned or reduced on any appeal or otherwise, or in the event this
 
Class Settlement Agreement is terminated by the date ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, each Class Counsel law firm that received such Expense Awards (whether those Awards were retained or dissemination to other law firms) shall, within ten business days of receiving notice thereof, refund all overturned Expense Awards, or the amount by which any Expense Awards were reduced, to those Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), with interest thereon for the period from payment to refund at the same rate as earned on the funds deposited into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), the basis for which rate shall be disclosed to Defendants Any Class Counsel law firm that receives Expense Awards pursuant to Paragraph 21(b) above agrees that it, and each member or shareholder of that law firm, is jointly and severally liable solely for the amount of the Expense Awards that the Class Counsel law firm received and that must be refunded (whether those Awards were retained or disseminated to other law firms), are subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court for the enforcement of the obligation to make such refunds, and are liable for any attorneys' fees and costs that Defendants incur in recovering any such funds that must be refunded, and that the release provided to that law firm in Paragraphs 37 and 73 below shall not extend to any claims regarding such refunds.
.
23.    Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, if this Class Settlement Agreement has not been terminated, and subject to the approval of the Court, the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) may be used for paying Attorney Fee Awards, Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and Expense Awards not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above, as approved by the Court.
24.    Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the payments provided in Paragraphs 16-23 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) in amounts approved by the Court
 
based on applications filed with the Court and served on the Defendants, including for paying (a) the timely and proper claims of Authorized Cash Claimants pursuant to the Plan of Administration and Distribution approved by the Court, and (b) Settlement Administration Costs not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above that are approved by the Court.
25.    Until ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
26.    Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Interchange Accounts in amounts approved by the Court based on applications filed with the Court and served on Defendants, including for paying the timely and proper claims of members of Authorized Interchange Claimants pursuant to the Plan of Administration and Distribution approved by the Court.
27.    Notwithstanding anything in Paragraphs 6-26 above, in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated as provided in Paragraphs 96-98 below, the Escrow Agent(s) shall promptly pay two-thirds of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and already paid or incurred, to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, and shall promptly pay one-third of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any
 
Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and paid or incurred, to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate.

(h)    the future effect in the United States of any conduct of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party substantially similar to the conduct of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party related to or arising out of interchange rules, interchange fees, or interchange rates, any Rule of any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant modified or to be modified pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement, any other Rule of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant in effect as of the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, or any Rule substantially similar to any of the foregoing Rules;
(i)    any conduct of this Action, including without limitation any settlement discussions relating to this Action, the negotiation of and agreement to this Class Settlement Agreement by the Defendants or any member or customer financial institution of the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants, or any terms or effect of this Class Settlement Agreement (other than claims to enforce this Class Settlement Agreement), including any
 
changes in the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties' Rules as a result of this Class Settlement Agreement;
and it is expressly agreed, for purposes of clarity, without expanding or limiting the foregoing, that any claims based on or relating to (a)-(i) above are claims that were or could have been alleged in this Action.
34.    Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party further expressly and irrevocably waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles and releases, any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party may have or that may be derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the release contained in the preceding Paragraphs 31-33. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party expressly and irrevocably waives and releases any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party might otherwise have in relation to the release by virtue of the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or similar laws of any other state or jurisdiction.

In addition, although each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party may hereafter discover facts other than, different from, or in addition to those that it or he or she knows or believes to be true with respect to any claims released in the preceding Paragraphs 31-33, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party hereby expressly waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles, discharges, and releases, any known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or
 
non-contingent claims within the scope of the preceding Paragraphs 31-33, whether or not concealed or hidden, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such other, different, or additional facts. Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class shall be deemed by operation of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Class Settlement Agreement.
35.    Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party covenants and agrees that it shall not, hereafter, seek to establish, or permit another to act for it in a representative capacity to seek to establish, liability against any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties based, in whole or in part, upon any conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 31-34 above.
36.    For avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Class Settlement Agreement releases any claim of a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on:
(a)    breach of this Class Settlement Agreement;
(b)    standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty, misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 31-35 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or
 
any other Rule fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 31-35 above; or
(c)    the claims alleged in the currently operative complaints against the current defendants in (i) , No. 11-CV-02075-RJL (D.D.C.), and (ii) , No. 04-CV-02676-CRB (N.D. Cal) (including claims that have been asserted to have been alleged in the Second Amended and Third Amended Complaints against Bank of America, N.A.).

Each Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Class Plaintiffs, the other plaintiffs in the Class Actions, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement.
38.    In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 below, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 31-37 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.

Paragraph, and/or (z) whether Visa negotiated in good faith with the putative buying group. The parties, including all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, waive all rights to appeal from any such determinations. Upon resolution of the dispute by the Court, the losing party shall be responsible for all attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing party unless the Court determines that the circumstances make such an award unjust.

States as of the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, any Rule modified or to be modified pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement, or any Rule that is substantially similar to any Rule in effect in the United States as of the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order or any Rule modified or to be modified pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement;
(h)    the future effect in the United States of any conduct of any Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party substantially similar to the conduct of any Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party related to or arising out of interchange rules, interchange fees, or interchange rates, any Rule of any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant modified or to be modified pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement, any other Rule of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant in effect as of the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, or any Rule substantially similar to any of the foregoing Rules;

and it is expressly agreed, for purposes of clarity, without expanding or limiting the foregoing, that any claims based on or relating to (a)-(i) above are claims that were or could have been alleged in this Action.
Provided, however, that any Opt Out that is also a member of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall not be deemed to have released any claims for damages based on any
 
Rules or other conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party prior to the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order.
69.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further expressly and irrevocably waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles and releases, any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party may have or that may be derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the release contained in the preceding Paragraphs 66-68. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party expressly and irrevocably waives and releases any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party might otherwise have in relation to the release by virtue of the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or similar laws of any other state or jurisdiction. SECTION 1542 PROVIDES: "CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY GENERAL RELEASE. A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." In addition, although each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party may hereafter discover facts other than, different from, or in addition to those that it or he or she knows or believes to be true with respect to any claims released in the preceding Paragraphs 66-68, each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party hereby expressly waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles, discharges, and releases, any known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or non-contingent claims within the scope of the preceding Paragraphs 66-68, whether or not concealed or hidden, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such other,
 
different, or additional facts. Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall be deemed by operation of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Class Settlement Agreement.
70.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party covenants and agrees that it shall not, hereafter, seek to establish, or permit another to act for it in a representative capacity to seek to establish, liability against any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties based, in whole or in part, upon any conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-69 above.
71.    For purposes of clarity, it is specifically intended for the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-70 above to preclude all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class from seeking or obtaining any form of declaratory, injunctive, or equitable relief, or damages or other monetary relief relating to the period after the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order with respect to any Rule of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant, and the compliance by any Bank Defendant with any such Rule, as it is alleged to exist, now exists, may be modified in the manner provided in Paragraphs 40-45 and 53-57 above, or may in the future exist in the same or substantially similar form thereto.
72.    For avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Class Settlement Agreement releases any claim of a Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on:
(a)    breach of this Class Settlement Agreement;
(b)    standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty,
 
misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 66-71 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or any other Rule, fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-71 above;
(c)    the claims alleged in the currently operative complaints against the current defendants in (i) , No. 11-CV-02075-RJL (D.D.C.), and (ii) , No. 04-CV-02676-CRB (N.D. Cal) (including claims that have been asserted to have been alleged in the Second Amended or Third Amended Complaints against Bank of America, N.A.); or
NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
(d)    a claim seeking only injunctive relief against only the Visa Defendants regarding the legality of Visa's Fixed Acquirer Network Fee.
73.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further releases each of the Visa Defendants, MasterCard Defendants, and Bank Defendants and their counsel and experts in this Action from any claims relating to the defense of this Action, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement. Each Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Class Plaintiffs, other plaintiffs in the Class Actions, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions,
 
including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement.
74.    In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 below, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-73 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.
Preliminary Court Approval
75.    Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and Defendants agree to use reasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate the Court's preliminary approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, including filing necessary motion papers and scheduling any necessary hearings for a date and time that are convenient for the Court.
76.    Separately from any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, the Class Plaintiffs and Class Counsel agree to file with the Court a motion and supporting papers seeking preliminary approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, after providing Defendants with at least ten days advance notice of the contents of those papers, and to seek the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order in the form in Appendix D hereto, which will:
(a)    Preliminarily approve this Class Settlement Agreement as being within the range of a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and applicable law, and consistent with due process.
(b)    Approve the provisional certification of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class defined in Paragraph 2 above for settlement purposes only, and declare that in the event of termination of this Class Settlement Agreement, certification of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall
 
automatically be vacated and each Defendant may fully contest certification of any class as if no Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class had been certified.
(c)    Appoint as Class Counsel the law firms of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., Berger & Montague, P.C., and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.
(d)    Appoint as the Class Administrator to assist Class Counsel in effectuating and administering the Notice Plan and the exclusion process for Opt Outs, in analyzing and evaluating the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments and the Default Interchange Payments, and in effectuating and administering the claims process for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
            
(e)    Determine that notice should be provided to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, but that exclusion rights should be afforded only to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
(f)    Approve the method of notice to be provided to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and budget contained in Appendix E hereto, including use of the long-form website and mail notice and the publication notice contained in Appendix F hereto, and direct any further notice (and expenses therefor) that the Court may find necessary to provide due process.
(g)    Approve the procedures in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and below for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class to become Opt Outs and exclude themselves from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and including the provision of the information specified in Paragraph 84 below, and approve the procedures in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and below for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class to object to this Class Settlement Agreement.
 
(h)    Schedule a final approval hearing for a time and date convenient for the Court at least two hundred eighty five days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, at which hearing the Court will conduct an inquiry into the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of this Class Settlement Agreement and address any objections to it, and determine whether this Class Settlement Agreement and the Plan of Administration and Distribution should be finally approved, and whether to approve any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, and Class Plaintiffs' Awards.
(i)    Stay all further proceedings in this Action as between the Class Plaintiffs or any other plaintiff in a putative class action consolidated in MDL 1720, and the Defendants or any other defendant in a putative class action consolidated in MDL 1720, except for proceedings in MDL 1720 related to effectuating and complying with this Class Settlement Agreement, pending the Court's determination of whether this Class Settlement Agreement should be finally approved or the termination of this Class Settlement Agreement.
(j)    Enjoin the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, pending the Court's determination of whether this Class Settlement should finally be approved or the termination of this Class Settlement Agreement, from challenging in any action or proceeding any matter covered by this Class Settlement Agreement or its release and covenant not to sue provisions, except for (i) proceedings in MDL 1720 related to effectuating and complying with this Class Settlement Agreement, and (ii) any Opt Out's claims for damages based on any conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party prior to the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order.
77.    Prior to forty five days before the end of the Class Exclusion Period and Class Objection Period specified in Paragraphs 83 and 85 below, Class Counsel will file all motion and
 
supporting papers seeking the Court's final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, and any Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards with respect to any Class Action, so that notice of such motion or motions and any awards sought may be provided to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and to the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class under the Notice Plan.
78.    Within ten days after the filing with the Court of this Class Settlement Agreement and the accompanying motion papers seeking its preliminary approval, the Defendants shall cause notice of the Class Settlement Agreement to be served upon appropriate State and Federal officials as provided in the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C.  1715.
Class Settlement Notice and Exclusion Procedures
79.    Class Counsel and the Class Administrator shall carry out the settlement notice and exclusion procedures as ordered by the Court, and shall perform such related duties as may be necessary to provide those notice and exclusion procedures.
80.    As soon as practicable following the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, but before commencement of the mail and publication notice, the Class Administrator shall establish the dedicated Case Website, post office box, and toll-free telephone line for providing notice and information to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and receiving exclusion requests from members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, as provided in the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order and the Notice Plan contained in Appendices C and D hereto.

82.    Within ninety days following the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, the Class Administrator shall complete the mail and publication notice to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, using the long form mail notice and the publication notice contained in Appendix F hereto, as provided in the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order and the Notice Plan contained in Appendices D and E hereto, or as otherwise ordered by the Court.
83.    As explained in the long-form notice and publication notice contained in Appendix F hereto, any member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class that does not wish to participate in the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class shall have until one hundred eighty days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order  i.e., ninety days after the last date for completion of the mail and publication notice (the "Class Exclusion Period")  to submit a request to become an Opt Out and be excluded from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
 
84.    A member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class may effect such an exclusion by sending a written request to the Class Administrator, by first-class mail with postage prepaid and postmarked within the Class Exclusion Period.

(d)    The business names, brand names, and addresses of any stores or sales locations whose sales the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class member desires to be excluded from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
85.    As also explained in the long-form notice and publication notice contained in Appendix F hereto, any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class member that does not submit a request for exclusion, or any Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class member, shall have until one hundred eighty days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order  i.e., ninety days after the last date for completion of the mail and publication notice (the "Class Objection Period")  to submit an objection to this Class Settlement Agreement (be an "Objector") and any notice to appear.
86.    Such an Objector must file with the Court within the Class Objection Period and send to a designee of Class Counsel and a designee of counsel for the Defendants, by first-class mail and postmarked within the Class Objection Period, a written statement of objections. The
 
Objector's statement must: (a) contain the words "In re Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation"; (b) state each and every objection of the Objector and the specific reasons therefor; (c) provide all legal support and all evidence that the Objector wishes to bring to the Court's attention in support of any objection; (d) state the full name and address and telephone number of the Objector; (e) provide information sufficient to establish that the Objector is a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Member and/or a Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class member; and (f) state the full name, mail address, email address, and telephone number of any counsel representing the Objector in connection with the objections.
87.    In addition, any Objector or counsel for an Objector that desires to appear at the final approval hearing must file with the Court within the Class Objection Period, and send to a designee of Class Counsel and a designee of counsel for the Defendants by first class mail and postmarked within the Class Objection Period, a separate notice of intention to appear that identifies by name, position, address, and telephone number each person who intends to appear at the final approval hearing on behalf of the Objector.
88.    Upon receipt of any objection or notice of intention to appear, whether as provided in Paragraphs 86-87 above or otherwise, the designees of Class Counsel and counsel for the Defendants shall confer to ensure that they each receive a complete copy of all objections and any notice of intention to appear.
89.    Within one hundred ninety-five days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order  i.e., within fifteen days after the conclusion of the Class Exclusion Period  the Class Administrator shall prepare and file with the Court, and provide to a designee of Class Counsel, a designee of counsel for the Visa Defendants, a designee of counsel for the MasterCard Defendants, and a designee of counsel for the Bank Defendants, a report that:
 
(a)    Confirms that the Notice Plan was carried out and that the website notice, mail notice, publication notice, and any other notice to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class was provided in the manner directed by the Court.
(b)    Identifies the date when the Case Website was fully established and its content made available to the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, the date or dates on which mail notices were mailed, the dates of the publication notices, and the date or dates of any other notice directed by the Court.
(c)    Lists each member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class that sought to become an Opt Out and be excluded from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and on what date the request to be excluded was postmarked and received, and states whether the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class member's request for exclusion was timely and properly made.
(d)    Attaches a copy of all documentation concerning each request for exclusion that the Class Administrator received, with any taxpayer identification number, or other confidential information filed under seal with the Court.
90.    After receipt of the Class Administrator's report and its supporting documentation, the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments will be determined as follows:
(a)    Within fifteen days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with a report that calculates, based on the Opt Outs, the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments that should be made to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants pursuant to Paragraphs 17-20 above. The Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants also shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with the data used to make, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, those calculations. It is intended for the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to account fully for all the Opt Outs to the extent
 
possible, but Opt Out data that cannot be determined or estimated in any reasonable manner shall not be included for the purposes of calculating the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments under Paragraphs 18(a) or 19(a) above.
(b)    Class Counsel may, at its option, request that the Class Administrator provide, within fifteen days after receiving the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, an analysis and evaluation of the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, including all of its assumptions, data sources, and conclusions, and/or request that the Class Administrator prepare an independent report calculating the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments that should be made to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants.
(c)    In the event that within thirty days after receiving the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants  i.e., within approximately two hundred forty days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order  the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants have not resolved all differences regarding the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to be made to the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, they shall submit their dispute to the Court for resolution in connection with the final approval hearing, so that the Court's Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment may identify each Opt Out and state the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to be made, respectively, to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) as provided in Paragraphs 17-20 above.
91.    The Class Administrator's expenses for the foregoing notice and exclusion activities, including those of any third-party vendors it uses to perform tasks necessary for the implementation or effectuation of its duties, shall be paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s). In no event shall any Defendant, Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party, or
 
Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party have any obligation, responsibility, or liability with respect to the Class Administrator, the Notice Plan, or the exclusion procedures for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, including with respect to the costs, administration expenses, or any other charges for any notice and exclusion procedures.
92.    Class Counsel may, upon notice to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class in the manner approved by the Court, seek Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards. Class Counsel intend to apply for an Attorneys' Fee Award in an amount that is a reasonable percentage of the Total Cash Payment Amount and for Expense Awards comprising all reasonable expenses and costs incurred, which requested amounts will be disclosed in the mail, publication, and other notices provided to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class. Class Counsel reserve the right to make additional applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards for fees and expenses incurred after the Preliminary Approval Date, including for achieving the Settlement Final Approval Date and Settlement Final Date, and for the administration of this Class Settlement Agreement. Class Counsel shall allocate any Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards among counsel for the Class Plaintiffs and counsel for other plaintiffs in the Class Actions in a manner which they in good faith believe reflects the contribution of those counsel to the prosecution and settlement of the Class Actions in this Action.
93.    The Court may consider any applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards separately from a motion for preliminary or final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, and may enter orders regarding such applications separately from the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment. Any rehearing, reconsideration, vacation, review, appeal, or any other action taken regarding only a separate order concerning only an application for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and not in
 
any way concerning the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, shall not delay the Settlement Final Date that otherwise would occur with respect to the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
Final Court Approval
94.    Upon the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, the Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants agree to use reasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate the Court's final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, including filing the necessary motion papers and scheduling any necessary hearings for a date and time that are convenient for the Court.
95.    Separately from any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, the Class Plaintiffs agree to file with the Court a motion and supporting papers seeking final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, after providing Defendants with at least ten days advance notice of the contents of those papers, and to seek the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment in the form in Appendix G hereto, which will:
(a)      Determine that the Court has jurisdiction over the Class Plaintiffs, all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants, and jurisdiction to finally approve this Class Settlement Agreement.
(b)    Approve the notice and exclusion procedures provided to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and the notice procedures provided to the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, as fair, adequate, and sufficient, as the best practicable notice under the circumstances, and as reasonably calculated to apprise members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class of the Action, this Class Settlement Agreement, and their objection rights, and to apprise members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class of their exclusion
 
rights, and as fully satisfying the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, any other applicable laws or rules of the Court, and due process.
(c)    Finally approve this Class Settlement Agreement, including its consideration and release provisions, and find that the Class Settlement Agreement was made in good faith, following arm's-length negotiations, and was not collusive, and further find that the Class Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and consistent with the requirements of federal law and all applicable court rules, including Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.
(d)    Finally certify the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, both as defined in Paragraph 2 above, for settlement purposes only, and declare that in the event of termination of this Class Settlement Agreement, certification of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall automatically be vacated and each Defendant may fully contest certification of any class as if no Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class had been certified.
(e)    List all Opt Outs that timely and properly excluded themselves from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and state the agreed-upon or Court-resolved Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to be made, respectively, to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s).
(f)    Certify that the notification requirements of the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C.  1715, have been met.

(h)    Order that the Class Plaintiffs and Class Counsel shall provide to the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants such information as they may reasonably request, as needed in connection with litigation, regarding the claims made by, and payments made to, members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), which information may be produced subject to the terms of the protective order in this Action.
(i)    Incorporate all terms and conditions of this Class Settlement Agreement by reference, state the settlement consideration and full terms of the release and covenant not to sue of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, state the full terms of the release and covenant not to sue of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, provide that each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party unconditionally, fully, and finally releases and forever discharges each of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties from all released claims and waives any rights of Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class members to the protections afforded under California Civil Code  1542 and/or any other similar, comparable, or equivalent laws, and provide that each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party unconditionally, fully, and finally releases and forever discharges each of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties from all released claims and waives any rights of Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class members to the protections afforded under California Civil Code  1542 and/or any other similar, comparable, or equivalent laws.
(j)    Enjoin all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and those subject to their control, from commencing, maintaining, or participating in, or permitting another to commence, maintain, or participate in on its behalf, any claims released against Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties, and enjoin all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class from commencing, maintaining, or participating in, or permitting another to commence,
 
maintain, or participate on its behalf, any in any claims released against Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties.
(k)    Provide that the Court retains exclusive continuing jurisdiction in MDL 1720 over the Class Plaintiffs, the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants to implement, administer, consummate, and enforce this Class Settlement Agreement and the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, including any disputes relating to, or arising out of, the release and covenant not to sue of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or any claim for payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), and including any disputes relating to, or arising out of, the release and covenant not to sue of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class or any claim concerning any by-law, rule, operating regulation, practice, policy, or procedure of any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant.
(l)    Direct that, as to the Defendants, all putative class actions consolidated in MDL 1720, listed in Appendix A hereto, be dismissed with prejudice and without costs (except as provided for herein)
.
(m)    Determine that there is no just reason for delay in entering the final judgment, and direct that the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment shall be final and appealable.

96.    In the event that (a) any condition for the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date is not satisfied, (b) the Class Administrator fails to provide its report described in Paragraph 89 above by the date specified in Paragraph 89 or by such other date ordered by the Court, or (c) any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, Class Plaintiffs as a group or Defendants as a group may terminate this Class Settlement Agreement.
 
97.    Defendants as a group may terminate this Class Settlement Agreement by providing written notice to the other parties and the Court within ten business days after determining that the sum of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments calculated under Paragraphs 18 and 19 above, without regard to Paragraph 20 above, would exceed twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount.
98.    Class Plaintiffs as group or Defendants as a group, after conferring with the other group, may unilaterally terminate this Class Settlement Agreement by providing written notice to the other parties and the Court within twenty business days in the event that the Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, or the Court's Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment are materially modified or not fully affirmed on any appeal or otherwise, including but not limited to any modification of certification for the purposes of settlement of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class (from which exclusions are not permitted), and including but not limited to any modification of the releases and covenants not to sue provided by those settlement classes. Class Plaintiffs and Defendants agree to confer in good faith about whether to modify the twenty business day period provided in this Paragraph based on the circumstances.
99.    In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 above:
 (a)    two-thirds of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and already paid or incurred, shall promptly be paid to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, and one-third of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any Taxes due Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and already paid or incurred, shall promptly be paid to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate;

(e)    the terms and conditions of this Class Settlement Agreement, any publicly disseminated information regarding this Class Settlement Agreement, and any orders, motion filings, objections, or oral argument concerning this Class Settlement Agreement, including any motion papers with respect to motions for preliminary or final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, or for Attorneys' Fee Awards or Expense Awards or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, may not thereafter be used as evidence, and shall not be admissible as such, in the Action or any other civil action or other proceeding; and
(f)    with the exception of Paragraphs 6-8, 11, 91, 99(a)-(e) above and Paragraphs 108-110 below, this Class Settlement Agreement including all its releases and covenants not to sue shall be null and void, and of no force and effect, and the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants shall revert to their positions before the execution of this Class Settlement
 
Agreement, including with respect to the appropriateness of class certification, as if this Class Settlement Agreement had not been reached or executed.
Continuing Jurisdiction
100.    The Court will retain continuing jurisdiction over the Class Plaintiffs, the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants to implement, administer, consummate, and enforce this Class Settlement Agreement and the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
101.    The Defendants and the Class Plaintiffs agree, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class will be deemed to have agreed, to submit irrevocably to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for the resolution of any matter covered by this Class Settlement Agreement, the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, or the applicability of this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
102.    All applications to the Court with respect to any aspect of this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment shall be presented to and be determined by United States District Judge John Gleeson for resolution as a matter within the scope of MDL 1720, or, if he is not available, any other District Court Judge designated by the Court. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby agreed that any suit, action, proceeding, or dispute of a Class Plaintiff or member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, in which the provisions of this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment are asserted as a ground for a defense, in whole or in part, to any claim or cause of action, or are otherwise raised as an objection, constitutes a suit, action, proceeding, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
 
103.    In the event that the provisions of this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment are asserted by any Defendant or Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party as a ground for a defense, in whole or in part, to any claim or cause of action, or are otherwise raised as an objection in any other suit, action, or proceeding by a Class Plaintiff or member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, it is hereby agreed that the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties shall be entitled to an immediate stay of that suit, action, or proceeding until after the Court has entered an order or judgment determining any issues relating to the defense or objections based on such provisions, and no further judicial review of such order or judgment is possible.
Additional Terms and Conditions
104.    Without expanding or limiting the release it provides herein, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party shall be deemed to have agreed that this Class Settlement Agreement fully addresses and redresses any and all antitrust or other competitive issues presented by the Visa Defendants' and the MasterCard Defendants' respective payment networks in the United States, and the Bank Defendants' participation in those respective payment networks, including any reorganization, restructuring, initial or other public offering, or other corporate structuring of any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant.
105.    The Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, Defendants, and counsel for the Defendants, agree that they:
 (a)    Shall not in any way encourage, promote, or solicit any person, business, or entity within the definition of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, or their counsel, to request exclusion from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, to object to this Class Settlement Agreement, or to seek any relief inconsistent with this Class Settlement Agreement.
 
 (b)    Shall not in any way encourage, promote, or solicit any person, business, or entity within the definition of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, or their counsel, to object to this Class Settlement Agreement or to seek any relief inconsistent with this Class Settlement Agreement.
 (c)    Shall not in any way encourage, promote, or solicit any person, business, or entity within the definition of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, or their counsel, to facilitate, induce, or cause the non-fulfillment of a condition, or the occurrence of an event, that could result in the termination of this Class Settlement Agreement.
106.    The Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants shall undertake reasonable efforts to timely obtain any required approvals or consents to execute and proceed with this Class Settlement Agreement.
107.    The Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants shall execute all documents and perform any additional acts reasonably necessary and proper to effectuate the terms of this Class Settlement Agreement.
108.    The terms and provisions of the Fourth Amended Protective Order, filed on October 29, 2009, and approved by the Court on October 30, 2009, shall survive and continue in effect through and after any final adjudication of the Class Actions.
109.    Each of the Defendants specifically denies any and all liability in this Action. It is expressly understood and agreed that, by entering into this Class Settlement Agreement, each Defendant, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party, and each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party is not admitting any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever to the Class Plaintiffs, any member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, any member of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, or any other person or entity, and is not admitting the truth of any
 
allegations or circumstances, nor is any Defendant, Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party, or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party waiving any defense.
110.    This Class Settlement Agreement, and all negotiations, documents, and discussions associated with it, shall be without prejudice to the rights, positions, or privileges of any Class Plaintiff or Defendant or other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party (except as expressly provided for in this Class Settlement Agreement), and shall not be construed as, or deemed to be, an admission or evidence on the part of any Defendant or other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party of any violation of any statute, regulation, law, rule, or principle of common law or equity, or of any liability or wrongdoing, or of the truth or merit of any allegations or claims in this Action, and shall not be discoverable, used, offered, or accepted, directly or indirectly, as evidence of such in this Action or any other action, litigation, arbitration, or other proceeding, and shall have no precedential value; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall preclude use of this Class Settlement Agreement in any proceeding to enforce this Class Settlement Agreement or the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
111.    Nothing in this Class Settlement Agreement is intended to waive any right to assert that any information or material is protected from discovery by reason of any individual or common interest privilege, attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or other privilege, protection, or immunity, or is intended to waive any right to contest any such claim of privilege, protection, or immunity.
112.    This Class Settlement Agreement constitutes the entire, complete, and integrated agreement between and among the Class Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants with
 
respect to the settlement of the Class Actions. All of the Appendices to this Class Settlement Agreement are material and integral parts of it and are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
113.    The terms of this Class Settlement Agreement are not severable, but are interdependent and have been agreed to only as a whole by the Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants.
114.    This Class Settlement Agreement supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements, and is not subject to any condition not provided for in this Class Settlement Agreement. In entering into and executing this Class Settlement Agreement, the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants warrant that they are acting upon their respective independent judgments and upon the advice of their respective counsel, and not in reliance upon any warranty or representation, express or implied, of any nature or kind by any other person or entity, other than the warranties and representations expressly made in this Class Settlement Agreement.
115.    This Class Settlement Agreement shall be governed, construed, enforced, and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict of laws principles.

This Class Settlement Agreement may not be modified or amended except (a) by a writing signed by the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants or their respective counsel and approved by the Court, or (b) by motion to the Court by a Class Plaintiff or Defendant based on changed circumstances that would make continued application of Paragraphs 42 or 55 above inequitable.
117.    This Class Settlement Agreement or any portion thereof shall not be construed more strictly against any party to it merely because it may have been prepared by counsel for one of them, it being recognized that because of the arm's-length negotiations resulting in this Class
 
Settlement Agreement, all parties to this Class Settlement Agreement have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of it.
118.    All headings used in this Class Settlement Agreement are for reference and convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Class Settlement Agreement.
119.    The waiver by any Class Plaintiff or Defendant of any breach of this Class Settlement Agreement shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of any other breach of this Class Settlement Agreement, whether prior, subsequent, or contemporaneous.
120.    This Class Settlement Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Class Plaintiffs, the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants. The Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties other than the Defendants are third party beneficiaries of this Class Settlement Agreement and are authorized to enforce the provisions of this Class Settlement Agreement, including without limitation the release and covenant not to sue provisions in Paragraphs 31-38 and Paragraphs 66-74 above, the continuing jurisdiction provisions in Paragraphs 100-103 above, and such other provisions of this Class Plaintiffs' Settlement Agreement as are applicable to them.
121.    Any notice or materials to be provided to the Class Plaintiffs pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement shall be sent to Class Counsel, and any notice or materials to be provided to the Defendants pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement shall be sent to their respective counsel in MDL 1720, whose names and contact information are set forth in Appendix H hereto. Any notice or materials to be submitted to the Court pursuant to this Class Settlement Agreement shall also be filed in MDL 1720 through the Electronic Court Filing (ECF) system of the Court.
 
122.    Each of the undersigned representatives of each Class Plaintiff and each Defendant represents that it is fully authorized to enter into, and to execute, this Class Settlement Agreement on behalf of that Class Plaintiff or Defendant. Each of the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agrees that, in return for the agreements in this Class Settlement Agreement, it is receiving good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency whereof is hereby acknowledged.
123.    This Class Settlement Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The Class Settlement Agreement shall become effective only when executed by all of the Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants, and approved by the requisite vote of the members of Visa U.S.A. Inc. entitled to vote thereon.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the signatories below have read and understood this Class Settlement Agreement, have executed it, represent that the undersigned are authorized to execute this Class Settlement Agreement on behalf of their respectively represented parties, have agreed to be bound by its terms, and have duly executed this Class Settlement Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) has agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation. The MOU has been executed by all of the defendants  which include MasterCard, Visa and a number of banks  and the court-appointed class counsel for the merchants. Separately, MasterCard has reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims brought by the individual merchant plaintiffs.
Purchase, N.Y.,  July 13, 2012
After execution of both settlement agreements and upon final approval of the class settlement by the court, MasterCard will have resolved all pending U.S. merchant litigations concerning the company's interchange structure and merchant acceptance rules.
"Our decision to settle is based on our belief that MasterCard and our stakeholders are best served by an amicable resolution," said Noah Hanft, MasterCard's General Counsel and Chief Franchise Integrity Officer. "Although we have strong defenses to all claims, a settlement avoids years of litigation and uncertainties that are inherent in such cases. We believe that today's settlements should resolve all issues with the merchant community."
MasterCard's share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790 million on a pre-tax basis. As a result, the company will incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its second quarter 2012 financial statements. MasterCard had previously recorded a $770 million charge in its fourth quarter 2011 financial statements.
U.S. merchant class members will receive a 10 basis points reduction in credit interchange rates for eight months, which will be implemented by MasterCard withholding this amount from U.S. issuers. In addition, the settlement agreement requires that MasterCard negotiate in good faith with any lawful merchant buying group in an effort to reach a commercially reasonable agreement.
MasterCard will also be required to make modifications to its No Surcharge Rule to allow U.S. merchants the ability to impose checkout fees on credit cards, subject to certain conditions that are intended to protect cardholders. Merchants have agreed to provide consumers with disclosures and limit the level and circumstances in which they may impose checkout fees on a cardholder which are designed to avoid unfair, unexpected or exorbitant fees.
There are also provisions in the settlement that prevent MasterCard cardholders from being unfairly targeted with checkout fees relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as American Express, Discover and PayPal, should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging. State laws that may limit or prohibit surcharging are not impacted by this agreement.
MasterCard Enters into Agreement to Settle U.S. Merchant Litigations, Page 2
 
"We know that merchants care about their customers and anticipate that they will not impose checkout fees, particularly because the value merchants derive from card acceptance far exceeds their costs," said Hanft. "However, throughout the litigation and as a condition for resolution, the merchant plaintiffs sought a change to the current rule and we focused our efforts in settlement negotiations to ensure consumer safeguards were included."
The settlements will provide MasterCard and its customer financial institutions with a broad release of all claims that were alleged, or could have been alleged by the merchants concerning MasterCard's interchange structure and merchant acceptance rules, as well as the future effect of MasterCard's existing rules and practices. In agreeing to the settlement, MasterCard in no way admits to any improper conduct with respect to the plaintiffs' allegations. All business and rule practice changes will occur after preliminary approval of the settlement, most likely in late 2012 or early 2013.
The merchant litigations and the impact to MasterCard are described in more detail in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2011.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012. Excluding a special item, the company reported net income of $713 million, up 17%, and earnings per diluted share of $5.65, up 19%, in each case versus the year-ago period. Including the special item, an incremental $13 million after-tax charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations, the company reported net income of $700 million, or $5.55 per diluted share. The company's total operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share, excluding the special item, are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, August 1, 2012
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.8 billion, a 9% increase versus the same period in 2011. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 13% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 13% on a local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2011, to $661 billion. As of June 30, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"Though economic uncertainties continued to persist, we experienced solid volume and processed transaction growth in all regions as we are focused on driving our global business to expand the reach of electronic payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "We are executing on strategic partnerships as demonstrated by our recent announcement with Deutsche Telekom and the completion of AliPay's integration with the DataCash payment platform, which will expand AliPay's reach to online retailers outside of China. We also continue to work with government entities around the world, like the South African Social Security Agency, to help them implement more efficient and secure ways to deliver social benefits and to increase transparency and financial inclusion."
 
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
Based on the company's decision to enter into settlement agreements in the U.S. merchant litigations, the company recorded a $20 million pre-tax charge, or $13 million on an after-tax basis, in the second quarter of 2012. This special item is incremental to the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reflect the company's total financial portion of $790 million in the settlement of these cases.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 6%, to $826 million in the second quarter of 2012. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses increased 9%. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives. Including the special item, total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2012 increased 8% versus the year-ago period, to $846 million.
Excluding the special item, operating income for the second quarter of 2012 increased 12% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 54.6%.
MasterCard reported other expense of $1 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus other income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change was primarily driven by increased expenses from investments in joint ventures.
Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 28.0% in the second quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 31.8% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to discrete benefits relating to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions. A more favorable geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the decrease.
During the second quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $671 million. Quarter-to-date through July 26, the company repurchased an additional 132,250 shares at a cost of approximately $57 million, with $1.4 billion remaining under the most recent $1.5 billion repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2012 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, MasterCard reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $11.01 per diluted share, excluding the special item from the second quarter of 2012. Including the special item, diluted earnings per share was $10.91.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 13% versus the same period in 2011, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Gross dollar volume growth of 17%, transaction processing growth of 29% and cross-border volume growth of 18% contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.

Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 9%, to $1.6 billion, for the six months ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives.

MasterCard's effective tax rate was 30.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2012, including and excluding the special item, versus a rate of 32.3% in the comparable period in 2011.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Martina Hund-Mejean, Chief Financial Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A common stock") for personal financial management purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of approximately 3,600 shares of Class A common stock associated with restricted stock unit awards. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to specified limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as October 8, 2012 and will end no later than December 31, 2012. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Ms. Hund-Mejean will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby she is encouraged to hold at least four times her base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A common stock held directly or indirectly by Ms. Hund-Mejean are included; however, restricted stock units, performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.

On September 20, 2012, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") will host a meeting for members of the investment community. As part of discussions at the meeting, the Company is providing the following 2013-2015 longer-term performance objectives (on a constant currency basis and excluding future acquisitions):
 
At the meeting, the Company will provide additional context with respect to the above performance objectives, including its expectations around the currently weak global economic environment. The Company also assumes that there will not be any further deterioration in the U.S. economy or more significant problems within the Eurozone. Based on these expectations, the Company expects that net revenue growth in the early part of the 2013-2015 period may be slightly below the 11-14% range and, in later years, net revenue growth could be at the higher end of this range, assuming that the global economy could return to a more stable environment.
Presentation materials for the meeting are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The descriptions of longer-term performance objectives set forth above and all information set forth in the attached presentation materials is furnished but not filed.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 19, 2012, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Registrant") and its operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International" and, together with the Registrant, "MasterCard") entered into a definitive Class Settlement Agreement (the "Class Settlement Agreement") with Visa, Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association; the merchant class plaintiffs and customer banks to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in the case captioned MDL 1720. The Class Settlement Agreement is subject to court approval.
The Class Settlement Agreement is substantially identical to the form of class settlement agreement attached to a Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") entered into by the parties on July 13, 2012, with an addition of certain appendices (as contemplated by the MOU). The MOU (including the form of class settlement agreement) was filed by the Registrant as an exhibit to, and described in, the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Registrant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 16, 2012 (the "July 8-K").
Item 8.01 Other Events
Separately, on October 19, 2012, MasterCard also executed a settlement agreement (consistent with the agreement-in-principle disclosed in the July 8-K) to settle all claims brought by the individual merchant plaintiffs in the above-referenced U.S. merchant litigations.
As previously disclosed, MasterCard's financial portion of both the merchant class and individual plaintiff settlements is estimated to total $790 million on a pre-tax basis. MasterCard recorded a pre-tax charge of $770 million in the fourth quarter 2011 and an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in the second quarter of 2012 with respect to this settlement.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012. The company reported net income of $772 million, up 8%, and earnings per diluted share of $6.17, up 10%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, October 31, 2012
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $1.9 billion, a 5% increase versus the same period in 2011. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 10% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 12% on a local currency basis versus the third quarter of 2011, to $676 billion. As of September 30, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"MasterCard continues to drive solid financial performance and focus on executing key deals, investments and partnerships," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "We won significant business in Europe this quarter with Nordea, Credit Agricole and CSOB in the Czech Republic and, in the U.S., we acquired loyalty reward provider Truaxis to better connect consumers with targeted, relevant offers.
"Additionally, emerging geographies and governments continue to provide great opportunities for growth. In Africa, our win with Nakumatt, the largest supermarket chain in East Africa, is expected to deliver more than a million multi-currency prepaid loyalty cards to consumers. We also continue to support governments around the world, including new programs in the U.S. and Mexico with several large government agencies that help save money and deliver more effective and efficient programs and benefits," Banga concluded.

Total operating expenses increased 5%, to $854 million in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted for currency, operating expenses increased 8%. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2012 increased 6% over the year-ago period, and the company delivered an operating margin of 55.5%.
MasterCard reported other income of $2 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus other income of $28 million in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions in last year's third quarter and increased expenses from investments in joint ventures.
The effective tax rate was 27.6% in the third quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 30.5% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete benefit related to additional export incentives and a benefit from a deduction related to the Company's authorization software.
During the third quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased approximately 500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $216 million. Quarter-to-date through October 25, the company repurchased approximately 255,000 additional shares at a cost of approximately $119 million, with $1.1 billion remaining under the most recent $1.5 billion repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2012 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, MasterCard reported net income of $2.2 billion, or $17.18 per diluted share, excluding a special item taken in the second quarter for an incremental $13 million after-tax charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations. Including the special item, diluted earnings per share was $17.07.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 10% versus the same period in 2011, or 14% adjusted for currency. Gross dollar volume growth of 16%, transaction processing growth of 27% and cross-border volume growth of 16% contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Excluding the special item, operating expenses increased 8%, to $2.4 billion, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives. Excluding currency fluctuations and the special item, total operating expenses increased 10%. Including the special item in the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 9%.
Excluding the special item, operating income increased 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 versus the same period in 2011, delivering an operating margin of 55.6%.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 3
 
MasterCard reported no other income/expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, versus other income of $35 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower realized gains on sales of investments, increased expenses from investments in joint ventures and an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions made in last year's third quarter.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 29.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, including the special item, compared to a rate of 31.6% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Accordingly, except for the company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forward-looking information to reflect actual results of operations, changes in financial condition, changes in estimates, expectations or assumptions, changes in general economic or industry conditions or other circumstances arising and/or existing since the preparation of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
In 2012, certain MasterCard Debit and Credit Programs in the Europe region have changed due to a reclassification of programs. There is no impact at the All MasterCard Programs level. In addition, Purchase Transactions for certain Credit Programs in the Latin America region have been restated due to revisions from several customers. MasterCard revenue is not impacted from these changes. Data for the comparable periods in 2012, 2011 and 2010 have been restated to be consistent with these approaches.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

The Managing Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a London Interbank Offered Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Managing Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
Computation of Interest and Fees
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Managing Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Managing Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Managing Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.14(a) or 2.7(b).
2.16 . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
(a) the Managing Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(b) the Managing Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the London Interbank Offered Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
the Managing Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, and during such period until such circumstances described in paragraph (a) and (b) above cease to exist, (x) any LIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans, shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Managing Administrative Agent (it being understood that the Managing Administrative Agent shall promptly withdraw any such notice if the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above cease to exist) no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Loans, as the case may be.
2.17 . (a) Except as provided in Section 2.23(d), each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any facility fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on any Loans (other than any CAF Advance) shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Managing Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Managing Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Managing Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the relevant Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
(b) Unless the Managing Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its allocable share of such borrowing available to the Managing Administrative Agent, the Managing Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Managing Administrative Agent, and the Managing Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Managing Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Managing Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Managing
 
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Managing Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to the Managing Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Managing Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower. If any such Lender shall subsequently pay its Commitment Percentage of such borrowing with interest thereon to the Managing Administrative Agent, the Managing Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
2.18 .

If the aggregate amount of all Swing Line Commitments is at any time less than $1,400,000,000 (such shortfall, the ""), the Borrower may designate one or more of the other existing Lenders as Swing Line Lenders (it being understood that the Swing Line Commitments of any such Lender may, at the option of such Lender, exceed its Commitment), having Swing Line Commitments in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Swing Line Commitment Shortfall; that no Lender may be so designated unless it agrees in its sole discretion to act in such capacity. The Swing Line Commitment of each Swing Line Lender (unless otherwise agreed by such Swing Line Lender) shall be reduced as follows: (x) upon any reduction of the Commitment of any Lender that is also a Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4, the Swing Line Commitment of such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by the same proportion as such Commitment is so reduced and (y) upon any assignment by such Swing Line Lender of all or any portion of its Swing Line Commitment pursuant to subsection 9.6(c) and the assumption by the relevant assignee of the amount of such Swing Line Commitment so assigned, the Swing Line Commitment of such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by the amount of its Swing Line Commitment so assigned. During the Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swing Line Commitment by borrowing, prepaying the Swing Line Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. All Swing Line Loans shall bear interest based upon the ABR and shall not be entitled to be converted into loans that bear interest at any other rate. The Borrower shall give the relevant Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Managing Administration Agent) irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date specifying the amount of the requested Swing Line Loan which shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof).

Each Swing Line Lender is hereby authorized to record the Borrowing Date, the amount of each Swing Line Loan made by such Swing Line Lender and the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereof, on the schedule annexed to and constituting a part of the Swing Line Note of such Swing Line Lender and any such recordation shall constitute evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded, that the failure by such Swing Line Lender to make any such recordation shall not affect any of the obligations of the Borrower under such Swing Line Note or this Agreement. Each Swing Line Note shall (a) be dated the Closing Date, (b) be stated to mature on the Revolving Credit Termination Date and (c) bear interest for the period from the date thereof until paid in full on the unpaid principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding at the applicable interest rate per annum determined as provided in, and payable as specified in, Section 2.14.

In connection with this opinion, I have examined an executed copy of the Agreement, and such corporate documents and records of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and officers of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and such other documents, as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures of, and the authority of, Persons signing the Agreement on behalf of parties thereto other than the Borrower, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
i. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation (provided that no opinion is given under this clause (a) with respect to any Subsidiary that is not a Material Subsidiary of the Borrower if the failure of such Subsidiary to be duly organized, validly existing or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect), (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good standing
under the laws of each jurisdiction (other than that of its organization) where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except in the case of (b) or (c), to the extent that the failure to have such power, authority and legal right or to qualify as a foreign entity or to be in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
ii. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Agreement are within the corporate powers of the Borrower, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no governmental approval, and do not contravene any law or regulation applicable to, including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the Board, or any contractual restriction binding on, the Borrower.
iii. The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance or validity of the Agreement other than those expressly required by the terms of the Agreement.
iv. To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, except to the extent set forth in Schedule 3.6 attached to the Agreement or as previously disclosed in any public filings made by the Borrower, there are no pending or threatened actions or proceedings affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely to the Borrower or such Subsidiary, could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
v. The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York and express no opinion on any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Managing Administrative Agent
Credit Agreement
Borrower
Lenders
Administrative Agent
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.1(g)(ii) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied on an executed counterpart of the Credit Agreement and we have made such investigations of law as we have deemed appropriate for purposes of this opinion.
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with respect to the Credit Agreement, that:
(i) the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized by, has been duly executed and delivered by, and (except to the extent set forth in the opinions below as to the Borrower) constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto;
(ii) all signatories to the Credit Agreement have been duly authorized;
(iii) all of the parties to the Credit Agreement are duly organized and validly existing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as the enforceability thereof is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(A) The enforceability of Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from or requiring indemnification of a party for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012. The company reported net income of $605 million, up 18%, and earnings per diluted share of $4.86, up 21%, in each case versus the year-ago period, excluding a special item representing a charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. These net income and earnings per diluted share growth figures are reconciled to their comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
Purchase, NY, January 31, 2013
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.9 billion, a 10% increase versus the same period in 2011. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 12%. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 13% on a local currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011, to $727 billion. As of December 31, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our fourth-quarter results, which saw double-digit growth in net revenue, cross-border volume and processed transactions," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "We are gaining traction in our U.S. credit business with some recent wins, continuing to experience momentum in our mobile initiatives around the world, and securing important business in emerging markets like Africa and Brazil."
Total operating expenses increased 3%, to $996 million, during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, excluding the special item. Adjusted for currency, operating expenses increased 4%. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees in support of strategic growth initiatives and the net impact of foreign exchange activity, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing expenses. Including the special item from 2011, total operating expenses decreased 43% from the year-ago period.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 18% over the year-ago period, excluding the special item, and the company delivered an operating margin of 47.4%.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 32.3% in the comparable period in 2011, excluding the special item.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased 1.3 million shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $613 million. Quarter-to-date through January 25, the company repurchased an additional 322,000 shares at a cost of approximately $165 million, with $440 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.
Full-Year 2012 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2012, MasterCard reported net income of $2.8 billion, up 15%, and earnings per diluted share of $22.04, up 18%, in each case versus the year-ago period and excluding special items in both 2011 and 2012. The special item in 2012 was an incremental charge taken in the second quarter related to the U.S. merchant litigations. Including this special item, full-year 2012 net income remained $2.8 billion and earnings per diluted share was $21.94.
Net revenue for full-year 2012 was $7.4 billion, an increase of 10% versus 2011. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 13%. Processed transaction growth of 25%, gross dollar volume growth of 15% and cross-border volume growth of 16% contributed to the net revenue growth in the full-year period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Excluding special items in both years, total operating expenses increased 6%, to $3.4 billion, for 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives and partially offset by lower advertising and marketing expenses. Adjusted for currency, total operating expenses increased 8%. Including special items, total operating expenses in 2012 decreased 14%, to $3.5 billion, versus 2011.
Excluding special items, operating income increased 14% for 2012 versus 2011, delivering an operating margin of 53.5% for full-year 2012.
Total other expense was $5 million for full-year 2012 versus total other income of $33 million in 2011. This was primarily driven by lower investment income, increased expenses from investments in joint ventures and the non-recurrence of an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions made last year.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 29.9% for full-year 2012, versus a rate of 31.8% for full-year 2011, excluding the special item in 2011. Including this special item, the effective tax rate was 30.6% for full-year 2011. The decrease in the 2012 effective tax rate was primarily due to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions, as well as a benefit from a deduction related to the company's authorization software.
For full-year 2012, MasterCard repurchased 4.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.7 billion.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Accordingly, except for the company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forward-looking information to reflect actual results of operations, changes in financial condition, changes in estimates, expectations or assumptions, changes in general economic or industry conditions or other circumstances arising and/or existing since the preparation of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
In 2012, certain MasterCard Debit and Credit Programs in the Europe region have changed due to a reclassification of programs. There is no impact at the All MasterCard Programs level. In addition, Purchase Transactions for certain Credit Programs in the Latin America region have been revised due to changes from several customers. MasterCard revenue is not impacted from these changes. Data for the comparable periods in 2012, 2011 and 2010 have been revised to be consistent with these approaches. For 2012Q4, U.S. acceptance locations reflect an increase, primarily due to customer revisions.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Ajay Banga, President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A common stock"), for personal financial management purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of: (1) 1,500 shares of Class A common stock associated with vested performance stock unit awards and (2) 29,564 shares of Class A common stock underlying vested stock option awards. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to certain limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as May 6, 2013 and will end no later than January 15, 2014. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Mr. Banga will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby he is encouraged to hold at least six times his base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A common stock held directly or indirectly by Mr. Banga are included; however, not yet vested restricted stock units or performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On February 25, 2013, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the year ending December 31, 2013 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and the other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on April 24, 2012) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP").

The Compensation Committee may decide to reduce the total amount awarded under the SEAICP at its discretion.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 1, 2013, MasterCard Incorporated ("MasterCard") issued a press release announcing financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
In the attached press release, MasterCard presents growth rates adjusted for currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Due to the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on reported results, MasterCard's management believes the presentation of certain growth rates adjusted for currency, calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates, provides relevant information. MasterCard's management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 1, 2013, MasterCard will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter ended March 31, 2013 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2013. The company reported net income of $766 million, up 12%, and earnings per diluted share of $6.23, up 16%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, May 1, 2013
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2013 was $1.9 billion, an 8% increase versus the same period in 2012. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 9%. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to increased volumes and new and renewed agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 10% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2012, to $690 billion. As of March 31, 2013, the company's customers had issued 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our first-quarter results as we delivered solid performance that met our expectations despite the mixed global economic environment," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "Since the start of the year, we have had steady momentum in new business, as well as product innovations. We signed new consumer credit agreements with Bank of America and TD Bank and secured significant wins in our APMEA region with Qantas, South Africa's NedBank, and Japan's Rakuten. We also signed an alliance with the Alibaba Group to explore opportunities in the Chinese market. In addition, we advanced our mobile and digital strategy with the commercial launch of MasterPass."
Total operating expenses increased 6%, to $799 million, during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2013 increased 11% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 58.1%.
MasterCard Incorporated  Page 2
 
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 30.5% in the first quarter of 2013, versus a rate of 31.8% in the comparable period in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and a benefit from a deduction related to the company's authorization software.
During the first quarter of 2013, MasterCard repurchased approximately 1,480,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $766 million. Quarter-to-date through April 25, the company repurchased an additional 341,500 shares at a cost of approximately $182 million, with $1.7 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.

At 9:00 a.m. ET today, the company will host a conference call to discuss its first-quarter financial results. The dial-in information for this call is 888-771-4371 (within the U.S.) and 847-585-4405 (outside the U.S.), and the passcode is 34404423.

The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
In 2012, certain MasterCard Debit and Credit Programs in the Europe region have changed due to a reclassification of programs. There is no impact at the All MasterCard Programs level. In addition, Purchase Transactions for certain Credit Programs in the Latin America region have been revised due to changes from several customers. MasterCard revenue is not impacted from these changes. Data for the comparable periods in 2012, 2011 and 2010 have been revised to be consistent with these approaches.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.

MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Martina Hund-Mejean, Chief Financial Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A common stock"), for personal financial management purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of 8,868 shares of Class A common stock underlying vested stock option awards. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to certain limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as August 5, 2013 and will end no later than April 15, 2014. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Ms. Hund-Mejean will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby she is encouraged to hold at least four times her base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A common stock held directly or indirectly by Ms. Hund-Mejean are included; however, not yet vested restricted stock units or performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
