INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Description 99.1 Press Release issued by KLA-Tencor Corporation dated April 23, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Posts $27 Million in Net Income for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2003 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2003--KLA-Tencor Corp. (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its third quarter of fiscal 2003, ended March 31, 2003. For the three-month period, the company posted net income of $27 million or $0.14 per share on revenue of $304 million versus $34 million or $0.17 per share on revenues of $357 million for the same period last year. When compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased 9% from $335 million while net income decreased 6% from $29 million. For the nine-month period, the company posted net income of $108 million or $0.56 per share on revenues of $1.01 billion compared to earnings of $170 million or $0.86 per share and $1.26 billion in revenue in the first nine months of the previous fiscal year. According to Chief Executive Officer Ken Schroeder, the value KLA-Tencor brings to its customers and the company's operational excellence are reflected in the quarter's performance. "We're pleased to report that the book to ship ratio exceeded 1:1 for the first time in three quarters. Our net margin of 9% also improved quarter over quarter, despite a very tough environment. In addition, our cost reduction programs from previous periods and completion of some key engineering programs resulted in an 11% reduction in operating expenses quarter over quarter -- saving the company an additional $15 million." Schroeder added that KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from the technological leadership of its broad product portfolio, especially as customers become increasingly value oriented in allocating their capital dollars. "We continue to introduce breakthrough solutions -- such as our eCD 1 CD SEM and Archer Aim overlay tools introduced this quarter -- which deliver unparalleled capabilities for successful pattern transfer down to the 65 nm node. We believe the accelerated adoption of our new products demonstrates the strong customer confidence in our technology leadership as well the overall strength and reputation of KLA-Tencor." From a regional perspective, bookings during the quarter showed the largest percentage improvement in Taiwan and China. The U.S. and Japan remained steady with booking levels consistent with the previous quarter while Korea and Europe returned to a more normal percentage of total booking following a strong second quarter. The company ended the quarter with approximately six months of shipment backlog at current shipping levels. By quarter end, the company had increased total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $89 million to a total of $1.4 billion with no long-term debt on the balance sheet. Inventory decreased $21 million to $269 million. Accounts receivable decreased by $26 million on lower shipments while DSO on shipments remained at 68 days. Gross margin of 48.5 percent decreased slightly from 48.9 percent in the previous quarter due primarily to a higher percentage of service revenue. Forward Looking Statements: Statements in this press release regarding technological leadership, market share and adoption, current order backlog and future cost-saving measures are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: delays or cancellations of orders by customers; shipments or acceptances; inability by the company to meet its production and/or product development schedules; the demand for semiconductors; and new and enhanced product offerings by competitors. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those projected, please refer to the company's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in the risk factors described in the company's SEC filings.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Description ------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by KLA-Tencor Corporation dated July 24, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Reports $137 Million in Net Income on Revenue of $1.32 Billion for Fiscal Year 2003; Net Income and Earnings Up On Quarter-Over-Quarter Basis SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 24, 2003--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and 2003 fiscal year. For the quarter ending June 30, 2003, the company reported improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Net income of $29 million and earnings per share of $0.15 in the June 2003 fiscal quarter were a 7 percent improvement over net income of $27 million and earnings per share of $0.14 posted in the March quarter. Revenue of $308 million in the June quarter was up slightly from revenue of $304 million in the March quarter. The June 2003 quarter results compare to net income of $47 million and earnings per share of $0.23 on revenues of $373 million for the same period last year. For the full 2003 fiscal year, KLA-Tencor reported net income of $137 million and earnings per share of $0.70 on revenue of $1.32 billion compared, to fiscal year 2002 net income of $216 million and earnings per share of $1.10 on revenues of $1.64 billion. Ken Schroeder, Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor, stated that while the company continues to streamline its operations to increase profitability, it is taking equal care to preserve its ability to capitalize on an industry upturn. "Although the increase in business activity is not broad based, we are definitely seeing a number of our customers reporting an upturn in their business," Schroeder observed. "As the recovery occurs, we believe that the twin forces of rising demand for leading-edge chips and an under-investment in leading-edge capacity will contribute to stronger sales for semiconductor process control equipment. During the year, KLA-Tencor worked closely with semiconductor manufacturers to overcome the yield challenges of next-generation processes, including copper interconnects, sub-130-nm design rules and 300-mm wafers. We are now well positioned to benefit from future industry growth with solutions that have proven critical to ramping and sustaining yields of next-generation chips." KLA-Tencor reported that it ended the year with approximately six months of backlog at current shipping levels. Geographically, during the quarter, the strongest order activity originated from Japan which was above its historical share. China and Singapore were also above historical levels while the United States, Europe, Taiwan and Korea fell below historical levels during the quarter. Gross margins improved from 48.5 percent in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 to 49.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Cost reductions in service and manufacturing expenses contributed to the improvement in gross margins. Operating expenses were unchanged at $122 million; a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense offset a $3 million increase in engineering expense. The company increased total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $90 million to $1.49 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Inventory and accounts receivables decreased during the quarter. Inventory was reduced by $10 million to $259 million, and accounts receivable were lowered by $8 million to $224 million. Forward Looking Statements: Statements in this press release regarding the company's positioning for future industry growth, potential economic recovery, upturn in customer business, current order backlog, rising demand for semiconductor process control equipment and cost-saving measures are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Description - ------- -------------- 99.1 Press Release issued by KLA-Tencor Corporation dated October 22, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99.1 KLA-Tencor Posts $37 Million in Net Income on Revenue of $318 Million for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2004 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2003--KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal 2004, ended September 30, 2003. The company recorded net income of $37 million and earnings per share of $0.18 on revenue of $318 million in the September quarter, each of which reflect a sequential quarter-to-quarter improvement over net income of $29 million, earnings per share of $0.15 and revenue of $308 million in the June quarter. For the first quarter of last fiscal year, the company earned net income of $51 million and earnings per share of $0.26 on revenues of $376 million. According to Chief Executive Officer Ken Schroeder, "Leading-edge capacity remains very tight and planning for some of the larger fab projects is moving ahead. Although cautious sentiment still predominates among several of our customers, orders of long lead-time equipment appear to be rising in the industry, as some chipmakers take the first step to expanding their future capacity." Schroeder continued, "Abnormally low levels of equipment spending helped chipmakers weather the technology industry downturn, but are simply not a viable long-term business strategy. Chipmakers must invest in leading-edge technology and capacity in order to remain competitive as next-generation applications enter production." KLA-Tencor reported that it ended the quarter with approximately six months of backlog at current shipping levels. Geographically, during the quarter, the strongest order activity originated from Taiwan, which was above its historical share. Korea, China, and Singapore were also above historical share while the United States and Europe fell below historical share during the quarter. Gross margins improved from 49.0 percent in the June quarter to 51.1 percent in the September quarter. Improvements in manufacturing and service costs contributed to the increase in gross margins. Operating expenses increased slightly to $125 million. The company increased total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $79 million to $1.57 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Accounts receivable decreased by $15 million to $209 million, driven by continued strong collections. Inventory increased by $15 million to $274 million due to the ramp-up of product build plans.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Description - ------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by KLA-Tencor Corporation dated January 22, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Posts Earnings of $45 Million on Revenues of $339 Million for Second Quarter of Fiscal 2004 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its second quarter of fiscal 2004, ended December 31, 2003. The company reported net income of $45 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22 on revenues of $339 million -- an increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. In comparison, the second quarter of fiscal 2003 resulted in net income of $29 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.15 on revenues of $335 million, while in its first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 KLA-Tencor realized net income of $37 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 on revenues of $318 million. According to Chief Executive Officer Ken Schroeder, "Rising chip demand fueled by an improving global economy, coupled with high capacity-utilization rates due to years of industry under-investment, is driving a strong upswing in capacity-related tool orders. Ramping yields of leading-edge processes remains a challenging task and our process control systems are playing a pivotal role in the industry's accelerating capacity expansion efforts. At the same time, we continue to benefit from new technology orders for process control equipment as chipmakers also work to develop even more challenging next-generation processes." Geographically, Korea, China, Singapore and Japan exhibited the strongest order growth compared to historical averages. The U.S. was 24 percent of orders, below its historical average of 25-30 percent; Taiwan was 18 percent, below its historical average of 20 percent; Korea, China and Singapore combined was 18 percent, higher than their historical average of 15 percent; Japan was 26 percent, higher than its historical average of 20 percent, and Europe was 14 percent, at its historical average of 15 percent. Gross margins improved three percent sequentially to 54 percent, which helped drive net income higher by 21 percent over the previous quarter. Improvements in capacity absorption and manufacturing efficiencies contributed to the gain in gross margins. KLA-Tencor increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $63 million to $1.63 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Higher product shipments led to an increase in accounts receivables of $37 million to $246 million. However, strong collections resulted in shipments based Days Sales Outstanding of 59 days. Inventory increased by $14 million to $288 million, as the Company expanded production to meet rising customer demand. The company has scheduled a live webcast of its second quarter fiscal 2004 earnings conference call for Thursday, January 22, 2004, at 2:00 p.m. (PT). Forward Looking Statements: Statements in this press release regarding the causes of an upswing in capacity-related tool orders, the industry's accelerating capacity expansion efforts, chipmakers developing more challenging next-generation processes, current order backlog, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Posts Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2004 Earnings of $66 Million on Revenues of $390 Million SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its third quarter of fiscal 2004, ended March 31, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $390 million, up 15% from $339 million in the previous quarter, and up 28% from $304 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The net income for the quarter was $66 million or $0.33 per diluted share, compared with net income of $45 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and $27 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. "Customer orders for our process control solutions continued to rise as we helped chipmakers lower their manufacturing costs and move to more advanced process technologies," stated Chief Executive Officer Ken Schroeder. "During the quarter KLA-Tencor benefited from all the major capital spending trends, as we partnered with chipmakers to expand both 200-mm and 300-mm capacity, advance existing capacity to next-generation processes, increase the efficiency of already operating production lines and overcome yield and reliability problems in next-generation pilot lines. While working to increase the profitability of our customers by speeding their time-to-market of next generation chips, we also enhanced our own profitability with cost reduction initiatives and improved capacity absorption. As a result of rising revenues and our improved cost-structure, we achieved gross profit margins in excess of 55 percent for the first time since the last quarter of fiscal 2001." Orders for wafer inspection equipment remained robust, while bookings growth was particularly strong in metrology and reticle inspection. On a geographic basis the U.S. and Korea posted the strongest bookings growth. The U.S. was 32 percent of orders, above its historical average of 25-30 percent; Korea, China and Singapore combined were 27 percent of orders, above their combined historical average of 15 percent; Taiwan was 16 percent, below its historical average of 20 percent; Japan was 14 percent, lower than its historical average of 20 percent, and Europe was 11 percent, lower than its historical average of 15 percent. Gross margins improved two percent sequentially to 56 percent in the March quarter from 54 percent in the December quarter, primarily driven by cost reduction initiatives along with improvements in capacity absorption. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $92 million to $1.72 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Accounts receivable increased by $116 million to $362 million on strong product shipments. Inventory increased by $22 million to $310 million, as the company continues to ramp production to meet customer demand.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Reports Earnings of $244 Million on Revenues of $1.5 Billion for Fiscal Year 2004; Fourth Quarter Earnings and Revenues Reach New Highs for the Fiscal Year SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and 2004 fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The company reported strong gains for both the quarter and full fiscal year. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $96 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.48 on revenues of $450 million, which represented an increase on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Revenues rose 16 percent from $390 million in the prior quarter and 46 percent from $308 million compared to the same period last year. Net income was also significantly higher, increasing from $66 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $29 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. For the full 2004 fiscal year, KLA-Tencor reported net income of $244 million or $1.21 per diluted share on revenues of $1.5 billion versus net income of $137 million or $0.70 per diluted share on revenues of $1.3 billion in its 2003 fiscal year. "Our strong financial performance for both the quarter and the year is the direct result of our customers' escalating investments in process control to help them stay on Moore's law and become the low cost producer of advanced chips," stated Ken Schroeder, President and Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor. "This trend is intensifying with each new device generation since process control helps semiconductor manufacturers speed technology ramps, increase manufacturing yields and lower their capital costs by extending the life of their existing process toolsets. As a result, process control continues to represent a larger portion of our customers' capital budgets." During the quarter, orders for wafer inspection systems rose sharply, while demand for reticle inspection and metrology systems remained strong. Geographically, Japan and Taiwan represented the largest sequential order increases and were above their historical average share of total orders. The U.S. was within its historical average, while Europe, Korea, China and Singapore were below their historical averages. Gross margins improved during the quarter, rising another two percent sequentially to 58 percent compared to 56 percent in the third quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by cost reduction initiatives. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $156 million to $1.88 billion. Accounts receivable increased $10 million to $373 million on higher product shipments. Inventory increased by $27 million to $337 million, as the company continued to ramp production to meet customer demand. Forward Looking Statements: Statements in this press release regarding customers' escalating investments in process control and trend of escalating investments in process control are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors and new and enhanced product offerings by competitors. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the company's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in the risk factors described in the company's SEC filings.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Reports Earnings of $116 Million on Revenue of $519 Million for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal 2005, ended September 30, 2004. Net income and earnings per diluted share rose to $116 million and $0.58 on revenues of $519 million, as the company reported sequential and year-over-year improvements in operating results. Revenues rose 15 percent from $450 million in the prior quarter and 63 percent from $318 million compared to the same period last year. Net income was also significantly higher, increasing from $96 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $37 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. "Our strong financial results reflect leading chipmakers' strategic investments in process control technology to help them stay on Moore's law and reduce the time and costs associated with producing next-generation chips," explained Ken Schroeder, President and Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor. "Our customers know that process control technology is instrumental to increasing their competitiveness and production success. Going forward we remain focused on investing in the solutions our customers will need to accelerate their development and production ramps at future nodes, while also optimizing the performance of their existing tools and technologies." KLA-Tencor reported that it ended the quarter with approximately six months of backlog at current shipping levels. Geographically, the strongest order activity originated from Japan, which was above its historical share. Korea, China, and Singapore were also above historical levels while order levels for the United States, Europe and Taiwan were below their historical averages during the quarter. Rising revenues and improved cost-structure resulted in record level gross margin, pretax, and operating margin percentages in the current quarter. Operating expenses increased from $141 million in the prior quarter to $146 million in the current quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased by $10 million to $1.89 billion and the company repurchased $74 million of its shares during the quarter. Accounts receivable decreased by $7 million to $366 million on strong collections, while inventory increased by $36 million to $373 million on new product introductions and higher planned production levels.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan 20, 2005KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its second quarter of fiscal 2005, ended December 31, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $533 million, up 3% from $519 million in the previous quarter, and up 57% from $339 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The net income for the quarter was $122 million or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with net income of $116 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and $45 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
"We had another quarter of strong financial results, driven by semiconductor manufacturers' continued investments in our leading-edge process control solutions," said Ken Schroeder, president and chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "As the pressure to stay on Moore's Law and control costs continues to increase, so also does the need for next-generation systems that can control the industry's increasingly complex technology and production processes. By developing systems that our customers will need to increase the efficiency of production lines and to meet the challenges of future device generations, we are working hard to deliver more value to our customers with lower cost-of-ownership and higher return-on-investment solutions."
KLA-Tencor ended the quarter with approximately 9 months of product related shipment and revenue backlog. On a geographic basis, Japan posted strong bookings growth. Japan was 36 percent of orders, higher than its historical average of 20 percent; Korea, China and Singapore combined were 24 percent of orders, above their combined historical average of 20 percent; U.S. was 17 percent of orders, below its historical average of 25 percent; Taiwan was 13 percent, below its historical average of 20 percent; and Europe was 10 percent, lower than its historical average of 15 percent.
Rising revenues, improved cost-structure and better product mix resulted in record level gross margin for the second consecutive fiscal quarter. Operating expenses increased from $146 million in the prior quarter to $160
 
million in the current quarter as a result of consolidation of acquisitions completed during the quarter as well continued investment in developing new process control technology solutions.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $39 million to $1.93 billion compared to the end of the prior quarter, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Inventory decreased by $23 million to $351 million, as the production output rose to meet customer demand. Accounts receivable increased by $81 million to $446 million on strong product shipments.

months. During such 60-month period, Executive shall be paid (i) Base Salary for the first 24 months, paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices (except as provided in the succeeding paragraph), (ii) a mutually agreeable level of compensation per month which is no lower than an hourly rate determined by dividing the annual Base Salary dollar amount by 2080 for the final 36 months, paid monthly, (iii) an annual bonus equal to the amount that would otherwise have been payable to Executive upon Executive's achievement of 100% of his individual bonus objectives (in distinction to Company bonus objectives, which shall be based upon actual Company performance for such fiscal year) for the Company's fiscal year in which Executive's transition to part-time employment occurs (the "Target Bonus"), (iv) for the Company's fiscal year ending in the period between the first anniversary of the date of termination of Executive's full-time employment and the second anniversary of the date of termination of Executive's full-time employment with the Company, an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have been payable to Executive upon Executive's achievement of 100% of his individual bonus objectives (in distinction to Company bonus objectives, which shall be based upon actual Company performance for such fiscal year) under the Company's bonus plan for such fiscal year (the "Second Year Bonus"), (v) for the Company's fiscal year ending in the period between the second anniversary of the date of termination of Executive's full-time employment and the third anniversary of the date of termination of Executive's full-time employment with the Company, an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have been payable to Executive upon Executive's achievement of 100% of his individual bonus objectives (in distinction to Company bonus objectives, which shall be based upon actual Company performance for such fiscal year) under the Company's bonus plan for such fiscal year (the "Third Year Bonus"), and (vi) a pro-rated bonus for the Company's fiscal year during which the third anniversary of the Part-Time Employment Term occurs determined by multiplying the amount that would otherwise have been payable to Executive upon Executive's achievement of 100% of his individual bonus objectives (in distinction to Company bonus objectives, which shall be based upon actual Company performance for such fiscal year) for such Company fiscal year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days between the first day of such Company fiscal year and the three-year anniversary of the Part-Time Employment Term and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (the "Pro-Rated Bonus"). Executive will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus for the fourth and fifth years of the Part-Time Employment Term. Any bonuses to be paid pursuant to clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this paragraph will be paid no later than two and one half months following the completion of the Company's relevant fiscal year.
     Any Base Salary to be paid pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding paragraph will not be paid during the six-month period following the commencement of the Part-Time Employment Term, unless the parties (acting in good faith) mutually agree that paying such amounts immediately following his transition to a Part-Time Employee would not be in violation of Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in which case such amounts shall be paid in accordance with normal payroll practices. If no Base Salary is paid to Executive as a result of the previous sentence, on the first day following such six-month period (or such other time as may be necessary under Section 22 hereof), the Company will pay Executive a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amounts that would have otherwise been paid to Executive under clause (i) of the preceding paragraph. Thereafter, Executive will receive his Base

          . If the Company desires to terminate Executive's full-time employment with the Company other than for Cause, then the Company shall provide Executive with written notice of such termination. If the Executive's full-time employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, then, subject to Executive entering into and not revoking a Release, Executive shall remain employed by the Company as a Part-Time Employee on the terms described herein and shall receive the same benefits as set forth in subsection (c) above.
d.
Termination of Full-Time Employment by Company Other than for Cause
          . If during the Part-Time Employment Term, Executive becomes a full-time employee (or equivalent thereof) of an entity that is not a "Competing Company" (as defined in Section 8 hereof), Executive (i) shall have his Base Salary reduced to a mutually agreeable amount per month (determined based on the level of services expected to be rendered to the Company) in exchange for Executive providing mutually agreed upon services to the Company, (ii) shall not be eligible to receive any Target Bonus, Second Year Bonus, Third Year Bonus or Pro-Rated Bonus to the extent not already earned by Executive, and (iii) shall not be eligible to participate or receive benefits under any other employee benefit plans, policies, practices or arrangements of the Company or its predecessors (except that Executive and his spouse shall continue receiving the Retiree Health Benefit (as defined in Section 5), and subject to Section 7(f) below with respect to the vesting of Executive's equity awards and Section 11 hereof relating to the treatment of any Retention Option/SAR Grants and Retention Restricted Stock/Unit Grants, as such terms are defined in Section 11 hereof). For the purposes of the foregoing, the Target Bonus, Second Year Bonus and Third Year Bonus shall be deemed earned, to the extent otherwise payable, if Executive is a Part-Time Employee and is not employed by a non-Competing Company through the last day of the fiscal year to which such bonuses relate, and the Pro-Rated Bonus shall be deemed earned, to the extent otherwise payable, on the date of the third anniversary of the Part-Time Employment Term if Executive is not employed by a non-Competing Company through the date of such anniversary.
e.
Reduction of Part-Time Employment Term Compensation and Benefits If Executive Becomes Employed by a Non-Competing Company
          .

Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 9 shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants (the "Accountants"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes; provided that if benefits are reduced or deferred, the Executive shall choose the order in which such benefits are reduced or deferred.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 27, 2005  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal 2006, ended September 30, 2005. The company reported net income of $77 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.38 on revenues of $484 million compared to net income of $105 million or $0.52 per diluted shares on revenue of $492 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and net income of $116 million or $0.58 per diluted shares on revenue of $519 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The results include the impact from adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of SFAS 123 (R). The company included equity based compensation expenses of $24 million or $0.12 per diluted share, after income tax expenses, in its costs and operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Excluding the $24 million of equity based compensation, net income would have been $101 million and earnings per diluted share would have been $0.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
"We continue to introduce innovative yield management technologies to improve the competitiveness and production success of our customers. As a result of this suite of market-leading products, we delivered another strong quarter with increasing orders and strong earnings," explained Ken Schroeder, chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "Ramping yields of leading-edge processes remains a challenging task and KLA-Tencor is playing a pivotal role in the industry's efforts to expand production capacity and speed new products to market."
KLA-Tencor reported ending the quarter with approximately 9 months of product-related shipment and revenue backlog. On a geographic basis, Taiwan and Japan posted strong bookings for the quarter ended
 
September 30, 2005. Taiwan was 27 percent of orders, above its historical average of 20 percent; Japan was 23 percent of orders, higher than its historical average of 20 percent; U.S. was 25 percent of orders, and consistent with its historical average of 25 percent; Europe was 13 percent of orders, lower than its historical average of 15 percent; and Korea, China and Singapore combined were 12 percent of orders, below their combined historical average of 20 percent.
KLA-Tencor's financial position remained strong with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion and no long term debt. Inventory increased by $38 million to $396 million as a result of higher shipments to Japanese customers that remain in inventory until customer acceptance, and higher field inventory to support customer service requirements of new products. Accounts receivable decreased by $26 million to $307 million.
Statements in this press release regarding the benefit to customers of KLA-Tencor's products and our future financial performance are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors and new and enhanced product offerings by competitors, cancellation of orders by customers and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the company's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in the risk factors described in the company's SEC filings.
Forward Looking Statements:
For comparison purposes, the company makes reference to certain net income and earnings per share results that were consistent with GAAP when presented in prior quarters, but are now inconsistent with GAAP due to changes in accounting standards. These results were reached by excluding non-cash, equity-based compensation expenses. We reference those results to allow a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods. Our reference to these results from prior periods should be considered in addition to results that are prepared under current accounting standards but should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented as consistent with GAAP.
KLA-Tencor is the world leader in yield management and process control solutions for semiconductor manufacturing and related industries. Headquartered in San Jose, Calif., with operations around the world, KLA-Tencor ranked #6 on S&P's 2002 index of the top 500 companies in the U.S. KLA-Tencor is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol KLAC.

Exhibit 99.1
SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 15, 2005KLA-Tencor Corp. (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that it has appointed Richard P. (Rick) Wallace, age 45, as its next chief executive officer (CEO), effective January 1, 2006. Wallace, who currently serves as KLA-Tencor's president and chief operating officer (COO), will succeed Kenneth L. Schroeder, age 59, who plans to retire as CEO at the end of this year. Wallace will assume Schroeder's seat on the board, while Schroeder will become a senior advisor to the company. In addition, the company announced that John Kispert, KLA-Tencor's chief financial officer (CFO), will assume the role of president and COO, also effective January 1, 2006. Kispert will serve in both roles until a new CFO is appointed.
"KLA-Tencor is very fortunate to have a long-term member of its management team with the breadth of experience and capabilities needed to lead the company through its next phase of growth," said Kenneth Levy, KLA-Tencor's founder and chairman of the board. "Rick has held key leadership positions throughout KLA-Tencor, including the company's Wafer Inspection and Customer Groups. He has realized an impressive record of accomplishments in each of his management positions, and is uniquely qualified for the role of CEO at the company."
John Kispert, a ten-year KLA-Tencor veteran, will assume the role of the company's president and COO. Mr. Kispert has served as the company's CFO since July 2000, and will continue to hold this position until a replacement is announced. He has also held senior management roles in manufacturing, sales operations, and service.
"John is ideally suited to serve as president and COO of our company," said Levy. "Over his long tenure at KLA-Tencor he has proven that he combines a thorough understanding of our business and a passion for excellence in operations with a focus on superior financial performance."
"Lastly, on behalf of our entire board and all our employees, I want to thank Ken Schroeder for the significant contributions he's made to the company," Levy concluded. "During Ken's tenure as CEO, KLA-Tencor's sales grew from $1 billion to $2.1 billion and retained earnings tripled from $700 million to $2.1 billion. KLA-Tencor further solidified its position as the clear market leader in yield management technologies for the global semiconductor industry. Ken has also been instrumental in building one of the industry's strongest management teams and has laid the groundwork for our continued growth."
 
Wallace, a 17-year veteran of KLA-Tencor, has successfully held some of the company's most critical leadership positions, and played an important role in furthering KLA-Tencor's strong market and technology position. His experience at KLA-Tencor runs the gamut from his appointment to president and COO this past July to his start with the company in 1988 as an applications engineer. Among the business units he has been responsible for are the Wafer Inspection Group, Reticle and Photomask Inspection Division, Films and Surface Technology Division, Software and Customer Groups, and the Lithography Control Group. Wallace earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan and his master's degree in engineering management from Santa Clara University.
Kispert was appointed CFO of KLA-Tencor in 2000, and before that served as vice president of finance. Highlighting the success of his efforts to improve the company's already-solid financial execution efforts, he has been named one of America's best CFOs by magazine. In addition to his CFO duties, he has been responsible for running the company's customer service and support, manufacturing, and sales operations. Previously, as vice president of operations for KLA-Tencor's Wafer Inspection Group, Kispert helped further solidify the unit's market leadership, while also improving its product development and manufacturing efficiency. Earlier, he also served as controller for the company's wafer, reticle and SEMspec inspection divisions. Before joining KLA-Tencor in 1995, Kispert held several senior management positions with IBM. He received his bachelor's degree in political science from Grinnell College and his MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 26, 2006KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its second quarter of fiscal 2006, ended December 31, 2005. The company reported net income of $77 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.38 on revenues of $488 million compared to net income of $77 million or $0.38 per diluted share on revenue of $484 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and net income of $122 million or $0.61 per diluted share on revenue of $533 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The results for the fiscal 2006 quarters include the impact from adoption of SFAS 123 (R) "Stock Based Compensation". The company recorded after-tax equity-based compensation expenses of $25 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and $24 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, in its costs and operating expenses. Excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, net income would have been $102 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and $101 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
"We continue to work closely with our customers to help them maximize their yield faster in the face of formidable technology and economic challenges," stated Rick Wallace, chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "Demand for our solutions remains strong as semiconductor manufacturers count on us as a trusted partner that can help them realize greater profitability through faster product introduction cycles, accelerated transistor innovation and enhanced manufacturing efficiency."
KLA-Tencor reported ending the quarter with approximately nine months of product-related shipment and revenue backlog. On a geographic basis, Korea, China and Singapore were 32 percent of orders, above
 
their combined historical average of 20 percent; Japan was 21 percent of orders, higher than its historical average of 20 percent; Taiwan was 18 percent of orders, lower than its historical average of 20 percent; U.S. was 17 percent of orders, lower than its historical average of 25 percent; and Europe was 12 percent of orders, lower than its historical average of 15 percent.
KLA-Tencor's financial position remained strong with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion and no long term debt. Inventory increased by $16 million to $412 million compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher build plans to support increased customer demand. Accounts receivable increased by $65 million to $372 million compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in Japan.
Statements in this press release regarding the benefit to customers of KLA-Tencor's products, demand for KLA-Tencor's products and its future financial performance are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors and new and enhanced product offerings by competitors, cancellation of orders by customers and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the company's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in the risk factors described in the company's SEC filings.
Forward Looking Statements:
For comparison purposes, the company makes reference to certain net income and earnings per share results that were consistent with GAAP when presented in prior quarters, but are now inconsistent with GAAP due to changes in accounting standards. These results were reached by excluding non-cash, equity-based compensation expenses. We reference those results to allow a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods. Our reference to these results from prior periods should be considered in addition to results that are prepared under current accounting standards but should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented as consistent with GAAP.

respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Stock Options and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such assumed Company Stock Options (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock Options remain outstanding.

From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates will get the full benefit of any such funds, accruals or reserves.

     C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised that, because, at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of the Company, the undersigned may be deemed an affiliate of the Company, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless such sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been registered under the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, or pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the SEC staff, is otherwise exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or (ii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This letter is being delivered in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""), dated as of February 22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the ""), and South Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the ""). The undersigned officer of each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations herein are true, correct and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time:
Merger Agreement
1
Parent
Company
MergerSub
Merger
     1. Parent's and Merger Sub's principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide business purposes not related to taxes.
     2. The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was determined by arm's length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
     3. The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by each holder of
 
      All defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.
1
 
Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
     4. The Parent Common Stock for which Company Common Stock will be exchanged in the Merger will be entitled to vote in the election of directors of Parent and on all other matters put forth to the stockholders of Parent.
     5. Pursuant to the Merger, as of the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws or exchanged for cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.
2
     6. To the best knowledge of the management of Parent, at the Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of rights pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parent's acquisition or retention of control of the Company.
     7. Parent has no plan or intention to cause or permit the Company, after the Effective Time, to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock) that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Company.
     8. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each holder of Company Common Stock will be aggregated, and no holder of Company Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock, except for any cases in which a holder of Company Common Stock holds beneficial interests in shares of the Company through more than one account and such multiple accounts cannot be aggregated, either because the beneficial interest
 
      For purposes of this representation letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least (i) 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation.
2
 
cannot be identified or it would be improper or impracticable to do so, and in any cases in which the same stockholder owns stock in multiple accounts and Parent cannot aggregate those accounts through use of their common taxpayer identification number or EIN or otherwise (in which case no account will receive more than a fraction of one share in cash).
     9. Neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has any plan or intention, directly or indirectly, to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than possible repurchases of unvested shares of employees or consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement by Parent (i) made in the open market for stock of the Parent which is widely held and publicly traded (except that Parent may acquire stock in block trades made directly with an entity that has represented to Parent that such entity did not acquire such stock in the Merger) and (ii) limited to, in the aggregate, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time.
     10. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former holders of Company Common Stock by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Common Stock.
     11. As of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent will own beneficially or of record, or, will have owned beneficially or of record during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the Company.
     12. Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in control of MergerSub. Parent has no plan or intention to cause MergerSub to, and MergerSub has no plan or intention to, issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Parent not being in control of MergerSub at the Effective Time.
     13. MergerSub is being formed solely to effect the Merger and it will not conduct any business or other activities prior to the Merger. MergerSub will have no liabilities that will be assumed by the Company in the Merger and it will not transfer any assets to the Company in the Merger that are subject to any liabilities.
     14. Immediately after the Effective Time, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent and MergerSub, the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets and the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of MergerSub's net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of MergerSub's
 
gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid or incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger, including amounts used (or to be used) by the Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws, amounts paid by the Company to stockholders who receive cash or other property, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Company, or to repay any indebtedness of the Company, as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Company to stockholders of the Company (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, will be treated as constituting assets of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
     15. Following the Merger, Parent will continue the conduct of the Company's historic business or use a significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. If Parent's Qualified Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the Company business assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent will be treated as conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parent's Qualified Group own a significant interest and have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This letter is being delivered in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""), dated as of February 22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the ""), and South Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the ""). The undersigned officer of the Company, on behalf of the Company, hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations herein are true, correct and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time:
Merger Agreement
1
Parent
Company
MergerSub
Merger
     1. The Company's principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide business purposes not related to taxes.
     2. The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was determined by arm's length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
 
 
EXHIBIT D
     3. The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by each holder of Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
     4. Pursuant to the Merger, as of the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent. For purposes of this representation letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least (i) 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws or exchanged for cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.
     5. At the Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of rights pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parent's acquisition or retention of control of the Company.
     6. The Company has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock) after the Effective Time that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Company.
     7. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock.
     8. Neither the Company nor any affiliate of the Company has redeemed or will redeem any stock of the Company prior to and in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger or has made or will make any distributions with respect to stock of the Company prior to and in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger.
     9. To the best knowledge of the management of the Company, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has any plan or intention, directly or indirectly,
 
EXHIBIT D
to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than possible repurchases of unvested shares of employees or consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement by Parent (i) made in the open market for stock of the Parent which is widely held and publicly traded (except that Parent may acquire stock in block trades made directly with an entity that has represented to Parent that such entity did not acquire such stock in the Merger) and (ii) limited to, in the aggregate, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time.
     10. After the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former holders of Company Common Stock by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Common Stock.
     11. To the best knowledge of the management of the Company, as of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of record during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the Company.
     12. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, at least 90% of the fair market value of MergerSub's net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of MergerSub's gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid or incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger, including amounts used (or to be used) by the Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws, amounts paid by the Company to stockholders who receive cash or other property, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Company, or to repay any indebtedness of the Company, as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Company to stockholders of the Company (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, will be treated as constituting assets of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
     13. No assets of the Company have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from continuing the historic business of the
 
EXHIBIT D
Company or from using a significant portion of its historic business assets in a business following the Merger. Following the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, Parent will continue the conduct of the Company's historic business or use a significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. If Parent's Qualified Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the Company business assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent will be treated as conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parent's Qualified Group own a significant interest and have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business. As defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(iii), a Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and each of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations.
     14. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock each will pay its or their own expenses, if any, incurred in connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), the Company has not agreed to pay or assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Company Common Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), no liabilities of the Company or, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, the Company stockholders will be assumed by Parent, and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, Parent will not acquire in the Merger any Company Common Stock subject to any liabilities.
     15. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.
     16. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of the Company will equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus (without duplication) the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the Company's assets are subject.
     17. The Company is not a regulated investment company within the meaning of Section 851 of the Code, a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code, or a corporation fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of whose assets are stock and securities and eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment (each, an
 
EXHIBIT D
""). For purposes of this representation, in making the 50% and 80% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiary's assets, and (ii) a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding. In determining total assets there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities, and assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an Investment Company.
Investment Company
     18. None of the compensation received or to be received by any employees or independent contractors of the Company is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Company Common Stock to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by any employee or independent contractor of the Company in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. Any compensation paid or to be paid to any stockholder of the Company who will be an employee of or perform services for Parent, the Company, or any affiliate thereof after the Merger, will be determined by bargaining at arm's length.
     19. The Company is not, and will not be, under the jurisdiction of a court in a "Title 11 or similar case." For purposes of the foregoing, a "Title 11 or similar case" means a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a United States federal or state court.
     20. The Merger will be carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and none of the material terms and conditions therein has been or will be waived or modified.
     21. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.
     22. The Company will not take any position on any federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations.
     23. The undersigned officer is authorized to make all the certifications, representations and covenants on behalf of the Company set forth herein.

We reference those results to allow a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods. Our reference to these results from prior periods should be considered in addition to results that are prepared under current accounting standards but should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented as consistent with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
KLA-TENCOR PROVIDES UPDATE ON SPECIAL COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION
SAN JOSE, Calif., June 30, 2006  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that a Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in prior years likely differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. The Special Committee has not completed its investigation and is continuing its review of these matters. The Special Committee has not yet determined whether any resulting compensation charges are material or whether the Company ultimately will restate previously issued financial statements.
The Company previously announced that its Board of Directors has appointed a Special Committee of independent directors to conduct an internal investigation relating to stock options granted to members of senior management and the employees of the Company. The Special Committee, assisted by independent legal counsel and accounting experts, is investigating the timing of such grants, as well as their related accounting treatment.
Based on the Special Committee's investigation to date, the Company now anticipates that it may record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense. The Company has not yet determined the amount of such charges or the resulting tax impact of these actions. In the event that the Company determines that these items are material, KLA-Tencor may be required to restate its financial statements for the relevant prior fiscal periods.
Statements in this press release regarding KLA-Tencor's financial statements for prior periods and the possible conclusions or determinations to be made by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, or the Special Committee are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to, the final conclusions of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, the Special Committee, and the Company's independent public accountants concerning matters related to the company's stock option grants.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On July 11, 2006, KLA-Tencor Corporation and ADE Corporation issued a joint press release announcing that KLA-Tencor's acquisition of ADE will be delayed pending approval from German antitrust authorities. The acquisition has already been cleared by the antitrust authorities in the United States and in all other applicable jurisdictions.
German authorities have notified KLA-Tencor that a Phase II investigation of the proposed acquisition of ADE by KLA-Tencor has begun. KLA-Tencor and ADE stated that they will continue to cooperate with the German authorities to facilitate a timely review. Both firms are confident that the acquisition will ultimately receive clearance.
The special meeting of ADE stockholders to consider the acquisition will be held as scheduled on July 13, 2006. Assuming that the acquisition receives stockholder approval, the parties anticipate that the acquisition will be completed once German antitrust clearance is obtained.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 27, 2006 KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced selected financial results for its fourth quarter and 2006 fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.
Revenue for the quarter was $579 million, compared to $492 million for the fourth quarter last year, an increase of 18%. Revenue for the year was $2.069 billion, compared to $2.085 billion for the prior year.
"We had a good quarter for customer orders with strong demand for our leading-edge yield management solutions, which enable leading IC manufacturers to speed time to market and profit on their next-generation devices," stated Rick Wallace, Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor. "Operating profit excluding stock-based compensation was above our expectations for the quarter and we continue our focus on delivering strong financial performance and the most advanced process control technology."
KLA-Tencor reported ending the quarter with approximately nine months of product-related shipment and revenue backlog. On a geographic basis, Taiwan was 25 percent of orders, higher than its historical average of 20 percent; Korea, China and Singapore were 21 percent of orders, slightly higher than their combined historical average of 20 percent; U.S. was 25 percent of orders, consistent with its historical average of 25 percent; Japan was 20 percent of orders, consistent with its historical average of 20 percent; and Europe was 9 percent of orders, lower than its historical average of 15 percent.
KLA-Tencor's financial position remained strong with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.3 billion and no long term debt. Accounts receivable decreased by $16 million compared to the prior quarter to $440 million on strong collections.
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors has appointed a Special Committee of independent directors to conduct an internal investigation relating to stock options granted to the employees of the Company.
 
As disclosed on June 30, 2006, the Special Committee has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in prior years likely differs from the recorded grant dates of such awards. The Special Committee has not yet determined whether any resulting compensation charges or tax implications are material or whether the Company ultimately will restate previously issued financial statements.
As a result of the on-going investigation and the potential for restatement, the Company is unable to provide detailed GAAP or non-GAAP financials for the quarter or year ended June 30, 2006. In addition, the Company will not file its annual report on Form 10-K until after the completion of the investigation. The Company does not expect the investigation to be completed until after the date the Form 10-K is required to be filed.
Statements in this press release regarding KLA-Tencor's business outlook, future financial and operating results, and overall future prospects are forward looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors and new and enhanced product offerings by competitors, cancellation of orders by customers and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the risk factors and other disclosures contained in the Company's previously filed Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Forward Looking Statements:
As discussed above, the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has not completed its review of various stock option-related matters, as described in the Company's press release of June 30, 2006. There can be no assurance that the outcome of that review will not result in changes to or a restatement of financial results provided by the Company for this or any historical period which could be material. In addition, the Special Committee's investigation and possible conclusions may have an impact on the amount and timing of previously awarded stock-based compensation and other additional expenses to be recorded; accounting adjustments to our financial statements for the periods in question; our ability to file required reports with the SEC on a timely basis; our ability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market for continued listing of our shares; potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including shareholder litigation and action by the SEC and/or other governmental agencies; and negative tax or other implications for the Company resulting from any accounting adjustments or other factors.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On August 3, 2006, the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") adopted a majority stockholder vote standard for uncontested director elections.

In addition, if an incumbent director nominee is not elected, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors immediately upon certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation within 180 days from the date of the certification of the election results and will publicly disclose its decision. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.

On August 23, 2006, ADE Corporation extended from August 28, 2006 to November 10, 2006 the "end date" under the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement between KLA-Tencor and ADE. Unless the merger has been completed by such date or such date is further extended by mutual agreement of KLA-Tencor and ADE, either party may thereafter terminate the Merger Agreement. ADE extended this date to allow KLA-Tencor additional time to obtain regulatory clearance from German antitrust authorities, who as previously reported, notified KLA-Tencor on Monday, July 10, 2006 of the commencement of a Phase II investigation of the proposed merger.
A closing date will be established once the parties have cleared or waived all conditions to close, including regulatory clearance from the German antitrust authorities. Both ADE and KLA-Tencor continue to be confident that the merger will be completed once German antitrust clearance is obtained.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., September 14, 2006  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that the Special Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company is continuing its internal investigation relating to stock options granted to employees of the Company. As anticipated in the Company's news release dated July 24, 2006, the Company will not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K until the internal investigation is complete. Thus, the Company did not file its Form 10-K on September 13, 2006 as required, and has filed Form 12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) also as required.
As a result of the delayed filing of the Company's Form 10-K, the Company today received a NASDAQ Staff Determination notice indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and that its common stock is subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The notice, which the Company expected, was issued in accordance with standard NASDAQ procedures. The Company will appeal this determination and request a hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. The Company's appeal and hearing request will automatically stay the delisting of the Company's common stock. Pending the Panel's decision, the Company's shares will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
As previously announced, the Special Committee reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in prior years likely differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Neither the Special Committee nor the Board of Directors of the Company has yet determined whether any resulting compensation or tax charges are material or whether the Company ultimately will restate previously issued financial statements. The Company is focused on resolving these issues as quickly as possible and plans to file its Form 10-K as soon as practicable following completion of the Special Committee's investigation.

Item 1.01: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 19, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved awards of restricted stock units covering a total of 2,530,689 shares of the Company's common stock to employees of the Company, including the executive officers. The restricted stock units were awarded under the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), and each unit will entitle the recipient to one share of common stock when the applicable vesting requirements for that unit are satisfied. However, for each share actually issued under the awarded units, the share reserve under the Plan will be reduced by 1.8 shares, as provided under the terms of such Plan.
The executive officers who were awarded restricted stock units and the maximum number of units awarded to each such officer are as follows:
The restricted stock units awarded to the executive officers are subject to both performance vesting tied to the Company's operating income for the 2007 fiscal year and service vesting over a four-year period measured from the award date. The actual number of shares to which each executive officer will become entitled under his or her award will be determined as follows:
          (i) As soon as practicable following the completion of the Company's audited financial statements for the 2007 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee will determine the level at which the performance goal for that year has been attained and on the basis of that assessment determine the specific number of restricted stock units each executive officer will have the potential to earn based on his or her continued service. Such number may range from 0 restricted stock units (if less than threshold attainment of the performance goal is attained) to the maximum number awarded to such individual (if attainment is at or above the maximum specified goal).
          (ii) The executive officer will vest in 50% of the number of restricted stock units determined under subparagraph (i) upon his or her completion of two years of service with the Company measured from the award date and will vest in the remaining 50% upon his or her completion of an additional two years of service.
A copy of both the form Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification and the form Restricted Stock Unit Agreement that will be used to evidence the awards made to the executive officers are filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.19
PERFORMANCE-VESTING
Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification
Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that the Board of Directors has granted to you an award of Restricted Stock Units under the KLA-Tencor Corporation 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "EIP4 Equity Plan"). Subject to the provisions of the EIP4 Equity Plan and the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, the principal features of this award are as follows:
 
The issuance of shares of KLA-Tencor Corporation common stock upon the vesting of Restricted Stock Units is subject to compliance with all of the applicable requirements of all laws or regulations with respect to such units. Neither the grant of this award nor the vesting schedule alter the terms of your employment, which remain at-will and subject to termination by KLA-Tencor or you at any time, with or without cause or notice.
By accepting this award, you agree and understand that this award is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification, the EIP4 Equity Plan document, and the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. For copies of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement and the EIP4 Equity Plan document, please see the Employee Stock Services Web-site, which can be accessed through the KLA-Tencor Intranet site: http://ktwebdev.kla-tencor.com/treasury/kla_web/sop_features.html
PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THIS AWARD.
THIS MEMOIS YOUR OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION OF THIS AWARD. NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU CONCERNING THIS AWARD.
,
 

 
Exhibit 10.20
     1.     . The Company hereby grants to the Employee named in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification an award of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification and subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). When the Shares are issued pursuant to RSUs which vest in accordance with paragraph 3, the par value per Share will be deemed paid by the Employee as a result of the services rendered by the Employee prior to the applicable vesting date. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
Grant
     2.     . Each RSU represents the right to receive one Share on the vesting date of that unit. Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs. Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
Company's Obligation
     3.     . Subject to paragraph 4, the Employee will vest in the RSUs awarded by this Agreement according to the vesting schedule specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification. Accordingly, such vesting may be tied to the attainment of established performance goals and/or the completion of a specified period of Service Provider status.
Vesting Schedule
     4.     . The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the RSU at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such RSUs will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. If the Administrator, in its discretion, accelerates the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the RSUs, the Shares underlying those accelerated RSUs shall nevertheless be issued at the same time or times as if such RSUs had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification (whether or not the Employee remains in Service Provider status as of such date(s)). Accordingly, there shall be no acceleration of the payment date of the RSUs for which vesting is accelerated pursuant to this paragraph 4 or the issuance date of the Shares underlying those vesting-accelerated RSUs.
Administrator Discretion
     5.     . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification, if the Employee terminates service as a Service Provider for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and without any payment (in cash or otherwise) due the Employee.
Forfeiture upon Termination as Service Provider
 
     6.     . Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate or designated beneficiaries) in Shares on the date those RSUs vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification or as soon thereafter as practicable, subject to the tax withholding provisions of paragraph 8. Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 4 will be paid in Shares to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate or designated beneficiaries) in accordance with the provisions of such paragraph, subject to tax withholding provisions of paragraph 8. In the event of any accelerated vesting of the RSUs pursuant to the provisions of Section 18(c)(ii) of the Plan, the Shares underlying those accelerated RSUs shall be issued on the accelerated vesting date or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the tax withholding provisions of paragraph 8. For each RSU that vests, the Employee will receive one Share. In no event shall the Shares be issued later than the later of (i) the close of the calendar year in which the Shares vest or (for vesting-accelerated RSUs under paragraph 4) would have vested in the absence of such acceleration or (ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following such actual or deemed vesting date.
Payment upon Vesting
     7.     . Any distribution or delivery of Shares to be made to the Employee in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Employee's estate or the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of the RSUs. The Shares shall be issued on the issuance date determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6. Any such administrator, executor or beneficiary must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as such and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. The Employee may make a beneficiary designation with respect to the RSUs by filing the appropriate form with the Administrator or its designate
Payments after Death
     8.     . Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, spin-off transaction, extraordinary distribution (whether made in cash, securities or other property), recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Administrator to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award. Such adjustments shall be made in such manner as the Administrator deems appropriate in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder.
Adjustment in Shares
     9.     . When the Shares are issued as payment for vested RSUs, the Company will withhold a portion of the vested RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to pay the minimum federal, state and local income, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, either requires or otherwise permits the Employee to make alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Company for such withholdings in advance of the arising of any withholding obligations.

By accepting this RSU award, the Employee expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and to any additional cash withholding as provided for in this paragraph 9.

Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares are issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or Employee's broker.
Rights as Stockholder
     11.     . The Employee's employment or other Service Provider status with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at-will basis only. Accordingly, the terms of the Employee's employment or other Service Provider status with the Company and its Subsidiaries will be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing or retaining the Employee (as the case may be), and the Company or the Subsidiary will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment or service relationship of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause or notice.
No Effect on Employment
     12.     . Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement must be addressed to the Company at 3 Technology Drive, Milpitas, California 95035, : Stock Administration, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing or electronically.

Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.
Grant is Not Transferable
     14.     . Subject to the provisions of paragraph 16, the Company shall use its best efforts to assure that the Shares issued in payment of the vested RSUs are registered under the federal securities laws or qualify for an available exemption from such registration requirements and are accordingly freely tradable.

Binding Agreement
     16.     . If at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to the Employee (or his or her estate or beneficiary), such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority. In no event, however, shall any Shares be issued in contravention of applicable federal and state securities laws or other regulatory requirements.
Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock
     17.     . This Agreement and the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification are subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement or the Restricted Stock Unit Award Notification and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern.
Plan Governs

The Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any RSUs have vested).

ITEM 1.01: Entry into Definitive Material Agreement
On September 29, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") established the Company performance goals which are to be in effect for the 2007 fiscal year under the Company's Performance Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), an incentive bonus plan administered in conformity with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The performance goals are tied to the Company's operating income for the 2007 fiscal year and to certain strategic factors for such fiscal year based on the Company's pre-tax profit and operating margin. For certain participants, the bonus potentials are also tied to profit from operations at group or division levels within the Company. The Compensation Committee has also approved the bonus potential for each participant at threshold, target and maximum levels of Company performance for the 2007 fiscal year. Following the close of the 2007 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee will determine the actual bonus amount for each participant based on the actual levels at which the performance goals for that year are attained, and the actual bonus amounts (if any) are expected to be paid within ninety days after the close of such year.
Performance Bonus Plan.
The following executive officers will participate in the Plan for the 2007 fiscal year, with bonus potentials at the following threshold, target and maximum levels:
The actual bonus award (if any) may be higher or lower depending upon the actual level at which the performance goals for the 2007 fiscal year are attained, but no executive officer will receive a bonus award under the Plan in excess of the maximum dollar award indicated for him above, and no executive officer will receive any bonus award under the Plan if the threshold level of Company performance is not attained.
On September 29, 2006, the Compensation Committee also set the Company performance goals which are to be in effect for the 2007 fiscal year under the Company's Outstanding Corporate Performance Bonus Plan (the "OCPB Plan"). The performance goals are tied to the Company's profit from operations and operating margin for the 2007 fiscal year. The Compensation Committee also approved the bonus potential for each participant at threshold, target and maximum levels of Company performance for the 2007 fiscal year. Following the close of the 2007 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee will determine the actual bonus amount for each participant based on the actual levels at which the performance goals for that year are attained, and the actual bonus amounts (if any) are expected to be paid within ninety days after the close of such year.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The disclosure set forth in Item 4.02 below is incorporated by reference.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
A Special Committee of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") has delivered a report to the Board of Directors, which concluded that incorrect measurement dates were used for certain stock option grants made principally during the period from July 1, 1997 through July 30, 2002. The Board of Directors of the Company has not concluded its evaluation of the factors that led to the use of incorrect measurement dates of stock options. The Board of Directors has concluded that the Company will need to restate certain of its historical financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The Company has not determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impacts, the impact on internal control over financial reporting, or which specific periods may require restatement. However, the effects on previously reported financial statements are expected to be material. The Special Committee and the Board of Directors will continue to be actively involved in reviewing information and determining the appropriate actions to be taken by the Company with respect to this matter.
Accordingly, on September 27, 2006, the Board of Directors concluded that financial statements and all earnings and press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, should no longer be relied upon, including the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1998 through 2005, the interim periods contained therein, and the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006. The Company's management and the Special Committee have discussed this matter with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company issued a press release concerning this matter on September 28, 2006, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
     On September 27, 2006, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") determined that its historical financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated as a result of improper accounting for option grants made to officers and employees. The specific fiscal years which will need to be restated has yet been determined. However, the Company has decided to suspend temporarily employee participation in several equity incentive programs because the S-8 registration statements covering the shares of common stock issuable under those programs incorporate one or more financial statements that will likely have to be restated. As part of such suspension, participants in the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") will be subject to a blackout period during which they will be precluded from acquiring shares of the Company's common stock under that plan.
     The blackout period began at 7:00 AM Pacific Time on September 28, 2006 and is currently anticipated to end at 7:00 AM Pacific Time on the day immediately following the day on which the restated financial statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). However, for the Company's executive officers and Board Members, the blackout period will continue until 7:00 AM on the third business day following the date the restatements are filed. During the applicable blackout period, participants in the 401(k) plan will be precluded from directing the investment of their plan contributions into shares of the Company's common stock or from moving their existing account balance under the plan into the Company common stock fund. In addition, the executive officers will not be allowed during the blackout period to move their existing 401(k) plan account balances out of any Company common stock in which those accounts may now be invested. The Company gave notice of the blackout period to its executive officers and Board members on September 29, 2007. The Company was not able to provide any advance notice because the imposition of the blackout period was due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. A copy of the blackout notice is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
     As a result of the blackout period under the 401(k) Plan, executive officers and Board members will be prohibited pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring any shares of the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the Company's common stock, while that blackout period remains in effect. The prohibition covers any acquisition of the Company's common stock or related derivative security in connection with the covered individual's service or employment with the Company (e.g., an option grant or restricted stock or restricted stock unit award) or any sale of the Company's common stock which the executive officer or Board member acquired in connection with his or her service in such capacity (e.g., through the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units). However, the prohibition would not extend to any transactions effected pursuant to certain pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 plans.
     Any questions concerning the blackout period or the transactions affected by the blackout period are to be addressed to Jeff Hall, the Company's Chief Financial Officer at the Company's headquarters at 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, California 95134 or by telephoning him at (408) 875-3000.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     In conjunction with its determination that its financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated, the Company has notified participants in its 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2000 Nonstatutory Plan, the Restated 1982 Stock Option Plan, as amended, the 1993 Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1990 Stock Option Plan, the 1998 Outside Director Option Plan, the Excess Profit Stock Plan and the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that during a designated suspension period, they will not be able to exercise their outstanding stock options, make contributions to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan or purchase shares of common stock under such plan, or receive allocations of Company common stock under the Excess Profit Stock Plan. The designated suspension period coincides with the blackout period described above under Item 5.04.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., September 28, 2006  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that it will restate previously issued financial statements to correct the Company's past accounting for stock options. Based on a report received from a Special Committee of the Board of Directors, the Board concluded that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants were used for financial accounting purposes, principally during the periods July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002. As a result, the Company will be required to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to those past stock option grants.
The Company has not determined the exact amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which specific reporting periods may require restatement. Accordingly, the Company is filing a Form 8-K today stating that the financial statements and all earnings and press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, should no longer be relied upon. KLA-Tencor intends to file its restated financial results and Annual Report on Form 10-K as quickly as practicable.
KLA-Tencor does not anticipate that the restatement will have any impact on the Company's historical revenues. Any stock-based compensation charges incurred as a result of the restatement would have the effect of decreasing reported income or increasing reported loss from operations, and decreasing reported net income or increasing reported net loss, and decreasing reported retained earnings amounts contained in the Company's historical financial statements for the affected periods.
: Statements in this press release regarding KLA-Tencor's expected restatement of historical financial statements are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to, the final conclusions of the Board of Directors, the Special Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Company's independent public accountants concerning matters related to the company's stock option grants.

Exhibit 99.2
TO: KLA-TENCOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BOARD MEMBERS
FROM: RICK WALLACE
RE: SARBANES-OXLEY BLACKOUT PERIOD
DATED: SEPTEMBER 28, 2006
As you may already know, the Company determined yesterday that its financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated as a result of improper accounting for option grants made to officers and employees. This determination has substantial implications for the Company's various equity incentive programs and your ability to engage in transactions involving the Company's common stock. You are currently under a Company-imposed black-out on your ability to trade in the Company's common stock in open-market transactions, but as a result of the impact which the restatement decision will have upon certain employee stock programs, including the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan, you will now also be subject to the restrictions of Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which prohibit you from purchasing selling, acquiring or transferring any equity securities of the Company, to the extent those securities were acquired in connection with your service as an executive officer or Board member.
Shares of the Company's common stock can only be issued under the Company's equity incentive programs pursuant to an effective registration statement under the federal securities laws. The Company currently has S-8 registration statements on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering the shares of common stock issuable under those programs. However, the S-8 registration statements incorporate historical financial statements for one or more fiscal years which are likely to be restated because of the improper accounting of employee stock options during those years. For that reason, participation in the various equity incentive programs covered by those S-8 registration statements must be suspended. The suspension period began at 9:00AM Pacific Time today, September 28, 2006, and will continue until 9:00 AM Pacific Time of the day immediately following the day on which the restated financial statements are filed with the SEC.
Your participation in the Company's equity incentive plans will accordingly be affected as follows:
     During the suspension period, the executive officers will continue to be precluded from directing the investment of their 401(k) plan contributions into shares of the Company's common stock or from moving their existing account balance under the plan into the Company common stock fund. However, all other participants in the 401(k) plan will now be subject to the same restrictions while the suspension period remains in effect. In addition, to the extent one or more executive officers may have their 401(k) account currently
4
01(k)
Plan:
 
invested in the Company common stock fund, they will not be allowed during the suspension period to liquidate that investment and move it into another available investment fund.
     No further exercises of outstanding options, including same-day exercise and sale transactions, can be effected during the suspension period.
Stock Option Plans:
      No further contributions can be made to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the suspension period. If you are currently a participant in the ESPP, you may request a refund of any contributions you have made to date for the current purchase period. However if you do withdraw those contributions, then you would immediately cease participation in the ESPP and could not rejoin the plan until the next scheduled entry date, at which time a new maximum purchase price would be set for you. Should you leave your existing contributions in the plan, then those contributions would be applied to the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock at the end of the current purchase period, provided the S-8 registration statement is in effect at that time; otherwise, the purchase date will have to be deferred until the S-8 is reactivated. You would continue to have the right to request a refund of your existing contributions during the deferral period.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan:
     No allocations of the Company's common stock may be made during the suspension period to the accounts of the executive officers who participate in this non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
Excess Profit Stock Plan:
As a result of the foregoing blackout period under the 401(k) Plan, executive officers and Board members will be prohibited pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring any shares of the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the Company's common stock (such as put or call options or pre-paid variable forward sale contracts) during the blackout period in effect under the 401(k) plan. The prohibition covers any acquisition of the Company's common stock or derivative security in connection with the covered individual's service or employment with the Company (e.g., an option grant, restricted stock unit award or Excess Profit Stock Plan allocation) or any sale of the Company's common stock which the executive officer or Board member acquired in connection with his or her service in such capacity (e.g., through the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units). However, the prohibition would not extend to any transactions effected pursuant to certain pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 plans.
Because of the complexity of the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition, executive officers and Board members are strongly advised not to engage in any transactions involving the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the stock during the suspension period.
 
If you have any questions concerning the suspension period or the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition on transactions involving the Company's common stock or any related derivative security, please contact Larry Gross at the Company's headquarters at 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, CA 95134 or by telephoning him at 408-875-3000.
The Company can provide no assurances as to when the necessary restatements will be completed and filed with the SEC, since completion of those restatements are not entirely within the Company's control. However, the Company will notify you promptly when the S-8 registration statements are re-activated and the Sarbanes-Oxley blackout period ends.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The disclosure set forth in Item 4.02 below is incorporated by reference.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
A Special Committee of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") has delivered a report to the Board of Directors, which concluded that incorrect measurement dates were used for certain stock option grants made principally during the period from July 1, 1997 through July 30, 2002. The Board of Directors of the Company has not concluded its evaluation of the factors that led to the use of incorrect measurement dates of stock options. The Board of Directors has concluded that the Company will need to restate certain of its historical financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The Company has not determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impacts, the impact on internal control over financial reporting, or which specific periods may require restatement. However, the effects on previously reported financial statements are expected to be material. The Special Committee and the Board of Directors will continue to be actively involved in reviewing information and determining the appropriate actions to be taken by the Company with respect to this matter.
Accordingly, on September 27, 2006, the Board of Directors concluded that financial statements and all earnings and press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, should no longer be relied upon, including the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1998 through 2005, the interim periods contained therein, and the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006. The Company's management and the Special Committee have discussed this matter with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company issued a press release concerning this matter on September 28, 2006, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
     On September 27, 2006, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") determined that its historical financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated as a result of improper accounting for option grants made to officers and employees. The specific fiscal years which will need to be restated has yet been determined. However, the Company has decided to suspend temporarily employee participation in several equity incentive programs because the S-8 registration statements covering the shares of common stock issuable under those programs incorporate one or more financial statements that will likely have to be restated. As part of such suspension, participants in the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") will be subject to a blackout period during which they will be precluded from acquiring shares of the Company's common stock under that plan.
     The blackout period began at 7:00 AM Pacific Time on September 28, 2006 and is currently anticipated to end at 7:00 AM Pacific Time on the day immediately following the day on which the restated financial statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). However, for the Company's executive officers and Board Members, the blackout period will continue until 7:00 AM on the third business day following the date the restatements are filed. During the applicable blackout period, participants in the 401(k) plan will be precluded from directing the investment of their plan contributions into shares of the Company's common stock or from moving their existing account balance under the plan into the Company common stock fund. In addition, the executive officers will not be allowed during the blackout period to move their existing 401(k) plan account balances out of any Company common stock in which those accounts may now be invested. The Company gave notice of the blackout period to its executive officers and Board members on September 29, 2006. The Company was not able to provide any advance notice because the imposition of the blackout period was due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. A copy of the blackout notice is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
     As a result of the blackout period under the 401(k) Plan, executive officers and Board members will be prohibited pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring any shares of the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the Company's common stock, while that blackout period remains in effect. The prohibition covers any acquisition of the Company's common stock or related derivative security in connection with the covered individual's service or employment with the Company (e.g., an option grant or restricted stock or restricted stock unit award) or any sale of the Company's common stock which the executive officer or Board member acquired in connection with his or her service in such capacity (e.g., through the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units). However, the prohibition would not extend to any transactions effected pursuant to certain pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 plans.
     Any questions concerning the blackout period or the transactions affected by the blackout period are to be addressed to Jeff Hall, the Company's Chief Financial Officer at the Company's headquarters at 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, California 95134 or by telephoning him at (408) 875-3000.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     In conjunction with its determination that its financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated, the Company has notified participants in its 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2000 Nonstatutory Plan, the Restated 1982 Stock Option Plan, as amended, the 1993 Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1990 Stock Option Plan, the 1998 Outside Director Option Plan, the Excess Profit Stock Plan and the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that during a designated suspension period, they will not be able to exercise their outstanding stock options, make contributions to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan or purchase shares of common stock under such plan, or receive allocations of Company common stock under the Excess Profit Stock Plan.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, Calif., September 28, 2006  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that it will restate previously issued financial statements to correct the Company's past accounting for stock options. Based on a report received from a Special Committee of the Board of Directors, the Board concluded that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants were used for financial accounting purposes, principally during the periods July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002. As a result, the Company will be required to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to those past stock option grants.
The Company has not determined the exact amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which specific reporting periods may require restatement. Accordingly, the Company is filing a Form 8-K today stating that the financial statements and all earnings and press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, should no longer be relied upon. KLA-Tencor intends to file its restated financial results and Annual Report on Form 10-K as quickly as practicable.
KLA-Tencor does not anticipate that the restatement will have any impact on the Company's historical revenues. Any stock-based compensation charges incurred as a result of the restatement would have the effect of decreasing reported income or increasing reported loss from operations, and decreasing reported net income or increasing reported net loss, and decreasing reported retained earnings amounts contained in the Company's historical financial statements for the affected periods.
: Statements in this press release regarding KLA-Tencor's expected restatement of historical financial statements are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to, the final conclusions of the Board of Directors, the Special Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Company's independent public accountants concerning matters related to the company's stock option grants.

Exhibit 99.2
TO: KLA-TENCOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BOARD MEMBERS
FROM: RICK WALLACE
RE: SARBANES-OXLEY BLACKOUT PERIOD
DATED: SEPTEMBER 28, 2006
As you may already know, the Company determined yesterday that its financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years will have to be restated as a result of improper accounting for option grants made to officers and employees. This determination has substantial implications for the Company's various equity incentive programs and your ability to engage in transactions involving the Company's common stock. You are currently under a Company-imposed black-out on your ability to trade in the Company's common stock in open-market transactions, but as a result of the impact which the restatement decision will have upon certain employee stock programs, including the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan, you will now also be subject to the restrictions of Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which prohibit you from purchasing selling, acquiring or transferring any equity securities of the Company, to the extent those securities were acquired in connection with your service as an executive officer or Board member.
Shares of the Company's common stock can only be issued under the Company's equity incentive programs pursuant to an effective registration statement under the federal securities laws. The Company currently has S-8 registration statements on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering the shares of common stock issuable under those programs. However, the S-8 registration statements incorporate historical financial statements for one or more fiscal years which are likely to be restated because of the improper accounting of employee stock options during those years. For that reason, participation in the various equity incentive programs covered by those S-8 registration statements must be suspended. The suspension period began at 9:00AM Pacific Time today, September 28, 2006, and will continue until 9:00 AM Pacific Time of the day immediately following the day on which the restated financial statements are filed with the SEC.
Your participation in the Company's equity incentive plans will accordingly be affected as follows:
     During the suspension period, the executive officers will continue to be precluded from directing the investment of their 401(k) plan contributions into shares of the Company's common stock or from moving their existing account balance under the plan into the Company common stock fund. However, all other participants in the 401(k) plan will now be subject to the same restrictions while the suspension period remains in effect. In addition, to the extent one or more executive officers may have their 401(k) account currently
4
01(k)
Plan:
 
invested in the Company common stock fund, they will not be allowed during the suspension period to liquidate that investment and move it into another available investment fund.
     No further exercises of outstanding options, including same-day exercise and sale transactions, can be effected during the suspension period.
Stock Option Plans:
      No further contributions can be made to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the suspension period. If you are currently a participant in the ESPP, you may request a refund of any contributions you have made to date for the current purchase period. However if you do withdraw those contributions, then you would immediately cease participation in the ESPP and could not rejoin the plan until the next scheduled entry date, at which time a new maximum purchase price would be set for you. Should you leave your existing contributions in the plan, then those contributions would be applied to the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock at the end of the current purchase period, provided the S-8 registration statement is in effect at that time; otherwise, the purchase date will have to be deferred until the S-8 is reactivated. You would continue to have the right to request a refund of your existing contributions during the deferral period.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan:
     No allocations of the Company's common stock may be made during the suspension period to the accounts of the executive officers who participate in this non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
Excess Profit Stock Plan:
As a result of the foregoing blackout period under the 401(k) Plan, executive officers and Board members will be prohibited pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring any shares of the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the Company's common stock (such as put or call options or pre-paid variable forward sale contracts) during the blackout period in effect under the 401(k) plan. The prohibition covers any acquisition of the Company's common stock or derivative security in connection with the covered individual's service or employment with the Company (e.g., an option grant, restricted stock unit award or Excess Profit Stock Plan allocation) or any sale of the Company's common stock which the executive officer or Board member acquired in connection with his or her service in such capacity (e.g., through the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units). However, the prohibition would not extend to any transactions effected pursuant to certain pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 plans.
Because of the complexity of the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition, executive officers and Board members are strongly advised not to engage in any transactions involving the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the stock during the suspension period.
 
If you have any questions concerning the suspension period or the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition on transactions involving the Company's common stock or any related derivative security, please contact Larry Gross at the Company's headquarters at 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, CA 95134 or by telephoning him at 408-875-3000.
The Company can provide no assurances as to when the necessary restatements will be completed and filed with the SEC, since completion of those restatements are not entirely within the Company's control. However, the Company will notify you promptly when the S-8 registration statements are re-activated and the Sarbanes-Oxley blackout period ends.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b)
On October 16, 2006, as a result of the Special Committee investigation (further disclosed in Item 8.01 below) of the historical stock option practices of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company"), the Company terminated, effective immediately, all aspects of its employment relationship with Kenneth L. Schroeder and any and all employment and/or service agreements between Mr. Schroeder and the Company. The Company intends to cancel all outstanding stock options held by Mr. Schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. Mr. Schroeder was President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company from 1991 to 1999 and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company from 1999 to 2005.
Also on October 16, 2006, the Company's General Counsel, Stuart J. Nichols, resigned, effective immediately. Mr. Nichols had been Vice President and General Counsel of the Company since 2000. The Company intends to re-price all outstanding retroactively priced stock options held by Mr. Nichols; the exercise price of each re-priced option will be increased to the fair market value on the corrected measurement date.
A copy of the Company's news release issued on October 16, 2006 in connection with the foregoing, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.
Later on October 16, 2006, Kenneth Levy, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, retired as a Director and employee, effective immediately, and was named Chairman Emeritus by the Board of Directors. As of that date, by mutual agreement, Mr. Levy's employment with the Company immediately ceased, and any and all employment or service contracts between Mr. Levy and the Company immediately terminated, with each party having no further monetary or other obligations thereunder. The Company intends to re-price all outstanding retroactively priced stock options held by Mr. Levy; the exercise price of each re-priced option will be increased to the fair market value on the corrected measurement date. Mr. Levy was a member of the Board of Directors of the Company since 1975, Chairman of the Board since 1999, and Chief Executive Officer from 1975 to 1997 and from mid 1998 to mid 1999.
Edward W. Barnholt was appointed to succeed Mr. Levy as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and will serve in a non-executive capacity. Mr. Barnholt is the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Agilent Technologies, and joined the Company's Board of Directors in 1995.
A copy of the Company's news release issued on October 17, 2006 in connection with the foregoing, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.
Table of Contents
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On October 16, 2006, the Company announced that the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has substantially completed its investigation of the Company's historical stock option practices. The Company now expects that the total additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expenses will not exceed $400 million.
     Based on the Special Committee's investigation, the Board of Directors concluded that there was no involvement in the improper stock option practices by any current members of Company management, including Richard P. Wallace, John H. Kispert and Jeffrey L. Hall, who became Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, in early 2006. Although the Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Kispert was not involved in the improper stock option practices, based on the Special Committee's recommendation, his outstanding retroactively priced options will be re-priced because he served as Chief Financial Officer during part of the period in question; the exercise price of each re-priced option will be increased to the fair market value on the corrected measurement date.
     While the Company is evaluating whether the factors that led to the restatement constituted a material weakness as of June 30, 2006, the Company believes that it has in place the necessary internal controls to ensure proper accounting for stock options going forward.
     The Special Committee will now concentrate its efforts on assisting the Company's management with the restatement of the Company's affected financial statements. The restatement process is well underway, and the Company will continue to work diligently to determine the exact amount of additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expenses, the resulting accounting and tax impact, and the specific prior periods requiring restatement, and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as well as other required reports, as soon as practicable.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN JOSE, California, October 16, 2006  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced that the Special Committee investigation of the Company's historical stock option practices has been substantially completed. As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors concluded that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants were used for financial accounting purposes, principally during the period July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002, and as a result, the Company will restate its financial statements to correct the accounting for retroactively priced stock options. The Company now anticipates that the total additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expenses will not exceed $400 million.
As a result of the investigation, the Company has terminated all aspects of its employment relationship with Kenneth L. Schroeder, effective immediately.

Exhibit 99.1
October 16, 2006
Mr. Kenneth Levy
Dear Ken:
This Separation Agreement and General Release ("Agreement") confirms the terms of your retirement from KLA-Tencor Corporation ("KLA"). You retired as a Chairman of the Board, director, officer and employee of KLA (and all applicable subsidiaries and affiliates of KLA) as of October 16, 2006, and you were named Chairman Emeritus by the Board. You acknowledge that, as of the date of your retirement, you have been paid all compensation owed to you as of that date.
If you sign this Agreement, and provided you do not exercise your right of revocation, the consideration provided herein will be made available to you. Please read the following carefully as it sets forth the terms of our separation agreement and contains a release of claims. If you agree to its terms after considering them as provided in this Agreement, you are asked to sign it not later than November 6, 2006, and it will be binding upon you.
I. BENEFITS UPON SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT
On or about seven (7) calendar days after your execution of this Agreement, provided you do not exercise your right of revocation and provided all applicable conditions of this Agreement are met, you will be paid a lump sum amount equal to $37,500, which is 25% of your current base salary ($150,000 per year), less required deductions. This payment will be made to you in accordance with KLA's normal payroll practices for salaried employees. With the exception of the payment of your remaining salary due through the date of your retirement and the reimbursements described in the next paragraph, you will not be eligible for any additional payment under any other agreement or any severance or other plan, policy or program.
On or about seven (7) calendar days after your execution of this Agreement, provided you do not exercise your right of revocation and provided all applicable conditions of this Agreement are met, you will be entitled to receive the following until you reach age 70: (a) reimbursement for the costs of an executive office (not on Company premises) and related amenities, provided that such reimbursement will not exceed $50,000 per year; and (b) the full-time services of your current administrative assistant (or her replacement), who will be an employee of the Company, provided that the fully-loaded cost for such assistant does not exceed $100,000 per year.
II. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRACT
As set forth above, you retired as a director, officer and employee of KLA on October 16, 2006. As of that date, by mutual agreement your employment with KLA immediately ceased, and any
 
Mr. Kenneth Levy October 16, 2006 Page 2
and all employment or service contracts between you and KLA (or any of its predecessors or affiliates) immediately terminated, with each party having no further monetary or other obligations thereunder.
III. RELEASE OF CLAIMS
In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement as provided for above, you release KLA, any affiliated companies, and the current and former officers, directors, agents, attorneys, and employees and assigns of KLA and any affiliated companies, from any and all claims up through the date of the execution of this Agreement. The claims subject to this release include, but are not limited to, those related to your roles as director, officer and employee of KLA and the termination thereof and those related to any employment or service contract between you and KLA (or any of its predecessors or affiliates) and the termination thereof. All such claims (whether known or unknown) are barred without regard to whether those claims are based on any alleged breach of a duty arising in statute, contract, or tort. This expressly includes waiver and release of any rights and claims arising under any and all laws, rules, regulations, or ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Family and Medial Leave Act; the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; and any similar law of any other state or governmental entity. The foregoing release shall not apply to (1) claims for indemnification arising under or with respect to Labor Code Section 2802, other provisions of law, KLA's bylaws, or your indemnification agreement with KLA, (2) your right to continue your health insurance benefits under COBRA, (3) your rights under this Agreement, (4) your rights to vested benefits under the terms of any KLA benefit plan, and (5) any claims relating to the historical stock option practices of KLA during your affiliation with KLA (provided that this exclusion does not cover compensation and valuation claims by you relating to stock options and other equity awards granted to you or exercised by you, which are the subject of Section V hereof).
The parties agree to apply California law in interpreting this Agreement. Accordingly, you further waive any rights under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any similar state statute. Section 1542 states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known to him, must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
IV. COOPERATION
Given your prior long-standing position as a director, officer and employee of KLA, you agree that you will cooperate with KLA in connection with any internal investigation, and the defense or prosecution of any claim that may be made against or by KLA, or in connection with any ongoing or future investigation or dispute or claim of any kind involving KLA, including any proceeding, civil or criminal, before any arbitral, administrative, judicial, legislative, or other body or agency. This cooperation is limited to providing to KLA any documents or other
 
Mr. Kenneth Levy October 16, 2006 Page 3
tangible information in your possession or control, and executing and delivering any documents that may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
In addition, you will provide reasonable transition assistance to KLA's management for up to six (6) months after the date of your resignation.
V. STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
You acknowledge that your unvested KLA stock options and restricted stock units ceased vesting in connection with your retirement, and that your unvested stock options and restricted stock units were cancelled as of the date of your retirement. The exercise price of all of your vested, unexercised stock options which KLA determines were retroactively priced will be increased to the fair market value on the corrected measurement dates used for financial accounting purposes (such values and dates to be determined in connection with KLA's pending restatement of financial statements). The exercise period for each of your vested, unexercised stock options will be extended to the later of the current post-employment exercise period in effect for such vested option, and the end of the 30-day period measured from the first day the options can be exercised in compliance with applicable Federal securities laws KLA's S-8 registration statements are re-activated); it being specifically understood and agreed that (a) KLA shall take no action to frustrate your ability to exercise such options and that such options shall in no event be terminated or expire until you have had at least 30 days in which to exercise such options and sell the underlying shares without impediment, and (b) notwithstanding KLA's compliance with the foregoing clause (a), your ability to exercise such options at that time may be affected by legal limitations, requirements or restrictions arising from KLA's legal situation in relation to stock options..
(e.g.,
VI. MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement contains the entire understanding regarding the subjects addressed herein, including but not limited to your eligibility for and the payment of severance benefits, and supersedes any or all prior representations and agreements regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. However, this Agreement does not modify, amend or supersede written KLA agreements that are consistent with enforceable provisions of this Agreement such as KLA's Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement and your obligation to repay KLA loan(s), if any. Once effective and enforceable, this Agreement can be changed only by another written agreement signed by you and each of the persons (or their designees) who sign below.
VII. OTHER RIGHTS
You also understand and acknowledge that you:
 
Mr. Kenneth Levy October 16, 2006 Page 4
In understanding the terms of this Agreement and your rights, you are advised to consult with an attorney of your choice prior to executing it.

VIII. EXPIRATION OF OFFER  DELIVERY OF ACCEPTANCE

You understand that signing this Agreement, and accepting the payments and benefits it provides, represents full satisfaction of all other contractual or plan-based severance payments and/or benefits from KLA or assumed by KLA.
IX. ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT

The parties further agree that the arbitrator shall not be empowered to add to, subtract from, or modify, alter or amend the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement to arbitrate shall be interpreted in a manner so as to ensure its enforceability under applicable state or federal law. The Company will pay the costs of arbitration, and otherwise each party will pay their own legal fees and expenses.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
KLA-Tencor Corporation
I UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE ABOVE TERMS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS.

 
Exhibit 99.2
          THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 (the "Amendment") to the SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE dated October 16, 2006 made by and between KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company"), and Kenneth Levy, (hereinafter "Executive") shall be effective as of October 16, 2006 (the "Effective Date").
          WHEREAS, the Executive is currently a party to the Separation Agreement and General Release with the Company dated October 16, 2006 (the "Agreement");
          WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend the terms and conditions of the Agreement to conform those terms to the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code;
          NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and Executive, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein, agree as follows:
          Section I of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following new section:
          Provided you do not exercise your right of revocation after your execution of this Agreement and provided all applicable conditions of this Agreement are met, you will be paid a lump sum amount equal to $37,500, which is 25% of your current base salary ($150,000 per year), less required deductions on April 17, 2007 (six months after the date of your separation from service with the Company) or as soon as practicable thereafter. Should you die before April 17, 2007, the payment will be made to your estate within 30 days after your death. Payment will be made to you in accordance with KLA's normal payroll practices for salaried employees. With the exception of the payment of your remaining salary due through the date of your retirement and the reimbursements described in the next paragraph, you will not be eligible for any additional payment under any other agreement or any severance or other plan, policy or program.
          On or about seven (7) calendar days after the execution of this Agreement, provided you do not exercise your right of revocation and provided all applicable conditions of this Agreement are met, you will be entitled to receive the following until you reach age 70: (a) reimbursement for the costs of an executive office (not on Company premises) and related amenities, provided that such reimbursement will not exceed $50,000 per year; and (b) full-time services of your current administrative assistant (or her replacement), who will be an employee of the Company, provided that the fully-loaded cost for such assistant does not exceed $100,000 per year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any costs you incur for your executive office for the period beginning on October 16, 2006 and ending on April 16, 2007 (the "409A Period") will not be reimbursed to you until April 17, 2007 or as soon as practicable thereafter. In addition, during the 409A Period, you will reimburse the Company on a monthly basis beginning November 16, 2006 and ending April 16, 2007 for the cost of providing you with the services of your current administrative assistant (or her replacement), and, for any period of time during the 409A Period you maintain an executive office on Company premises rather than offsite, for the costs of the
 
executive office on Company premises. However, on April 17, 2007 or as soon as practicable thereafter, you will receive a lump sum payment in the amount of those reimbursements made to the Company. Should you die before April 17, 2007, any reimbursements or payments due you under this paragraph will be made to your estate within 30 days after your death.
          Except for the foregoing amendment to the Agreement, no other terms or conditions of your Agreement have been modified as a result of this Amendment, and those other terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect.
          This amendment does not restart the 21 day consideration period in the Agreement and is effective when you sign it.
          Please attach a copy of this Amendment to your Agreement so that you will have a complete record of all the terms applicable to your employment with the Company.

Item 3.01      Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
          As expected, the Company was unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 by the required filing date of November 14, 2006, because the Company has not yet completed the restatement of its financial statements required due to the retroactive pricing of certain stock options. As a result, the Company received an Additional Nasdaq Staff Determination notice on November 14, 2006 indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and that this non-compliance will serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The notice, which the Company expected, was issued in accordance with standard Nasdaq procedures. The Company has already appealed the previous Nasdaq Staff Determination and appeared in a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel on October 26, 2006. No decision has yet been rendered by the Panel. Pending the Panel's decision, the Company's shares will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
          A copy of the Company's news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
          This Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities law. Such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Those statements that make reference to expectations, predictions, beliefs and assumptions should be considered forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, those associated with the expected closing time for the proposed merger and the obtaining of clearance from German antitrust authorities. These statements involve risks and uncertainties including those associated with delays in obtaining, or adverse conditions contained in, the German antitrust authorities' regulatory approvals; failure to consummate or delays in consummating the proposed merger for other reasons; changes in laws or regulations; and other similar factors. Further information on potential factors that could affect KLA-Tencor's or ADE's respective businesses is contained in their reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including their respective Form 10-Q's. KLA-Tencor and ADE are under no obligation to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or alter their respective forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) As previously announced, the Company has conducted an extensive examination of its historical stock option grant practices under its various equity incentive plans and has determined that certain outstanding options have exercise prices below the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the actual date on which those particular options were granted. The exercise prices for those options were instead set at the fair market value of the common stock on an earlier date when the fair market value was lower. These retroactively-priced options, to the extent they were not vested as of December 31, 2004, are likely to be subject to taxation under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A unless the exercise price is increased to the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock on the actual grant date. For individuals who were executive officers of the Company subject to the reporting requirements and trading restrictions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 at the time such options were granted, the requisite change must be effected by December 31, 2006.
     Accordingly, during the three-day period from December 26, 2006 to December 28, 2006, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Stock Option Amendment and Special Bonus Agreement (an "Agreement") with each of the following individuals in the Company's employ:
     Mr. Wallace is currently an executive officer of the Company and signed the Agreement on December 28, 2006. Messrs. Richardson and Fortino were executive officers of the Company when they received the options in question, but they do not have such executive officer status at present.
     The Agreements increased the per share exercise price in effect for the shares of the Company's common stock purchasable under the portion of each retroactively-priced option potentially subject to Section 409A to the fair market value per share of such common stock on the actual grant date of that option. The specific increases to the retroactively-priced options held by Mr. Wallace may be summarized as follows:
Table of Contents
     For Mr. Richardson, the increase in exercise prices affected 11,000 option shares in total. The aggregate dollar amount of that increase was $195,812.50. For Mr. Fortino, the increase affected 6,375 option shares in total and was $104,013.75 in the aggregate.
     Except for the increases to the exercise prices per share for the options described above, no other terms or provisions of the original option agreements for those options have been modified.
     As part of their Agreements, Messrs. Wallace, Richardson and Fortino will each receive a special cash bonus from the Company equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for their Section 409A-covered options, as that aggregate increase is indicated above for each of them. The payment will be made in January 2008, subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
(a) On February 27, 2007, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") commenced a formal tender offer to its employees that will allow them to tender for amendment or replacement certain outstanding options under the Company's Restated 1982 Stock Option Plan, 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan and 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. The options subject to the offer have been determined, as a result of a lengthy investigation of the Company's past option grant practices, to have exercise prices based on the fair market value per share of its common stock on a date earlier than the actual dates on which those options were granted. As a result, those options have exercise prices below the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code provides that options granted with a below-market exercise price, to the extent unvested as of December 31, 2004, will be subject to adverse income taxation, unless certain remedial action is taken before those options are exercised. The offer is designed to allow employees the opportunity to avoid those tax consequences by offering to amend or replace each of their Section 409A-covered options. If such an option is tendered for amendment pursuant to the offer, then the exercise price of that option will, on the next business day following the expiration date of the offer, be adjusted to the lower of (i) the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock on the date on which that option was actually granted or (ii) the closing selling price per share of its common stock on the date on which the option is amended pursuant to the offer (the "Adjusted Exercise Price").
Employees whose options are amended in accordance with the terms of the offer will become eligible to receive a special cash bonus. The amount of the cash bonus payable with respect to each amended option will be determined by multiplying (i) the amount by which the Adjusted Exercise Price exceeds the exercise price currently in effect for that option by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock purchasable under that option at the Adjusted Exercise Price. The cash bonus will be paid on January 2, 2008.
However, if the Adjusted Exercise Price determined for any tendered option would be the same or lower than the exercise price per share currently in effect for that option, then that option will, on the next business day following the expiration of the offer, be canceled and immediately replaced with a new option that is exactly the same as the canceled option, including the same exercise price per share, vesting schedule and expiration date, but with a new grant date. Such cancellation and re-grant is necessary to evidence the remedial action required under Section 409A with respect to an option whose current exercise price is not increased. No cash bonus will be paid with respect to such a regranted option because there would be no change to the exercise price.
Options to purchase 5,139,344 shares of the Company's common stock are eligible for tender pursuant to the offer. The aggregate cash bonus payable pursuant to the offer will be not be more than approximately $21,500,000, assuming that all eligible option are tendered and the exercise price of each such tendered option is increased to the fair market value per share on the actual grant date of that option.
(b) In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company has nominated Mr. Robert M. Calderoni for election as a Class I Director at the next Annual Meeting of its stockholders, scheduled for March 29, 2007. Mr. Calderoni has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ariba, Inc. ("Ariba"), since July 2003 and as Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Ariba since 2001. From 2001 to 2004, Mr. Calderoni also served as Ariba's President and before that as the Ariba's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. From 1997 to 2001, he served as Chief Financial Officer at Avery Dennison Corporation.
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

As a result of the Special Committee investigation of the Company's historical stock option practices, in the fall of 2006, the Board of Directors suspended use of any type of stock option committee (including a stock option committee composed of one or more executives) and delegated sole authority for granting stock options and restricted stock awards to the full Compensation Committee, subject to ratification by the Board of Directors, with the grant date being the date of the Compensation Committee approval and with the option exercise price or restricted stock valuation price equal to the closing market price on the grant date. The Board of Directors may in the future evaluate the possibility of again using a stock option committee, and, if so, the Company will implement additional controls designed to assure that the stock option committee is properly constituted and acts within the scope of its delegated authority.
In February 2007, the Compensation Committee approved, and the Board of Directors ratified, a new policy regarding equity award grant procedures. The new policy incorporates the following elements (many of which were existing practices):

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 9, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of KLA-Tencor Corporation ("KLA-Tencor") appointed Kevin J. Kennedy to serve as a director of KLA-Tencor. Mr. Kennedy has been Chief Executive Officer of JDS Uniphase Corporation since September 2003 and a member of its board of directors since November 2001. He served as Chief Operating Officer of Openwave Systems, Inc. from 2002 to 2003 and prior to that, spent seven years at Cisco Systems, Inc., most recently as a Senior Vice President in Cisco's Software Technologies Division. Mr. Kennedy also worked at Bell Laboratories, a subsidiary of AT&T Inc., for 17 years in a series of management and technical positions. An acknowledged expert in data and computational science, as well as technology management, during his career Kennedy has been an adjunct professor at Rutgers University and served as a congressional fellow to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
On May 9, 2007, the Board appointed John Trevor Dickson to serve as a director of KLA-Tencor. Mr. Dickson was Chief Executive Officer of Agere Systems Inc. from 2000 to 2005 and was Chief Executive Officer and Corporate Executive Vice President of AT&T/Lucent Technologies' Microelectronics and Communications Technologies Group from 1993 to 2000. Earlier, he worked for Plessey Semiconductor, Ltd., Texas Instruments Incorporated, International Computers, Ltd., LSI Logic Corp. and Shographics, Inc. in a variety of management positions. Mr. Dickson received his Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering, and a Diploma, Business Studies, from the University of Sheffield. He currently sits on the board of directors of Frontier Silicon, Ltd. (private), Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., and National Semiconductor Corp.
Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson are compensated for their services as directors consistent with that of KLA-Tencor's other non-employee directors. All compensation for the initial year that Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson are directors shall be prorated, as appropriate, to reflect the portion of the year elapsed since the date of the last annual stockholders meeting.
Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson shall receive equity compensation pursuant to KLA-Tencor's 1998 Outside Director Plan and 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, both of which were approved by stockholders. Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson will each automatically be granted a series of non-statutory stock options each year to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate (the "Annual Option Grant"). Each Annual Option Grant will be provided through an automatic 1,250-share option grant each quarter, approximately two business days following the Company's earnings release for the prior fiscal quarter. The term of each option granted under the 1998 Director Plan may not exceed 10 years. The 1998 Director Plan provides that the exercise price shall be equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of the option. Options granted under the 1998 Director Plan are fully vested and immediately exercisable upon grant.
At each annual stockholders meeting, Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson will be awarded restricted stock units covering shares of KLA-Tencor's Common Stock with an aggregate fair market value of $50,000 based on the market price of KLA-Tencor's Common Stock at the time of the award. As Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson did not join the Board on the date of an annual stockholders meeting, their first restricted stock unit awards were granted on May 9, 2007, the first regular Board meeting they attended, and were prorated, as noted above, to take into account the period of time that has lapsed since the date of the last annual stockholders meeting.
Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson, for their services as directors, shall each also receive an annual fee of $40,000, paid quarterly, and meeting fees of $2,500 for each Board meeting attended in person and $1,250 for each Board meeting attended by telephone conference call. Messrs. Kennedy and Dickson shall also be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in attending Board meetings.
A copy of the press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Dickson is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
In meetings held on August 8 and August 13, 2007, the independent members of the Board of Directors (the "Independent Directors") of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") established the Company performance goals which are to be in effect for the 2008 fiscal year under the Company's Performance Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), an incentive bonus plan administered in conformity with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The performance goals are tied to the Company's profit from operations and revenue growth for the 2008 fiscal year. The Independent Directors also approved the bonus potential for each of the Company's executive officers at threshold, target and maximum levels of Company performance for the 2008 fiscal year. Following the close of the 2008 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (or, in the case of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Independent Directors) will determine the actual bonus amount for each executive officer participating in the Plan based on the actual levels at which the performance goals for that year are attained. The Compensation Committee or the Independent Directors (as applicable) will have the discretion to adjust the actual bonus amount that would otherwise be due upon the attainment of the performance goals, based on their assessment of the officer's performance for the 2008 fiscal year. The actual bonus amounts (if any) will be paid within ninety days after the close of such year.
The following executive officers will participate in the Plan for the 2008 fiscal year, with bonus potentials at the following threshold (i.e., the minimum amount payable if the initial performance threshold is satisfied), target and maximum levels:
 
The actual bonus award (if any) may be higher or lower depending upon the actual level at which the performance goals for the 2008 fiscal year are attained, but no executive officer will receive a bonus award under the Plan in excess of the maximum dollar award indicated for him above, and no executive officer will receive any bonus award under the Plan if the threshold level of Company performance is not attained.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(b) Effective November 9, 2007, as previously disclosed in the Proxy Statement filed by KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 11, 2007, Jorge L. Titinger, the Company's former Senior Vice President, Global Operations and Corporate Support Groups, ceased to be an employee of the Company. In connection with his cessation of employment, certain of his outstanding stock options to acquire shares of the Company's common stock were amended in the manner discussed below.
(e) As previously disclosed, the Company has undergone an examination of its historical stock option practices by the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and, as a result, discovered that certain of the Company's stock options, primarily those granted from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002, had been retroactively priced for all employees who received those grants. This means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option, but instead was set at a lower market price on an earlier date. These retroactively priced options, to the extent they were not vested as of December 31, 2004, are likely to be subject to adverse taxation under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A unless the exercise price is increased to the lower of (i) the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock on the actual grant date or (ii) the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock on the date the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved the increased exercise price. Jeffrey L. Hall and Mr. Titinger each currently hold retroactively priced options which were granted to them prior to their becoming executive officers of the Company. However, each of them was such an executive officer at the time the Company commenced the offer to its employees to amend or replace certain retroactively priced stock options in its Schedule TO filed with the SEC on February 27, 2007 (the "409A Tender Offer"). As a result, they were not eligible to participate in the 409A Tender Offer, and the requisite changes under Section 409A to their stock options must be effected by December 31, 2007.
Accordingly, on November 6, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved a Stock Option Amendment and Special Bonus Agreement (an "Agreement") with each of Messrs. Hall and Titinger, in substantially the form of the agreement attached as Exhibit 99.1. The terms of the Agreements, which were both executed on November 8, 2007, are the same as those in effect for the Company's employees who participated in the 409A Tender Offer and increased the exercise prices of their Section 409A-covered options in accordance with the formula described above.
Mr. Hall, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, is currently an executive officer of the Company. Mr. Titinger does not have executive officer status at present. The specific increases to the retroactively priced options held by Messrs. Hall and Titinger pursuant to the Agreements are summarized as follows:
 
Except for the increases to the exercise prices per share for the options described above, no other terms or provisions of the original option agreements for those options have been modified.
As part of their Agreements, Messrs. Hall and Titinger will each receive a special cash bonus from the Company equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for their Section 409A-covered options, as that aggregate increase is indicated above for each of them.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, any such stockholder nomination shall be made only pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation setting forth such stockholder's intent to make a nomination or nominations. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal offices of the Corporation not later than the date on which stockholder proposals to be included in the proxy statement with respect to any annual or special meeting must be received by the Corporation under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder.
Each such notice by a stockholder shall set forth: (a) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's stock register, of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between

The Corporation or any nominating committee designated by the Board of Directors may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation or such committee to determine the qualification of such nominee for election as a director of the Corporation.
In the event that a person is validly designated as a nominee in accordance with this Section 11 and shall thereafter become unable or unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or the stockholder who proposed such nominee as the case may be, may designate a substitute nominee; provided, however, that (i) in the case of the persons nominated by a stockholder, such a substitution may only be made if a written notice to the Secretary setting forth such information regarding such substitute nominee as would have been required to be delivered to the Secretary pursuant to this Section 11 had such substitute nominee been initially proposed as a nominee is received by the Corporation at its principal executive offices not less than thirty (30) days before the date of the election at which the initial nominee was nominated to stand or (ii) in the case of persons nominated by the Board of Directors, the substitute nominee must be designated not less than thirty (30) days before the date of the election at which the initial nominee was nominated to stand.
If the chairman of the meeting for the election of Directors determines that a nomination of any candidate for election as a Director at such meeting was not made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 11, such nomination shall be void; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11 shall be deemed to limit any voting rights upon the occurrence of dividend arrearages, provided to holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Preferred Stock designation for any series of Preferred Stock.

Exhibit 99.1
SAN JOSE, California, and LEUVEN, Belgium  February 21, 2008  KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) and ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV (Euronext: IVIS) today jointly announced an agreement under which KLA-Tencor will make a friendly tender offer to acquire ICOS in a cash transaction valued at 36.50 per share. KLA-Tencor is the leading supplier of inspection and metrology systems to the global semiconductor industry; ICOS is a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the semiconductor industry, and has a market leadership position in the inspection of photovoltaic solar technologies and LED lighting products.
The transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2008 and is subject to the following closing conditions: (a) the acceptance of the offer by holders of at least 85% of ICOS's outstanding shares, (b) ICOS not having distributed any new dividend to its shareholders prior to completion of the bid, (c) the bid must not be subject to review by any governmental authority regulating antitrust, competition or merger control matters in any jurisdiction beyond the initial phase of review for the applicable jurisdiction, and (d) the absence of any material adverse change with respect to ICOS. The board of directors of ICOS has confirmed that it will issue a favorable opinion on the bid (subject to the filing by KLA-Tencor with the Belgian "Commissie voor het Bank-, Financie- en Assurantiewezen/Commission bancaire, financire et des assurances" of a final prospectus compliant with all applicable requirements) and that any board members holding ICOS shares will tender their shares in the offer.
The net transaction value (excluding treasury shares and net of cash) is 316.9 million (approximately $465.8 million). The transaction value represents a 35% premium to the average closing price of ICOS's shares over the preceding 90-days. In addition, as part of the bid, KLA-Tencor will offer to purchase at the bid price, under certain circumstances, the ICOS shares underlying all outstanding 2002 employee stock options and 2007 employee warrants. KLA-Tencor expects for the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first year.
"ICOS has exceptional synergy with KLA-Tencor in both markets and technologies, and would provide us with additional opportunities for both growth and diversification," said Rick Wallace, CEO of KLA-Tencor. "Our two companies serve adjacent markets and offer complementary technologies, making this a good fit for both parties, and we believe that ICOS's growth potential will be even greater as part of KLA-Tencor. This acquisition would give KLA-Tencor a significant presence in semiconductor packaging inspection, as well as in fast-growing markets like solar and LED lighting, setting the stage for ongoing growth outside KLA-Tencor's primary market in semiconductor fab operations."
ICOS's primary business is the design and manufacture of inspection equipment for semiconductor packaging and interconnect applications.

On May 2, 2008, KLA-Tencor Corporation ("KLA-Tencor") issued $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.900% senior notes due 2018 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 2, 2008 between KLA-Tencor and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"). A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Indenture.
The Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.900% per annum. Interest on the Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2008. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2018.
KLA-Tencor may redeem all or part of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. The make-whole premium is calculated as the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled interest payments on the Notes at the time of re demption, discounted at a rate equal to the yield to maturity of a comparable treasury security plus 50 basis points.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes may require KLA-Tencor to purchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture generally defines "Change of Control Triggering Event" as the combination of (i) a change of control of KLA-Tencor and (ii) a downgrade or withdrawal of the Notes' rating by two or more of the three rating agencies that rate the Notes during the period commencing on the date that KLA-Tencor announces the occurrence of or its intention to effect a change of control, and ending on the date that is 60 days after the consummation of such change of control.
The Indenture contains covenants restricting KLA-Tencor's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur secured indebted ness and to engage in sale-leaseback transactions, subject to certain exceptions.
The Notes will be unsecured and will rank equally in right of payment with all of KLA-Tencor's future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of KLA-Tencor's subsidiaries and will be effectively subordinated to any of KLA-Tencor's future secured indebtedness and to all future indebtedness and other liabilities of KLA-Tencor's subsidiaries.
The Indenture contains additional customary terms and covenants, including provisions under which if certain events of default occur and are continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
SECTION 104.
Acts of Holders; Record Dates
.
     
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing, and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
     
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signatory acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
     
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
     
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series,
provided
,
however
, that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;
provided
,
however
, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
13
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the
Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of
referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;
provided
,
however
, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
     
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day;
provided
,
however
, that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
     
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
SECTION 105.
Notices, Etc
., to Trustee and Company.
     
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
14
     
(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or
     
(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
     
Except as otherwise expressly provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, where this Indenture or any Security provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
SECTION 107.
Conflict with Trust Indenture Act
.
     
If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act or deemed to be a part of and govern this Indenture, such required or deemed provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.
SECTION 108.
Effect of Headings and Table of Contents

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
15
     
All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
     
In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
     
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
     
This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (including without limitation Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law or any successor to such statute). The Trustee and the Company agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan, in The City of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Indenture or the Securities.
     
The Trustee and the Company hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive any rights they may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation based hereon, or arising out of, under or in connection with this Indenture or any course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether oral or written) or actions of the Trustee or the Company relating thereto. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has received full and sufficient consideration for this provision and that this provision is a material inducement for the Trustee and the Holders entering into this Indenture.
     
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of any Security which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity; and no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, if payment is made on the next succeeding Business Day.

Securities issued in global form shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (including the Global Security Legend thereon and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security" attached thereto). Securities issued in definitive form, if any, shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (but without the Global Security Legend thereon and without the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security" attached thereto) and shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by a combination of these methods on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the Officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Each Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities from
17
time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 203 hereof.
SECTION 202.
Execution and Authentication
.
     
An Officer of the Company shall sign the Securities for the Company, by manual or facsimile signature.
     
If the Officer of the Company whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time such Security is authenticated, such Security shall be valid nevertheless.
     
A Security shall not be valid or obligatory, or entitled to any benefit under this Indenture, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authentication Agent manually or by facsimile. The signature of the Trustee on such certificate upon such Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
     
The Trustee, upon a Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver Securities for original issue in an aggregate principal amount specified in such order. Such Company Order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated. The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
     
If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
     
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
     
(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such
18
Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 306, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
     
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with Holders or an Affiliate of the Company.

Except as otherwise provided above in this Section 203(a), every Security authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 203 or Section 302 or 304 hereof, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security.

At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security or for Definitive Securities, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depository at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security, such other Global Security shall be increased accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depository at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase.

(iii) The Security Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange any Security selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
     
The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution and, subject to Section 202, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officer's Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series,
     
(1) the title of the Securities of the series (which shall distinguish the Securities of the series from Securities of any other series);
24
     
(2) any limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the series which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities of the series pursuant to Section 302, 303, 304, 906 or 1107 and except for any Securities which, pursuant to Section 202, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder);
     
(3) the date or dates on which the principal of any Securities of the series is payable;
     
(4) the rate or rates at which any Securities of the series shall bear interest, the date or dates from which any such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which any such interest shall be payable and the Regular Record Date for any such interest payable on any Interest Payment Date;
     
(5) the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on any Securities of the series shall be payable;
     
(6) the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which any Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company and, if other than by a Board Resolution, the manner in which any election by the Company to redeem the Securities shall be evidenced; and
     
(7) any other terms of the series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, except as permitted by Section 901(9)).
     
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 202) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officer's Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
     
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officer's Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.
     
Pending the preparation of Definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and, upon receipt of Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
25
     
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause Definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for Definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more Definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
SECTION 303.
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
.
     
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or agency and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
SECTION 304.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
.
     
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
     
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
     
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 305.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
.
     
Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, or on the next succeeding Business Day as provided in Section 113 (herein called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
     
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
     
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
     
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, repurchase, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed in accordance with the Trustee's then customary procedures. If requested by the Company, certification of the disposition of all cancelled Securities shall be delivered to the Company.
     
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated in Section 301, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and/or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" and/or such other numbers in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders;
provided
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be
28
affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" and/or such other numbers.
SECTION 401.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
.
     
As to all Outstanding Securities of any series, this Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for) and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture when:
29
     
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under this Indenture by the Company with respect to the Securities of such series; and
     
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent under this Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with.
     
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Outstanding Securities of any series, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
     
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
     
Each of the following constitutes an "Event of Default" with respect to Securities of any series (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
     
(a) the failure to pay interest on any Security of such series when the same becomes due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 days;
     
(b) the failure to pay the principal (or premium if any) of any Security of such series, when such principal becomes due and payable, at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, upon redemption or otherwise (including the failure to make a payment to purchase Securities of such series tendered pursuant to a Change of Control Offer);
30
     
(c) a default in the performance, or breach, of the obligations of the Company under Section 801 of this Indenture;
     
(d) a default in the observance or performance of any other covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture which default continues for a period of 60 days after the Company receives written notice specifying the default (and demanding that such default be remedied) from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the Outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series;
     
(e) (i) a failure by the Company to make any payment, at the stated maturity, on any Indebtedness of the Company (other than Indebtedness owing to any of its Subsidiaries) in an amount in excess of $75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time outstanding under or evidenced by any single indenture or instrument, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, and such failure shall have continued after any applicable grace period or (ii) a Default on any Indebtedness of the Company (other than Indebtedness owing to any of its Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which Default results in such Indebtedness being accelerated or otherwise declared due and payable prior to the stated maturity thereof in an amount in excess of $75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, without such Indebtedness having been discharged or the acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled;
provided
,
however
, that if any failure, Default or acceleration referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) ceases or is cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default shall be deemed cured;
     
(g) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
     
(i) is for relief in an involuntary case against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company;
     
(ii) appoints a custodian or receiver of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property of any of the foregoing;
31
SECTION 502.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
.
     
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 501(f) or 501(g)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), which notice shall specify the respective Event of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration" and upon any such declaration such aggregate principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(f) or 501(g) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of that series shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
     
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration;
     
(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, if interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal (and premium, if any), which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid;
     
(4) the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its expenses, disbursements and advances; and
     
(5) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default of the type described in Section 501(f) or 501(g), the Trustee shall have received an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel that such Event of Default has been cured or waived.
     
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
32
SECTION 503.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
.
     
(1) Default is made in the payment of any interest on a Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such Default continues for a period of 30 days, or
     
(2) Default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) a Security of any series at the Maturity thereof,
and such Default is continuing, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series, the whole amount then due and payable on Securities of such series for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium, if any, and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in Securities of such series, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
     
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
SECTION 504.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607) allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
33
     
No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding;
provided
,
however
, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
SECTION 505.
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities
.

SECTION 506.
Application of Money Collected
.

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee (including any predecessor Trustee) under Section 607;
     
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and
     
THIRD: To the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
     
The Trustee may fix a record date for the payment of any amounts to Holders pursuant to this Section.
     
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
34
     
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
SECTION 508.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest
.
     
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of a Security of any series shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 509.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies
.
     
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 511.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver
.
     
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities of any series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
     
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series,
provided
,
however
, that
     
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;
     
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any existing or past Default or Event of Default under this Indenture, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Securities of such series. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
36
     
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act;
provided
,
however
, that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.
SECTION 515.
Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws
.
     
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 601.
Certain Duties and Responsibilities
.
     
(1) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities,
     
(A) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     
(B) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture, but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 102, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
     
(2) In case an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise with respect to the Securities of such series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the
37
same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
     
(3) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that
     
(A) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsections (1) and (4) of this Section;
     
(B) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     
(C) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series.
     
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     
(5) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
     
If a Default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such Default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act;
provided
,
however
, that in the case of any Default of the character specified in Section 501(d) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.

provided
,
however
, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes.

SECTION 1003.
Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless
such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any Default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
     
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any series of Securities or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     
Subject to applicable abandoned property laws, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided
,
however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in New York, New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

(5) Liens to secure any extension, renewal, refinancing or refunding (or successive extensions, renewals, refinancings or refundings), in whole or in part, of any Indebtedness secured by Liens referred to in this Section 1006, so long as such Lien is limited to all or part of substantially the same property which secured the Lien extended, renewed or replaced, and the amount of Indebtedness secured is not increased (other than by the amount equal to any costs and expenses (including any premiums, fees or penalties) incurred in connection with any extension, renewal, refinancing or refunding);

(1) the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, could have incurred Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Principal Property involved in such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Securities, under Section 1006 hereto; or
     
(2) the proceeds of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction are at least equal to the fair market value of the affected Principal Property (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) and the Company applies an amount equal to the net proceeds of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction within 365 days of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction to any of (or a combination of):

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities of a series, the Company shall cause a notice to be mailed to Holders of Securities of such series, with a copy to the Trustee for the Securities of such series, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities of such series on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by such Securities and described in such notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of such series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

(5) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In the event that such third party terminates or defaults its Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to make a Change of Control Offer treating the date of such terminating or default as though it were the date of the Change of Control Triggering Event.
     
(6) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

SECTION 1103.
Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed

provided
,
however
, that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
     
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
     
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in a denomination of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
     
(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and
(6) the CUSIP and/or other similar number as contemplated by Section 308.

SECTION 1105.
Deposit of Redemption Price

On or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
SECTION 1106.
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
.
     
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price ) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price;
provided
,
however
, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Interest Payment Dates are on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 305.
     
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
SECTION 1107.
Securities Redeemed in Part
.
     
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and Stated Maturity, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

Company's Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
.

SECTION 1202.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge
.
     
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 1201 hereof to have this Section 1202 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
     
(1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1204 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due;
     
(2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 302, 303, 304, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to the Trustee, including but not limited to those under Section 607;
61
     
Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option to have this Section applied to Securities of any series notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option to have Section 1203 applied to such Securities.
     
Upon the Company's exercise of its option under Section 1201 hereof to have this Section 1203 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1001 through 1008, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 901(7) or 901(9) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(d) (with respect to any of Sections 1001 through 1008, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 901(7) or 901(9)) shall be deemed not to be or result in a Default or an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(d)), whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise of its option under Section 1201 hereof to have this Section 1203 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 1204, Sections 501(c) and (d) shall not constitute Events of Default.
SECTION 1204.

The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1202 or Section 1203 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:

62
     
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that:
     
(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or
     
(b) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law,
     
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
     
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
     
(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and the grant of any Lien securing such borrowings);

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with; and
     
(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, assuming no intervening bankruptcy of the Company between the date of deposit and the 91st day following the date of deposit and that no Holder of such Securities is an insider of the Company, after the 91st day following the date of deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by clause (2) above with respect to a Legal Defeasance need not be delivered if all such Securities not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable or (ii) will become due and payable on the Stated Maturity within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1206, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1204 in respect of Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 1204 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series.
     
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 1204 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
     
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to Securities of any series by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1202 or 1203 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1205 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article;

        In its acceptance of Ms. Urbanek's decision not to stand for re-election, the Board expressed its gratitude and appreciation to Ms. Urbanek for her 17 years of service to the Company.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") and various current and former directors and officers of the Company were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed on June 29, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Two similar actions were filed later in the same court, and all three cases were consolidated into one action, in which a consolidated complaint alleged claims under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 14(a), Section 20(a), and Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting, seeking unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The Company and all other defendants filed motions to dismiss these cases in June 2007. Before the motions to dismiss were decided, however, the parties agreed to settle the litigation under terms including a payment by the Company of $65.0 million for the benefit of the settlement class.
Following notice, the Court approved the settlement at a hearing on September 26, 2008, certified a settlement class consisting of all persons who acquired KLA-Tencor securities from June 30, 2001 through January 29, 2007 (except for defendants, certain related persons, and those persons who requested to be excluded from the settlement class), and entered a final judgment dismissing the litigation with prejudice and providing a full release of KLA-Tencor and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations raised in the lawsuit by the plaintiffs and all members of the settlement class.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MILPITAS, Calif.October 30, 2008KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended on September 30, 2008. KLA-Tencor reported GAAP net income of $19 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.11 on revenue of $533 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
"Macro-economic uncertainty, declining consumer demand, and limited access to financing are having an adverse impact on semiconductor capital equipment spending across all end markets and geographies. In response to sharp order declines and uncertain outlook, we are implementing actions to reduce costs, while still maintaining our strategic focus and strengthening KLA-Tencor's competitive position, and to lay the foundation for growth once the business environment improves," commented Rick Wallace, chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "Our market leadership, the exceptional value of our technology and our strong balance sheet provide us with the resources to maintain a high level of customer focus during this downturn."
 
 
A reconciliation between GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, restatement and restructuring related items.

Item 2.05.    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On November 18, 2008, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company"), in response to current market conditions, announced a plan to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15 percent by June 30, 2009. This reduction is one of many cost-reduction actions the Company is taking in an effort to lower the Company's quarterly operating expense run rate to approximately $165-170 million by the end of fiscal year 2009 in response to the current demand environment.
The Company currently estimates that, in connection with the workforce reduction, it will incur an initial charge in the range of approximately $15 million to $20 million, almost all of which is related to estimated severance costs associated with the workforce reduction. Substantially all of that charge will result in future cash expenditures, which the Company believes will be paid out in fiscal year 2009. The Company anticipates incurring additional restructuring charges, severance costs and other related expenses in connection with the workforce redu ction at least through the remainder of fiscal year 2009 but is unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such additional charges at this time.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company on November 18, 2008 announcing the planned workforce reduction is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)        The Company's employees, including its executive officers, are generally eligible to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Historically, the Company's ESPP offered employees a 24-month offering period with exercise periods every six months. The purchase price was 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company's common stock ("FMV") at the commencement of the offering period (which could be as much as 24 months prior to the purchase date) or (ii) the FMV on the purchase date (typically, June 30 or December 31) (commonly referred to as a "look-back").
On November 13, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors, as permitted by Section 4 of the ESPP plan document and as part of the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce operating expenses, authorized the Company to reduce each offering period under the ESPP (and therefore the look-back period) from 24 months to six months. This change will be effective January 1, 2009, such that each offering period beginning on or after such date will have a duration of six months, and the purchase price with respect to each such offering period will be 85% of the lesser of (i) the FMV at the commencement of the six-month offering period or (ii) the FMV on the purchase date.

MILPITAS, Calif.-Nov. 18, 2008-KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) announced today that, in response to current market conditions, the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15 percent by June 30, 2009. This reduction is one of many cost-reduction actions the company is taking in an effort to lower the company's quarterly operating expense run rate to approximately $165-170 million by the end of fiscal year 2009 in response to the current demand environment.
"Our employees are the heart of our organization, so it is with considerable reluctance that we are proceeding with this necessary reduction," said Rick Wallace, chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "We will continue to monitor the demand environment and make the necessary adjustments to weather this downturn, help optimize our profitability, maintain our strategic focus and strengthen our competitive position."
KLA-Tencor currently estimates that, in connection with the workforce reduction, it will incur an initial charge in the range of approximately $15 million to $20 million, almost all of which is related to estimated severance costs associated with the workforce reduction.  Substantially all of that charge will result in future cash expenditures, which KLA-Tencor believes will be paid out in fiscal year 2009.  KLA-Tencor anticipates incurring additional restructuring charges, severance costs and other related expenses in connection with the workforce reduction at least through the remainder of fiscal year 2009 but is unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such additional charges at this time.

Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 12, 2009, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing revisions to the Company's previously issued financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended December 31, 2008, reflecting further deterioration of the condition of the semiconductor and related industries.
In the press release, the Company also announced that it is in the process of conducting its annual evaluation of the value of its goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. Based on the result to date of the Company's continuing evaluation, the Company currently anticipates incurring a material non-cash impairment charge on certain of its goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company also expects that, in addition to the impairment charge described in the preceding sentence, its financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 will reflect an increase in inventory reserves (driven by declines in the Company's product build plans and s ervice inventory usage) and an increase in reserves for potential losses relating to heightened risk of non-payment of accounts receivable as certain customers face financial difficulty. The actual amounts of such impairment charge and reserve increases will be communicated along with the announcement of the Company's results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

MILPITAS, Calif.-January 12, 2009-KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today revised its previously issued financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended December 31, 2008, reflecting further deterioration of the condition of the semiconductor and related industries.
"
Global economic uncertainty, weak consumer demand, and turbulent financial markets have led our customers to scale back production operations and reduce capital expenditures. Business conditions in our markets have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, leading to unanticipated shortfall in quarterly new orders, revenues and earnings for KLA-Tencor, with weak services revenue a key contributing factor to that result," commented Rick Wallace, president and CEO of KLA-Tencor. "We cannot predict the severity or duration of this economic downturn. In light of these conditions, we recently announced actions we are taking that are intended to optimize our cost structure and lower our break-even level, while maintaining our strategic focus and strong financial position. We will continue to evaluate further cost savings as conditions merit."
KLA-Tencor now expects that its performance for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 will be as follows:
-- New Bookings: $235 - $245 million - -- Revenue: $390 - $400 million
KLA-Tencor is in the process of conducting its annual evaluation of the value of its goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. Based on the result to date of the company's continuing evaluation, KLA-Tencor currently anticipates incurring a material non-cash impairment charge on certain of its goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. KLA-Tencor is unable to provide an estimate of its GAAP or Non-GAAP earnings per share until the completion of the ongoing evaluation of the value of its goodwill and intangible assets, but expects that it will report a loss from operations for the quarter, even before taking into account the impairment charge described above.
KLA-Tencor expects that the loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, in addition to being impacted by lower revenues, will reflect (1) as noted above, a material non-cash charge resulting from the impairment of the company's goodwill and intangible assets, (2) an increase in inventory reserves, driven by declines in KLA-Tencor's product build plans and service inventory usage, and (3) an increase in reserves for potential losses relating to heightened risk of non-payment of accounts receivable as certain customers face financial difficulty. The actual amounts of such impairment charge and reserve increases will be communicated along with the announcement of KLA-Tencor's results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
KLA-Tencor today also announced that the company will provide a live webcast of its upcoming second quarter fiscal 2009 earnings call, scheduled for Thursday, January 29, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. (PST). The webcast will be available on KLA-Tencor's We bsite at , on the Investors page.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MILPITAS, Calif. (Jan. 29, 2009)KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its second quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended on December 31, 2008. KLA-Tencor reported a GAAP net loss of $434 million and a GAAP loss per share of $2.57 on revenues of $397 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 include the pre-tax impact of a $435 million charge related to the aggregate impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. KLA-Tencor reported a non-GAAP net loss of $20 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.12 for the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
"The continuing worldwide economic slowdown drove sharp reductions in our customers' capital budgets, and KLA-Tencor experienced a greater-than-expected decline in orders and revenue at the end of the December quarter, including service revenue," said Rick Wallace, president and chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "In light of the current economic environment and our limited visibility regarding future market conditions, KLA-Tencor has been taking aggressive steps to reduce operating expenses and drive structural efficiencies across our organization, while maintaining a high level of investment in research and development, as well as our focus on customer service. We are confident these actions will allow us to sustain our technological and market leadership during this severe downturn and position us well when industry conditions improve, while protecting our balance sheet."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, restatement, and restructuring related items.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)        In its meeting held on February 19, 2009, the independent members of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") to modify language that previously determined, upon certain termination events, certain performance-based cash and equity benefits based upon a participant's target awards for the year of termination. The amendments to the Severance Plan now base such payments and acceleration upon the actual amounts that would have been earned for the year of termination, had the participant remained in the employment of the Company through the entire year, and therefore such benefits will not be calculated or delivered to the participant until after the completion of the applicable performance period(s) and the final determination of the Company's (and, as applicable, the participant's) satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria.< p>Specifically, the material amendments to the Severance Plan were as follows:
--        A revised definition of "Average Annual Incentive" and the addition of a defined term "Termination Year Bonus" to provide that, with respect to a plan participant who, as of the date of his or her separation from service with the Company, has not been an employee of the Company for at least the then-prior three full fiscal years, such participant's "Average Annual Incentive" will be equal to an annualized calculation of the participant's average annual incentive cash compensation over his or her prior full fiscal years of service and for the fiscal year in which the separation occurs, with the latter amount calculated (based on the Company's actual performance metrics for such fiscal year) after the conclusion of such fiscal year as if the participant had remained as an employee of the Company through the requisite service period to qualify for such payment and pro-rated to refle ct the portion of the fiscal year of termination that the participant served as an employee of the Company. The prior definition of "Average Annual Incentive" provided that such a participant would be entitled to his or her full target bonus for the fiscal year in which the separation from service occurs.
--        Modifications to Sections 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d) of the Severance Plan to specify that the number of shares subject to any performance-based equity award for which vesting is to be accelerated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan will only be calculated following the determination of the extent to which the performance criteria have actually been satisfied (if at all).
--        Inclusion of procedural provisions (a) to clarify the timing of payments of a participant's average annual incentive in the event such amount is not known at the time the participant's separation payments b egin and (b) to provide that the Company will, in connection with a participant's separation from service, amend such participant's equity award agreements to the extent necessary to give effect to the equity acceleration provisions of the Severance Plan.
--        Addition of the defined term "Prior Completed Fiscal Years" and the use of such term in the Severance Plan to clarify which prior years of service will be included in the determination of certain benefits.
The preceding description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated Severance Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.51 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On February 19, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's By-Laws, effective immediately. The amendment and restatement implemented the changes described below to Section 7 of Article I and Section 11 of Article II of the Company's By-Laws:
1.        The amended By-Laws clarify that the advance notice provisions set forth in Section 7 of Article I relate to business to be properly requested by a stockholder to be brought before a stockholder meeting other than business relating to the nomination or election of directors, which is governed exclusively by Section 11 of Article II.
2.        The amended By-Laws clarify that, to properly bring any matter before a stockholder meeting, a stockholder must (a) be a stockholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is proposed, only if such beneficial owner was the benefici al owner of shares of the Company) both at the time of giving notice provided for in the By-Laws and at the time of the meeting, (b) be entitled to vote at the meeting and (c) comply with the applicable notice procedures set forth in the By-Laws.
3.        The amended By-Laws modify the advance notice deadlines in Section 7(a)(iii) of Article I and Section 11(a)(ii) of Article II establishing when a stockholder must notify the Company that such stockholder intends to nominate directors or propose other business at an annual meeting of stockholders. The amended By-Laws now provide that any such notice must be given (other than in the exceptional cases specified in the By-Laws) not later than the close of business on the 90th day, and not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. As a result of the amendments, for the Company's 2009 annual meeting, to be timely, a stockholder's notice m ust be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Company:
--        not earlier than the close of business on July 16, 2009; and
--        not later than the close of business on August 15, 2009.
        Notwithstanding the deadlines described above, if the Company did not hold an annual meeting in the previous year or the date of the Company's annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to the annual meeting and (B) the 10th day following the date on which public an nouncement of the date of the meeting is first made.
4.        The amended By-Laws clarify that stockholders seeking to nominate directors or propose other business at a meeting must comply with the advance notice provisions in Section 7 of Article I or Section 11 of Article II, as applicable, while stockholders seeking to have a stockholder proposal considered for inclusion in the Company's annual proxy statement must comply with the notice requirements applicable to stockholder proposals under the federal proxy rules.
5.        The amended By-Laws add advance notice deadlines in Section 11(b)(ii) of Article II establishing when a stockholder must notify the Company that it intends to nominate directors in the event that a special meeting of stockholders is called for the purpose of electing directors. To be timely, the amended By-Laws require that any such notice be given not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting.
6.        The amended By-Laws update the information that must be included in a notice under Section 7(a) of Article I or Section 11(a) or 11(b) of Article II. Among other things, the amendments require a stockholder that intends to propose a nomination or other business to provide information about any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to the nomination or other business to be proposed that has the effect or intent of mitigating loss, managing risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of shares of the Company, or increasing or decreasing voting power with respect to shares of the Company, including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares. In addition, a stockholder proponent must disclose identification and shareholding information with respect to beneficial owners of shares of stock of the Company owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder, as well as all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and any other person with respect to business being proposed or nominations for directors. The amended By-Laws further require that the stockholder provide the Company with a written update of certain of the information required to be included in the notice within five business days after the record date for the meeting.
7.        The amended By-Laws provide that, if a stockholder fails to timely deliver the updated information required by the advance notice provisions or if a stockholder (or its qualified representative) fails to appear at the stockholder meeting to present the business described in the stockholder's notice, the stockholder's proposed b usiness will not be transacted at the meeting.
8.        The amended By-Laws provide guidance in Sections 7(a)(v) of Article I and Sections 11(a)(iv) and 11(b)(iii) of Article II regarding the persons that stockholders may designate to represent them at an annual or special meeting. Previously, the By-Laws did not include that guidance.
In addition, the amended By-Laws (a) eliminate the requirement that the Company's annual stockholder meeting be held within 13 months of the date of the preceding year's annual stockholder meeting, (b) extend to the Company's officers designated for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the authority to vote and otherwise act on behalf of the Company with respect to exercising the Company's rights as a shareholder of any other entity, and (c) make certain other updates and clarifications to internal cross-references and language (none of which have a substantive effect on the amended provisions).
The prece ding description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by an inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting.

Section 8.
Conduct of Business
. At any meeting of the Board of Directors, business shall be transacted in such order and manner as the Board may from time to time determine, and all matters shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the directors present, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.

At the request of the Board of Directors or the chairman of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director will furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee and such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person will be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation at a special meeting of the stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11(b).
     
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11(b), unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses B(2) and C(1) through C(3) of Section 11(a)(iii) above to the Corporation within five business days following the record date for a special meeting of stockholders or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the special meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Section 1.
Right to Indemnification
. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative ("proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or a person of whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said Law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and amounts expended in seeking indemnification granted to such person under applicable law, this by-law or any agreement with the Corporation) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
provided however,
that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Such right shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
provided
,
however
, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law then so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 1 or otherwise.
     
Section 2.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
. If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within twenty (20) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     
Section 3.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The rights conferred on any person in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 5.
Insurance
. The Corporation shall maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
     
Section 6.
Effect of Amendment
. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VIII by the stockholders or the Directors of the Corporation shall

Section 7.
Savings Clause
. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by an applicable portion of this Article VIII that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
     
The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws of the Corporation.

(c)
Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason During the Change of Control Period

The Company will amend the agreements (e.g., restricted stock unit agreements or stock option agreements) underlying a Participant's equity awards outstanding as of the date of such Participant's Separation from Service to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Section 4(c).
     
(d)
Certain Terminations Prior to a Change of Control
. If at any time during the period beginning with the execution of a definitive agreement to effect a Change of Control and ending with the earlier (x) the termination of that agreement without a Change of Control or (y) the effective date of the Change of Control contemplated by that agreement, the Participant incurs a Separation from Service because his or her service as an Employee is reduced or terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, then each of his or her outstanding equity awards, whether vested or unvested, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the documents evidencing those awards, remain outstanding for a period of six (6) months following such Separation from Service (or, if earlier, until the expiration date of the maximum term (not to exceed ten years) of
such award). Should the Change of Control contemplated by that agreement become effective during that six (6)-month period, then, subject to Sections 3(a) and 5, Participant shall thereupon become entitled to the following benefits: (i) the unvested portion of each of his or her outstanding equity awards shall vest immediately (provided that, with respect to any award for which satisfaction of the performance criteria applicable to such award has not yet been determined as of the date of such Participant's Separation from Service, the number of shares under such award that shall be accelerated for purposes of this clause (i) shall only be equal to the final number of shares under such award, as calculated following the determination of the extent to which such performance criteria have actually been satisfied (if at all)); (ii) each of his or her New Options/SARs shall have an extended post-termination exercise period equal to the earlier of (x) twelve (12) months from the date of his or her cessation of Employee status or (y) the expiration date of the maximum term (not to exceed ten years) of such New Option/SAR; (iii) a cash amount equal to the Participant's Severance Multiple multiplied by the sum of the Participant's Base Salary and Average Annual Incentive, payable in successive equal installments over the Severance Period in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies for salaried employees, with the first such payment to begin on the first payday within the sixty (60)-day period following the date of his or her Separation from Service on which the Participant's Required Release is effective, but in no event shall such initial payment be made later than the last business day of such sixty (60)-day period on which the Release is so effective (provided that, if the Average Annual Incentive component of such payment cannot be calculated prior to the date of such initial payment (for example, because the Company's Compensation Committee has not certified the extent to which the applicable performance criteria have been achieved), the Average Annual Incentive amount will, once it can be calculated, be paid in successive equal installments over the then-remaining term of the Severance Period in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies for salaried employees (or, if the Severance Period has ended, in lump-sum on the first payday after such calculation has been completed)); (iv) the Participant's Prorated Annual Incentive, with such payment to be made in a lump sum at the same time as the first installment payment under clause (iii) above and (v) a monthly payment of $2,000 for the duration of the Severance Period, with the payment for each such month to be made concurrently with the first payment made under clause (iii) above for that month. The severance benefits payable under this Section 4(d) shall be in lieu of any severance benefits to which the Participant might otherwise be entitled under Section 4(c); accordingly, there shall be no duplication of benefits under Sections 4(c) and 4(d).

To the extent the Participant vests in any outstanding restricted stock unit award or other similar full value equity award in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b), 4(c) or 4 (d), the
underlying shares of the Company's common stock shall be issued on the date that award vests upon the satisfaction of the applicable requirements for such vesting (including the Release requirements under Section 3(a)) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following such vesting date. The Participant's right to receive shares of the Company's common stock in one or more installments under such equity awards shall, for purposes of Code Section 409A, be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments.
If the benefits provided to the Participant under this Plan or otherwise payable to him or her (a) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, (b) would be subject to the Excise Tax, and (c) the aggregate present value of those parachute payments, as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, is less than the dollar amount obtained by first multiplying the Participant's "base amount" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(3)) by three (3) and then adding to such product fifty thousand dollars, then such benefits shall be reduced to the extent necessary (but only to that extent) so that no portion of such benefits will be subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Such reduction shall be effected first by reducing the dollar amount of the Participant's cash severance payments under clause (i) of Section 4(b), clauses (i) and (v) of Section 4(c) or clauses (iii) and (v) of Section 4(d), as applicable, with such reduction to be applied pro-rata to each such payment without any change in the payment dates, then by reducing his or her lump sum Pro-rated Annual Incentive payment and finally by reducing the accelerated vesting of his or her outstanding equity awards. All calculations required under this Section 4(f)(i) shall be performed by an independent registered public accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Company and the Participant (the "Independent Auditors"). The initial calculations shall be completed within thirty (30) business days following the effective date of the Change of Control, and any additional calculations required in connection with the Participant's subsequent Separation from Service shall be completed within thirty (30) business days following the date of such Separation from Service.
     
(ii)
Parachute Payments Equal to or Greater than 3x Base Amount Plus Fifty Thousand Dollars
. If the benefits provided to the Participant under this Plan or otherwise payable to him or her (a) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, (b) would be subject to the Excise Tax, and (c) the aggregate present value of those parachute payments, as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, equals or exceeds the dollar amount obtained by first multiplying the Participant's "base amount" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(3)) by three (3) and then adding to such product fifty thousand dollars, then (A) those benefits shall be delivered in full to the Participant, and (B) the Participant shall also receive (1) a payment from the Company sufficient to pay such Excise Tax and (2) an additional payment from the Company sufficient to pay the federal and state income and employment taxes and additional Excise Taxes arising from the
payments made to the Participant by the Company pursuant to this clause (B), with such combined payment herein designated the "Tax Gross-Up."
     
(iii)
280G Determinations
. Within thirty (30) days after any Change of Control transaction in which one or more of the benefits paid or provided to the Participant constitute, in the opinion of the Independent Auditors, parachute payments under Code Section 280G which equal or exceed the dollar amount calculated under subparagraph (ii) of this Section 4(f), the Independent Auditors shall calculate the Excise Tax attributable to those payments and the resulting Tax Gross-Up to which the Participant is entitled with respect to such tax liability. Within thirty (30) days after the Participant's Separation from Service under Section 4(c) or 4(d), the Independent Auditors shall identify any additional parachute payments which such Participant is to receive pursuant to this Plan in connection with such Separation from Service and submit to the Company and the Participant the calculation of the Excise Tax attributable to those payments and the resulting Tax Gross-Up to which the Participant is entitled with respect to such tax liability. In each such instance, the Company will pay the applicable Tax Gross-Up to the Participant (net of all applicable withholding taxes, including any taxes required to be withheld under Code Section 4999) within ten (10) business days following the later of (i) the delivery by the Independent Auditors of the calculation of the applicable Excise Tax and the resulting Tax Gross-Up, provided such calculations represent a reasonable interpretation of the applicable law and regulations or (ii) the date the related Excise Tax is remitted to the appropriate tax authorities. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 4(f), the Independent Auditors may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish the Independent Auditors with such information and documents as the Independent Auditors may reasonably request in order to make the calculations required under this Section 4(f). The Company shall bear all costs the Independent Auditors may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 4(f).
     
(iv) In the event that the Participant's actual Excise Tax liability is determined by a Final Determination (as defined below) to be greater than the Excise Tax liability taken into account for purposes of the Tax Gross-Up paid to the Participant pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 4(f), then within thirty (30) days following the Final Determination, the Participant shall submit to the Company a new Excise Tax calculation based upon that Final Determination. The Independent Auditors shall, within the next forty-five (45) days thereafter, calculate (in accordance with the same procedures applicable to the calculation of the initial Tax Gross-Up payment hereunder) the additional Tax Gross-Up payment to which the Participant is entitled on the basis of the Excise Tax liability resulting from that Final Determination and deliver those calculations to the Company and the Participant. The Company shall make such additional Tax Gross Up payment to the Participant within ten (10) business days following the later of (i) the delivery of the applicable calculations or (ii) the date the excess tax liability attributable to the Final Determination is remitted to the appropriate tax authorities.
     
(v) In the event that the Participant's actual Excise Tax liability is determined by a Final Determination to be less than the Excise Tax liability taken into account for purposes of the Tax Gross-Up paid to the Participant pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 4(f), then the Participant shall refund to the Company, promptly upon receipt, any federal or state tax refund attributable to the Excise Tax overpayment.
     
(vi) For purposes of this Section 4(f), a "Final Determination" means an audit adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service that is either (i) agreed to by both the Participant (or his or her estate) and the Company (such agreement by the Company to be not unreasonably withheld) or (ii) sustained by a court of competent jurisdiction in a decision with which the Participant and the Company concur (such concurrence by the Company to be not unreasonably withheld) or with respect to which the period within which an appeal may be filed has lapsed without a notice of appeal being filed.

(ii) In no event shall any Tax Gross-Up to which the Participant becomes entitled pursuant to Section 4(f) be made later than the

The following special provisions shall govern the commencement date of the payments and benefits to which a Participant may become entitled under the Plan:
     
(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary (other than Section 6(b) below), no payment or benefit under the Plan which constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and becomes payable by reason of the Participant's Separation from Service will be made to such Participant prior to the
earlier
of (i) the first day following the six-month anniversary of the date of Separation of Service or (ii) the date of the Participant's death, if the Participant is deemed at the time of such Separation from Service to be a Specified Employee and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period, all payments, benefits and reimbursements deferred pursuant to this Section 6(a) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) shall be paid or provided to the Participant in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the date of his or her Separation from Service or, if earlier, the first day of the month immediately following the date the Company receives proof of his or her death. Any remaining payments or benefits due under the Plan will be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified herein.
     
(b) Notwithstanding Section 6(a) above, the following provisions shall also be applicable to a Participant who is a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Separation of Service:
     
(i) Any payments or benefits under the Plan which become due and payable to such Participant during the period beginning with the date of his or her Separation from Service and ending on March 15 of the following calendar year shall not be subject to the six (6)-month holdback under Subsection 6.A and shall accordingly be paid as and when they become due and payable under the Plan.
     
(ii) The remaining portion of the payments and benefits to which the Participant becomes entitled under the Plan, to the extent they do not in the aggregate exceed the dollar limit described below and are otherwise scheduled to be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant's Separation from Service occurs, shall not be subject to any deferred commencement date under Section 6(a) and shall be paid to the Participant as they become due and payable under the Plan. For purposes of this subparagraph (ii), the applicable dollar limitation will be equal to two times the
lesser
of (i) the Participant's annualized compensation (based on his or her annual rate of pay for the calendar year preceding the calendar year of his or her Separation from Service, adjusted to reflect any increase during that calendar year which was expected to continue indefinitely had such Separation from Service not occurred) or (ii) the compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as in effect
in the year of such Separation from Service. To the extent the portion of the severance payments and benefits to which the Participant would otherwise be entitled under the Plan during the deferral period under Section 6(a) exceeds the foregoing dollar limitation and the amount payable pursuant to subparagraph (i) above, such excess shall be paid in a lump sum upon the expiration of that deferral period, in accordance with the payment delay provisions of Section 6(a), and the remaining severance payments and benefits (if any) shall be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
impose on the Participant or the Company any obligation to retain the Participant as an Employee, to change the status of the Participant's employment, or to change the Company's policies regarding termination of employment. The Participant's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law. If the Participant's employment with the Company or a successor entity terminates for any reason, the Participant shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Plan or available in accordance with the Company's established employee plans and practices or other agreements with the Company at the time of termination.

The Company and the Participant shall each bear their own respective costs and attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration; and the Company shall pay the arbitrator's fees, unless law applicable at the time of the arbitration hearing requires otherwise.

(d)
No Impermissible Acceleration or Deferral
. Any action by the Committee to terminate the Plan or amend the Plan in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 shall be effected in a manner so as not to result in any impermissible acceleration or deferral of benefits under Code Section 409A or the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

[  ]   Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [  ]   Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
Item 2.05.    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On March 30, 2009, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company"), in continuation of its efforts to control costs and in response to depressed market conditions, announced that it will reduce the Company's global workforce by approximately 10 percent. This reduction is in addition to the workforce reduction that the Company announced in November 2008. The reduction is one of many cost-saving actions being undertaken by the Company that are designed to help reduce the Company's quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to a range of $140-145 million per quarter by the end of calendar year 2009.
In addition to the workforce reduction announced today, the Company announced that it will also implement a number of other cost-cutting actions over the next several quarters, including the consolidation of several of the Company's facilities.
The Company currently estimates that, in connection with the cost reduction actions announced today, it will incur charges in the range of approximately $20 million to $30 million, i ncluding approximately $18 million to $22 million related to estimated severance costs associated with the workforce reduction, with the remainder of such charges related to facilities consolidation. A significant portion of these restructuring charges will be recorded in the Company's fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. The Company estimates that the restructuring measures announced today will result in approximately $18 million to $22 million in cash payments (reflecting the estimated severance costs associated with the restructuring), which the Company believes will be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009. The remainder will be a non-cash accounting-related charge associated with facilities consolidations.
The Company anticipates incurring additional restructuring charges, which will likely include severance costs, lease termination charges, other exit costs associated with facility site consolidations or closures, and other related expenses in connection with the cost reduction actions announ ced today through the remainder of calendar year 2009, but is unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such additional charges at this time. If the Company incurs additional charges in connection with these cost reduction actions, the Company would file an amended report on Form 8-K under this Item 2.05 to provide appropriate estimates related to such additional charges.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company on March 30, 2009 announcing the planned restructuring and other cost reduction actions is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
In addition, in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2008, the Company originally estimated that the initial charges that it would incur in connection with the workforce reduction announced on such date (the "November Action") would be in the range of approximately $15 million to $20 million. The Company has determined that, as a result of additional charges related to the November Action that were incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2009, the Company's updated estimate for the charges associated with the November Action is in the range of approximately $20 million to $25 million, almost all of which is related to estimated severance costs associated with the November Action. Substantially all of those charges have resulted, or will result, in cash expenditures, which the Company believes will all be paid out in fiscal year 2009.
Statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K and in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto other than historical facts, such as statements regarding the anticipated size of the Company's reduction in its workforce, the expected timing of the implementation of the Company's cost reduction activities, the estimated costs associated with such activities, the anticipated benefits that such activities will have on the Company's operating results and competitive position, the Company's expected level of operating expe nses in future periods, the Company's implementation of additional cost reduction activities in the future, the Company's future market position and the impact that the present cost reduction efforts could have on the Company's ability to preserve its competitive position, the Company's ability to continue to improve its technologies, the Company's future research and development efforts, and future customer demand for the Company's products are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to those associated with costs and delays related to compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws, including notification procedures required thereby; the Comp any's ability to consolidate its facilities on favorable terms, including sales terms with respect to any properties that may be sold and lease termination costs with respect to any leased properties; future developments in the semiconductor industry, capital markets and the global economy; the effectiveness of the Company's other efforts to reduce its operating expenses; demand for the Company's products; the results of the Company's product development efforts; disruption from the workforce reduction and its potential impact on research and development efforts and the Company's relationships with customers and vendors; the introduction of new products by the Company's competitors; acceptance of the Company's products by its customers; and other similar factors. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K and in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, please refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein). The Company cannot provide any assurance that its future results will meet expectations, and the Company disclaims any obligation to update information contained in any forward-looking statement.
 
 
Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)        The Company's employees, including its executive officers, are generally eligible to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP").
Under the ESPP as currently in effect, the purchase price for shares of the Company's common stock acquired by participants under the ESPP is 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company's common stock ("FMV") at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the FMV on the purchase date (typically, June 30 or December 31). The FMV of the Company's Common Stock is defined as the closing price of the Company's Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the applicable date.
On March 27, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors, as part of the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce operating expenses, approved amendments to the ESPP that (a) eliminate the look-back feature (i.e., the reference to the FMV at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period) and (b) reduce the purchase price discount from 15% to 5%. These changes will be effective July 1, 2009, such that the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date will be 95% of the FMV on the purchase date.
The foregoing description of the changes to the ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended ESPP, which is attached as Exhibit 10.52 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The Board, in its discretion, from time to time, may, prior to an Enrollment Date for all options to be granted on such Enrollment Date, determine (on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis) the Employees who will or will not be eligible to participate in the Plan consistent with Section 423(b)(4) of the Code.
Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the grant, such Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or (ii) which permits such Employee's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds US$25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.

5. PARTICIPATION
An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions on the form provided by the Company and filing it with the Company's Plan administrator (or its designate) during the open enrollment period prior to the applicable Enrollment Date, unless a later time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the Board for all eligible Employees with respect to a given Offering Period.
Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on the first payroll date following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll date in the Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.
6. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
At the time a participant files his subscription agreement, he shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each pay date during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Compensation which he receives on each pay date during the Offering Period, and the aggregate of such payroll deductions during the Offering Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of his aggregate Compensation during said Offering Period. If the Board determines that payroll deductions are not feasible in a particular country outside the United States, the Board may permit an eligible participant to participate in the Plan by an alternative means, such as by check; however, the rate of contributions may not exceed any whole number percentage (as determined by the Board) of the participant's aggregate Compensation up to ten percent (10%) (or such greater percentage, as specified by the Board) to apply to an Offering Period.
All payroll deductions made by a participant shall be credited to his account under the Plan. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account, except as provided under Section 6(a).
The deduction rate so authorized shall continue in effect for the entire Offering Period, unless the participant shall reduce such rate by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator (or its designate). The reduced rate shall become effective as soon as practicable following the filing of such form.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) herein, the Company may automatically decrease a participant's payroll deductions to zero percent (0%) at such time during any Offering Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year. Payroll deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such participant's subscription agreement at the beginning of the first Offering Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.
7. GRANT OF OPTION
On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an option to purchase on the applicable Exercise Date for the Offering Period (at the per share option price) up to a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock determined by dividing such Employee's payroll deductions accumulated during such Offering Period by ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Exercise Date, provided that the number of shares subject to the option shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the number of shares determined by dividing ten percent (10%) of the Employee's Compensation over the Offering Period by ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Enrollment Date, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof. The Board may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that an eligible Employee may purchase during each Offering Period. Fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 7(b) herein.
The option price per share of the shares offered in a given Offering Period shall be ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on the applicable Exercise Date. The option price per share may be determined for subsequent Offering Periods by the Board subject to compliance with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule) or pursuant to Section 19. The fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on a given date shall be determined by the Board in its discretion; provided, however, that where there is a public market for the Common Stock, the fair market value per share shall be the closing price of the Common Stock for such date, as reported by the Nasdaq National Market. If a closing price is not available for an Enrollment Date or an Exercise Date, the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on such date shall be the fair market value of a shar e of the Common Stock of the Company on the last business day prior to such date.
8. EXERCISE OF OPTION
Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to his option will be purchased for him at the applicable option price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his account. During his lifetime, a participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him. Any amount remaining in the participant's account after an Exercise Date shall be refunded to the participant.
9. DELIVERY
As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares (or electronic delivery of such shares) purchased upon exercise of his option.
10. WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
A participant may withdraw all but not less than all of the payroll deductions credited to his account under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company. All of the participant's payroll deductions credited to his account will be paid to him as soon as practicable after receipt of his notice of withdrawal and his participation in the Plan will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for the purchase of shares will be made. Payroll deductions will not resume on behalf of a participant who has withdrawn from the Plan unless written notice is delivered to the Company within the open enrollment period preceding the commencement of an Offering Period directing the Company to resume payroll deductions.
Upon termination of the participant's Continuous Status as an Employee prior to the Exercise Date of an Offering Period for any reason, including retirement or death, the payroll deductions credited to the participant's account will be returned to the participant or, in the case of death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14, and such participant's option will be automatically terminated.
If an Employee fails to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee for at least 20 hours per week during an Offering Period in which the Employee is a participant, he will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to his account will be returned to him and his option terminated.
A participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon his eligibility to participate in a succeeding Offering Period or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.
11. INTEREST
No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a participant in the Plan.
12. STOCK
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which shall be made available for sale under the Plan as of November 17, 1998 shall be 1,200,000, increased on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company beginning on and after July 1, 1999 by a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2,000,000 shares, or (ii) the number of shares which the Company estimates (based on the previous 12-month period) it will be required to issue under the Plan during the forthcoming fiscal year. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, shares issuable under the Plan shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of the Company's Common Stock or any combination thereof. If on a given Exercise Date the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining availab le for option grant in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable. In such event, the Company shall give written notice of such reduction of the number of shares subject to the option to each Employee affected thereby and shall similarly reduce the rate of payroll deductions, if necessary.
The participant will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by his option until such option has been exercised.
Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and his or her spouse.
13. ADMINISTRATION
The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee appointed by the Board. The Board may delegate routine matters to management. The administration, interpretation or application of the Plan by the Board, its committee or their respective delegates shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all participants.
Members of the Board who are eligible Employees are permitted to participate in the Plan, provided that:
Members of the Board who are eligible to participate in the Plan may not vote on any matter affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of any option pursuant to the Plan.
If a committee is established to administer the Plan, no member of the Board who is eligible to participate in the Plan may be a member of the committee.
14. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY (FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY)
The provisions of this Section 14 apply only to participants in the United States:
A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to the end of the Offering Period but prior to delivery to him of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death prior to the exercise of the option.
Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the participant at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
15. TRANSFERABILITY
Neither payroll deductions credited to a participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 10.
16. USE OF FUNDS
All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions (unless otherwise required by local law).
17. REPORTS
Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees semi-annually promptly following each Exercise Date, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares purchased and the refunds, if any.
18. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION
Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised (including the increase set forth in Section 12 hereof) and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but have not yet been placed under option (collectively, the
"Reserves"), as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the Common Stock) or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Comm on Stock subject to an option.
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another entity, the Board, in its sole discretion, may provide that (i) each option under the Plan shall be assumed, (ii) an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor entity or a parent or subsidiary of such successor entity, or in lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the participant shall have the right to exercise the option, including shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable, or (iii) the Plan shall terminate and a shortened Offering Period will take place with a purchase occurring on a date determined by the Board or a participant's contributions returned.
The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole discretion, also make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, if the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or other increases or decreases of the shares of its outstanding Common Stock, and if the Company is being consolidated with or merged into any other corporation.
19. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
The Board may at any time terminate or amend the Plan. No such termination can affect options previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any participant, nor may an amendment be made without prior approval of the stockholders of the Company if such amendment is required by law or otherwise to be approved by the stockholders.
Amendments to the Code which impact the Plan shall be automatically implemented without further action by the Board unless such amendments require independent action by either the Board or the stockholders.
In the event the Board determines that the ongoing operation of the Plan may result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences to the Company, the Board may in any manner it determines, in its sole discretion, and, to the extent necessary or desirable, modify or amend the Plan to reduce or eliminate such accounting consequence including, but not limited to altering the purchase price for any Offering Period including an Offering Period underway at the time of the change in purchase price. Such modifications or amendments shall not require stockholder approval or the consent of any Plan participants.
20. NOTICES
All notices or other communications by a participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
21. STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL
Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within 12 months before or after the date the Plan is adopted. If such stockholder approval is obtained at a duly held stockholders meeting, it may be obtained by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company present or represented and entitled to vote thereon, which approval shall be:
(a) (i) solicited substantially in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
(ii) solicited after the Company has furnished in writing to the holders entitled to vote substantially the same information concerning the Plan as that which would be required by the rules and regulations in effect under Section 14(a) of the Act at the time such information is furnished; and
(b) obtained at or prior to the first annual meeting of stockholders held subsequent to the first registration of Common Stock under Section 12 of the Act.
In the case of approval by written consent, it must be obtained by the unanimous written consent of all stockholders of the Company.
22. CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES
Shares shall not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.
23. RULES FOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Board may adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding the definition of Compensation, handling of payroll deductions, making of contributions to the Plan in forms other than payroll deductions, establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold payroll deductions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, withholding procedures and delivery of shares which vary with local requirements.

MILPITAS, Calif.-March 30, 2009-KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) announced today that, in continuation of its efforts to control costs and in response to depressed market conditions, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 10 percent. This reduction is in addition to the company's workforce reduction that was announced in November 2008. The reduction is one of many cost-saving actions being undertaken by KLA-Tencor that are designed to help reduce the company's quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to a range of $140-145 million per quarter by the end of calendar year 2009, adjusted from the company's previously announced target of $165-170 million per quarter.
"Although we have been successful in our efforts to reduce operating costs in late 2008 and early 2009, we must now further reduce our operating expenses in order to respond to the current demand environment," said Rick Wallace, chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "Today's reduction in force is an extremely difficult decision as we realize the effect this action will have on both impacted and remaining employees."
In addition to the workforce reduction being announced today, the company will also implement a number of other cost-cutting actions over the next several quarters, including the consolidation of several of the company's facilities, additional forced time off and a reduction in employee stock purchase plan benefits. However, KLA-Tencor is steadfast in its commitment to maintain a healthy research and development program and sustain its strategic business focus. The company remains committed to continuing to innovate process control technology for customers and optimizing efficiencies throughout the organization, which KLA-Tencor believes will continue to solidify its market leadership position and ability to provide superior process control technologies to its customers.
KLA-Tencor currently estimates that, in connection with the cost-reduction activities announced today, it will incur charges in the range of approximately $20 million to $30 million, including approximately $18 million to $22 million related to estimated severance costs associated with the workforce reduction, with the remainder of such charges related to facilities consolidation. A significant portion of these restructuring charges will be recorded in KLA-Tencor's fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. KLA-Tencor estimates that the restructuring measures announced today will result in approximately $18 million to $22 million in cash payments (reflecting the estimated severance costs associated with the restructuring), which KLA-Tencor believes will be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009.  The remainder will be a non-cash accounting-related charge associated with facilities consolidations.
The company anticipates incurring additional restructuring charges, which will likely include severance costs, lease termination charges, other exit costs associated with facility site consolidations or closures, and other related expenses in connection with the cost reduction actions announced today through the remainder of calendar year 2009, but is unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such additional charges at this time.
Forward Looking Statements:

Amendment to 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
On October 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to Section 3 of the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") so that such section now provides that (a) shares of the Company's common stock ("Shares") that are withheld by the Company in satisfaction of applicable withholding taxes upon the issuance, vesting or settlement of equity awards under the Plan will, going forward, no longer be available for future issuance under the Plan and (b) upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right settled in Shares, the gross number of shares covered by the portion of the stock appreciation right award so exercised (and not merely the net number of Shares actually issued upon such exercise) will cease to be available under the Plan.
At the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on November 4, 2009, the Company's stockholders will have the opportunity to vote whether to approve the amended and restated Plan, as amended as described above, and its material terms.

Shares used to pay the exercise or issue price for the Shares subject to an Option or other Award shall become available for future issuance under the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Common Stock, such cash payment shall not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Shares withheld by the Company in satisfaction of the applicable withholding taxes upon the issuance, vesting or settlement of Awards shall not be available for future issuance under the Plan.
4. .
Administration of the Plan
(a) .
Procedure
(i) . The Plan may be administered by different Committees with respect to different groups of Service Providers.
Multiple Administrative Bodies
(ii) . To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Options or other Awards granted hereunder as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Section 162(m)
(iii) . To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured so as to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.
Rule 16b-3
(iv) . Other than as provided above, the Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which committee shall be constituted so as to satisfy Applicable Laws.
Other Administration
(b) . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion:
Powers of the Administrator
(i) to determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in accordance with Section 2(t) of the Plan;
(ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;
(iii) to determine when and to what extent Awards or any combination thereof are to be granted hereunder;
(iv) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent units to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;
(v) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
(vi) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options or SARs may be exercised or other Awards vest (which may be based on performance criteria), the issue dates for the Shares underlying such Awards (other than Options or SARs), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
(vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;
(viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;
(ix) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 20(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options and SARs longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;
(x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
(xi) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of an Award that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, rounded up to the nearest whole Share (but no more). The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (or, if such tax determination date is not a market trading day, then the Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the market trading day immediately prior to such tax determination date). All elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable. The Administrator may also structure one or more such Awards so that a portion of the underlying Shares will automatically be withheld to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes upon the issuance, vesting or settlement of those Awards;
(xii) to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards; and
(xiii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
(c) . The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.

No Employment Rights
7. .
Code Section 162(m) Provisions
(a) . No Participant shall be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to purchase more than 400,000 Shares in the aggregate; provided, however, that such limit shall be increased to 1,200,000 Shares for the Fiscal Year in which the Participant commences Service Provider status.

Performance Units Annual Limit
(d) . For purposes of qualifying Awards of Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or Deferred Stock Units as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or Deferred Stock Units to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or Deferred Stock Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of that Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in setting the Performance Goals and in subsequently certifying the attainment of those goals). No performance vesting requirements used to qualify such Awards as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code may be waived by the Administrator, except in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's Service Provider status or as otherwise provided in Section 18(c).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions

Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Notice of Grant.
Term
(b) . The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Administrator and shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
Option Exercise Price
(c) . The exercise price for an Option may not be reduced without the consent of the Company's stockholders. This shall include, without limitation, a repricing of the Option as well as an Option exchange program whereby the Participant agrees to cancel an existing Option in exchange for an Option, SAR or other Award under the Plan.
No Repricing
(d) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. In so doing, the Administrator may specify that an Option may not be exercised until the completion of a service period or until performance milestones are satisfied.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(e) . The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Subject to Applicable Laws, such consideration may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
(i) cash;
(ii) check;
(iii) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an Option, have been owned by the Participant for the period (if any) necessary to avoid any resulting charge to the Company's earnings for financial accounting purposes and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;
(iv) a broker-dealer sale and remittance program pursuant to which the Participant shall (A) provide instructions (either in writing or electronically) to a Company designated brokerage firm (or, with respect to Participants subject to Section 16(b), a broker reasonably satisfactory to the Company for purposes of administering such procedure in accordance with the Company's pre-clearance/pre-notification policies) to effect the immediate sale of some or all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company on the settlement date sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased Shares and any applicable withholding taxes and (B) shall provide directives (either in writing or electronically) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm on the settlement date in order to complete the sale transaction;
(v) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(vi) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(f) . Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Option Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Exercise of Option; Rights as a Stockholder
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, unless the sale and remittance procedure under Section 9(e)(iv) is utilized. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Shares covered by the Option, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 18 of the Plan. Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(g) . If a Participant terminates Service Provider status, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of such termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination of Service Provider status. If, on the date of such termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after termination of Service Provider status, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by the vested Option shall revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(h) . If a Participant terminates Service Provider status as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of such termination
Disability
(but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination of Service Provider status by reason of Disability. If, on the date of such termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after termination of Service Provider status, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by the vested Option shall revert to the Plan.
(i) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
(j) The Administrator may include in the Award Agreement for one or more Option grants made under the Plan an automatic extension provision whereby the specified post-termination exercise period in effect for each such Option shall automatically be extended by an additional period of time equal in duration to any interval within the specified post-termination exercise period during which the exercise of that Option or the immediate sale of the Shares acquired under such Option could not be effected in compliance with Applicable Laws, but in no event shall such an extension result in the continuation of any such Option beyond the expiration date of the term of that Option.
Special Extension of Exercise Period.
(k) . Each Option shall be designated in the Notice of Grant as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares subject to a Participant's Incentive Stock Options granted by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, which become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 9(k), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under Applicable Law, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time of grant.

The exercise price for the Shares or cash to be issued pursuant to an already granted SAR may not be changed without the consent of the Company's stockholders. This shall include, without limitation, a repricing of the SAR as well as an SAR exchange program whereby the Participant agrees to cancel an existing SAR in exchange for an Option, SAR or other Award under the Plan.
(c) . Upon exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
(i) the amount by which the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price; times
(ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

SAR Agreement
(f) . A SAR granted under the Plan shall expire upon the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement, but in no event shall such term exceed ten (10) years.
Expiration of SARs
(g) . If a Participant terminates Service Provider status, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her SAR within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the SAR is vested on the date of such termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the SAR shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination of Service Provider status. If, on the date of such termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire SAR, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the SAR shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after termination of Service Provider status, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her SAR within the time specified by the Administrator, the SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by the vested SAR shall revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(h) . If a Participant terminates Service Provider status as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her SAR within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the SAR is vested on the date of such termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the SAR shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination of Service Provider status by reason of Disability. If, on the date of such termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire SAR, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the SAR shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after termination of Service Provider status, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her SAR within the time specified herein, the SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by the vested SAR shall revert to the Plan.

If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such SAR may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the SAR is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the SAR shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's death. If the SAR is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such SAR shall revert to the Plan.
(j) The Administrator may include in the Award Agreement for one or more SAR Awards made under the Plan an automatic extension provision whereby the specified post-termination exercise period in effect for each such SAR Award shall automatically be extended by an additional period of time equal in duration to any interval within the specified post-termination exercise period during which the exercise of that SAR Award or the immediate sale of the Shares acquired under such Award could not be effected in compliance with Applicable Laws, but in no event shall such an extension result in the continuation of any such SAR Award beyond the expiration date of the term of that Award.

Leaves of Absence
16. .
Part-Time Service
(a) Unless the Administrator provides otherwise or except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, any service-based vesting of Awards granted hereunder (other than Performance Shares or RSUs) shall be extended on a proportionate basis in the event an Employee on a full-time schedule transitions to a work schedule under which he or she is customarily scheduled to work on less than a full-time basis, or if not on a full-time work schedule, to a schedule requiring fewer hours of service. Such vesting shall be proportionately re-adjusted prospectively in the event that the Employee subsequently becomes regularly scheduled to work additional hours of service.
(b) Unless the Administrator provides otherwise or except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, any service-based vesting of Performance Share or RSU Awards granted hereunder shall continue unchanged and unaffected in the event an Employee on a full-time schedule transitions to a work schedule under which he or she is customarily scheduled to work on less than a full-time basis, or if not on a full-time work schedule, to a schedule requiring fewer hours of service.

Non-Transferability of Awards
18. .
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Liquidation or Change of Control
(a) . The number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding Award, the number and/or class of securities available for issuance under the Plan (including shares or securities returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award), as well as the exercise or issue price per share in effect under each such outstanding Award (provided the aggregate exercise or issue price shall remain the same) and the 162(m) fiscal-year share issuance
Changes in Capitalization
limits under Sections 7(a) and (b) hereof shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to reflect any change to the Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination or reclassification, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, or any other change to the Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, and shall also be equitably and proportionally adjusted should the value of the outstanding shares of Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Compensation Committee in such manner as it deems appropriate in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Plan and the outstanding Awards, and such adjustments shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award.
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Shares subject to such Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or forfeiture provisions applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and any other vesting and issuance provisions applicable to any Award and the underlying Shares shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated.

Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) .
Change of Control
(i) . In the event of a Change of Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an economically equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to so assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change of Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be fully vested and exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
Stock Options and SARs
(ii) . In the event of a Change of Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit Award shall be assumed or an economically equivalent Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit Award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to so assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit or Deferred Stock Unit Award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit or Deferred Stock Unit Award, including as to Shares (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit and Deferred Stock Unit Award shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, that Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units and Deferred Stock Units
(iii) . The Administrator shall have the authority to structure one or more Awards under the Plan so that those Awards shall automatically vest in whole or in part immediately prior the effective date of a Change of Control transaction or upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's status as a Service Provider within a designated period following the effective date of such Change of Control, whether or not those Awards are assumed or substituted for in that Change of Control.
Automatic Vesting Acceleration
(iv) . The Administrator shall also have the authority to structure one or more Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit or Deferred Stock Unit Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) so that those Awards will automatically vest in whole or in part immediately prior the effective date of a Change of Control transaction or upon an involuntary termination of the Participant's status as a Service Provider within a designated period following the effective date of such Change of Control, even though the automatic vesting of those Awards may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m).
Section 162(m) Awards
19. . The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
20. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan; provided, however, that the Board may not materially amend the Plan without obtaining stockholder approval.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or statute) or other Applicable Laws, rules or regulations, including the requirements of any exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted. Such stockholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule or regulation.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing (or electronic format) and signed by the Participant and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
21. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of the Award or the issuance and delivery of such Shares (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
22. .
Liability of Company
(a) . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
(b) . If the Awarded Stock covered by an Award exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan without additional stockholder approval, such Award shall be void with respect to such excess Awarded Stock, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 20(b) of the Plan, and no Shares subject to any Award shall actually be issued unless and until such stockholder approval is obtained.
Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares
23. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares

KLA-Tencor Corporation
"KLA-Tencor delivered stronger-than-expected results and returned to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, led by a sharp increase in demand from foundry customers. Our results were also favorably impacted by a one-time non-operating gain and by a lower than normal tax rate," commented Rick Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor. "We announced several new products targeted at addressing our customers' next-generation wafer and reticle inspection requirements. As our customers increase their technology investments at the leading edge, we are advancing our market leadership while remaining focused on cost discipline."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, restatement, and restructuring related items.
KLA-Tencor will discuss the results for its fiscal year 2010 first quarter, along with its outlook, on a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the call will be available at:

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)        The employees of KLA Tencor Corporation (the "Company"), including its executive officers, are generally eligible to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP").
In March 2009, the Company's Board of Directors, as part of the Company's efforts to reduce operating expenses, approved amendments to the ESPP that, effective for the offering period that began on July 1, 2009, (a) eliminated the look-back feature (i.e., the reference to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock ("FMV") at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period) and (b) reduced the purchase price discount from 15% to 5%. Accordingly, for the current offering period under the ESPP (scheduled to end on December 31, 2009), the purchase price for shares of the Company's Common Stock acquired by participants under the ESPP will be 95% of the FMV of the Company's Common Stock on the purchase date (which, in the case of the current offering per iod, will be December 31, 2009). The FMV of the Company's Common Stock is defined as the closing price of the Company's Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the applicable date.
On November 4, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors, in response to recent improvements in the condition of the industries in which the Company operates, approved amendments to the ESPP that (a) reinstated the six-month look-back feature and (b) increased the purchase price discount from 5% to 15%. These changes will be effective January 1, 2010, such that the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date will be 85% of the lesser of (i) the FMV of the Company's Common Stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the FMV of the Company's Common Stock on the purchase date (typically, June 30 or December 31).
The foregoing description of the changes to the ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended ESPP, which is attache d as Exhibit 10.47 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On November 4, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share on the Company's Common Stock. Such dividend shall be payable on December 1, 2009 to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions (or other methods, to the extent permitted by the Board pursuant to Section 6(a) below). It is the Company's intention that the Plan qualify as an "Employee Stock Purchase Plan" under Section 423 of the Code. The provisions of the Plan shall, accordingly, be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of that section of the Code. The Plan will also be extended to Employees of foreign Subsidiaries subject to adjustments, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, to take into account the requirements of the local laws associated with the particular Subsidiary. These local requirements may not provide the same favorable tax consequences as are available to participants in the United States.

"COMMON STOCK" shall mean the Common Stock, $.001 par value, of the Company.

Accordingly, Compensation shall include, without limitation, salaries, commissions, bonuses and overtime. Compensation shall not include reimbursements of expenses, allowances, or any amount deemed received without the actual transfer of cash or any Company contributions or payments to any trust, fund, or plan to provide retirement, pension, profit sharing, health, welfare, death, insurance or similar benefits to or on behalf of such Participant or any other payments not specifically referenced above, except to the extent that the inclusion of any such item with respect to all Participants on a nondiscriminatory basis is specifically approved by the Board.
"CONTINUOUS STATUS AS AN EMPLOYEE" shall mean the absence of any interruption or termination of service as an Employee. Continuous Status as an Employee shall not be considered interrupted in the case of a leave of absence agreed to in writing by the Company, provided that such leave is for a period of not more than ninety (90) days or re-employment upon the expiration of such leave is guaranteed by contract or statute.
"DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES" shall mean the Subsidiaries which have been designated by the Board from time to time in its sole discretion as eligible to participate in the Plan.

3. ELIGIBILITY
Any Employee who shall be employed by the Company or one of its Designated Subsidiaries on a given Enrollment Date and who has been so employed for at least 30 consecutive days immediately prior to such date shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, subject to limitations imposed by Section 423(b) of the Code or other applicable local law. The Board, in its discretion, from time to time, may, prior to an Enrollment Date for all options to be granted on such Enrollment Date, determine (on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis) the Employees who will or will not be eligible to participate in the Plan consistent with Section 423(b)(4) of the Code.
Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the grant, such Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or (ii) which permits such Employee's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds US$25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.
4. OFFERING PERIODS
The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive Offering Periods with a new Offering Period commencing on January 1 and July 1 of each year, or as otherwise determined by the Board, until the Plan is terminated in accordance with Section 19 hereof. The Board shall have the power to change the duration of Offering Periods, not to exceed twenty-seven (27) months, with respect to future offerings without stockholder approval if such change is announced at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Offering Period to be affected.
5. PARTICIPATION
An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions on the form provided by the Company and filing it with the Company's Plan administrator (or its designate) during the open enrollment period prior to the applicable Enrollment Date, unless a later time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the Board for all eligible Employees with respect to a given Offering Period.
Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on the first payroll date following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll date in the Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.
6. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
At the time a participant files his subscription agreement, he shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each pay date during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Compensation which he receives on each pay date during the Offering Period, and the aggregate of such payroll deductions during the Offering Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of his aggregate Compensation during said Offering Period. If the Board determines that payroll deductions are not feasible in a particular country outside the United States, the Board may permit an eligible participant to participate in the Plan by an alternative means, such as by check; however, the rate of contributions may not exceed any whole number percentage (as determined by the Board) of the participant's aggregate Compensation up to ten percent (10%) (or such greater percentage, as specified by the Board) to apply to an Offering Period.
All payroll deductions made by a participant shall be credited to his account under the Plan. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account, except as provided under Section 6(a).
The deduction rate so authorized shall continue in effect for the entire Offering Period, unless the participant shall reduce such rate by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator (or its designate). The reduced rate shall become effective as soon as practicable following the filing of such form.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) herein, the Company may automatically decrease a participant's payroll deductions to zero percent (0%) at such time during any Offering Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year. Payroll deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such participant's subscription agreement at the beginning of the first Offering Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.
7. GRANT OF OPTION
On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an option to purchase on the applicable Exercise Date for the Offering Period (at the per share option price) up to a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock determined by dividing such Employee's payroll deductions accumulated during such Offering Period by eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Enrollment Date or on the Exercise Date, whichever is lower, provided that the number of shares subject to the option shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the number of shares determined by dividing ten percent (10%) of the Employee's Compensation over the Offering Period by eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Enrollment Date, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof. The Board may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that an eligible Employee may purchase during each Offering Period. Fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 7(b) herein.
The option price per share of the shares offered in a given Offering Period shall be the lower of: (i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on the Enrollment Date; or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on the applicable Exercise Date. The option price per share may be determined for subsequent Offering Periods by the Board subject to compliance with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule) or pursuant to Section 19. The fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on a given date shall be determined by the Board in its discretion; provided, however, that where there is a public market for the Common Stock, the fair market value per share shall be the closing price of the Common Stock for such date, as reported by the Nasdaq National Market. If a closing price is not available for an E nrollment Date or an Exercise Date, the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on such date shall be the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on the last business day prior to such date.
8. EXERCISE OF OPTION
Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to his option will be purchased for him at the applicable option price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his account. During his lifetime, a participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him. Any amount remaining in the participant's account after an Exercise Date shall be refunded to the participant.
9. DELIVERY
As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares (or electronic delivery of such shares) purchased upon exercise of his option.
10. WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
A participant may withdraw all but not less than all of the payroll deductions credited to his account under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company. All of the participant's payroll deductions credited to his account will be paid to him as soon as practicable after receipt of his notice of withdrawal and his participation in the Plan will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for the purchase of shares will be made. Payroll deductions will not resume on behalf of a participant who has withdrawn from the Plan unless written notice is delivered to the Company within the open enrollment period preceding the commencement of an Offering Period directing the Company to resume payroll deductions.
Upon termination of the participant's Continuous Status as an Employee prior to the Exercise Date of an Offering Period for any reason, including retirement or death, the payroll deductions credited to the participant's account will be returned to the participant or, in the case of death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14, and such participant's option will be automatically terminated.
If an Employee fails to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee for at least 20 hours per week during an Offering Period in which the Employee is a participant, he will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to his account will be returned to him and his option terminated.
A participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon his eligibility to participate in a succeeding Offering Period or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.
11. INTEREST
No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a participant in the Plan.
12. STOCK
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which shall be made available for sale under the Plan as of November 17, 1998 shall be 1,200,000, increased on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company beginning on and after July 1, 1999 by a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2,000,000 shares, or (ii) the number of shares which the Company estimates (based on the previous 12-month period) it will be required to issue under the Plan during the forthcoming fiscal year. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, shares issuable under the Plan shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of the Company's Common Stock or any combination thereof. If on a given Exercise Date the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining availab le for option grant in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable. In such event, the Company shall give written notice of such reduction of the number of shares subject to the option to each Employee affected thereby and shall similarly reduce the rate of payroll deductions, if necessary.
The participant will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by his option until such option has been exercised.
Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and his or her spouse.
13. ADMINISTRATION
The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee appointed by the Board. The Board may delegate routine matters to management. The administration, interpretation or application of the Plan by the Board, its committee or their respective delegates shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all participants.
Members of the Board who are eligible Employees are permitted to participate in the Plan, provided that:
Members of the Board who are eligible to participate in the Plan may not vote on any matter affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of any option pursuant to the Plan.
If a committee is established to administer the Plan, no member of the Board who is eligible to participate in the Plan may be a member of the committee.
14. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY (FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY)
The provisions of this Section 14 apply only to participants in the United States:
A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to the end of the Offering Period but prior to delivery to him of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death prior to the exercise of the option.
Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the participant at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
15. TRANSFERABILITY
Neither payroll deductions credited to a participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 10.
16. USE OF FUNDS
All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions (unless otherwise required by local law).
17. REPORTS
Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees semi-annually promptly following each Exercise Date, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares purchased and the refunds, if any.
18. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION
Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised (including the increase set forth in Section 12 hereof) and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but have not yet been placed under option (collectively, the
"Reserves"), as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the Common Stock) or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Comm on Stock subject to an option.
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another entity, the Board, in its sole discretion, may provide that (i) each option under the Plan shall be assumed, (ii) an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor entity or a parent or subsidiary of such successor entity, or in lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the participant shall have the right to exercise the option, including shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable, or (iii) the Plan shall terminate and a shortened Offering Period will take place with a purchase occurring on a date determined by the Board or a participant's contributions returned.
The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole discretion, also make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, if the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or other increases or decreases of the shares of its outstanding Common Stock, and if the Company is being consolidated with or merged into any other corporation.
19. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
The Board may at any time terminate or amend the Plan. No such termination can affect options previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any participant, nor may an amendment be made without prior approval of the stockholders of the Company if such amendment is required by law or otherwise to be approved by the stockholders.
Amendments to the Code which impact the Plan shall be automatically implemented without further action by the Board unless such amendments require independent action by either the Board or the stockholders.
In the event the Board determines that the ongoing operation of the Plan may result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences to the Company, the Board may in any manner it determines, in its sole discretion, and, to the extent necessary or desirable, modify or amend the Plan to reduce or eliminate such accounting consequence including, but not limited to altering the purchase price for any Offering Period including an Offering Period underway at the time of the change in purchase price. Such modifications or amendments shall not require stockholder approval or the consent of any Plan participants.
20. NOTICES
All notices or other communications by a participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
21. STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL
Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within 12 months before or after the date the Plan is adopted. If such stockholder approval is obtained at a duly held stockholders meeting, it may be obtained by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company present or represented and entitled to vote thereon, which approval shall be:
(a) (i) solicited substantially in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
(ii) solicited after the Company has furnished in writing to the holders entitled to vote substantially the same information concerning the Plan as that which would be required by the rules and regulations in effect under Section 14(a) of the Act at the time such information is furnished; and
(b) obtained at or prior to the first annual meeting of stockholders held subsequent to the first registration of Common Stock under Section 12 of the Act.
In the case of approval by written consent, it must be obtained by the unanimous written consent of all stockholders of the Company.

(e)    At the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 4, 2009 (the "2009 Annual Meeting"), the stockholders of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Equity Plan").
The purposes of the 2004 Equity Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, provide additional incentive to the Company's employees, Board members and consultants, and promote the success of the Company's business. The following types of awards may be made under the 2004 Equity Plan: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units.
By approving the amendment and restatement of the Company's 2004 Equity Plan, the Company's stockholders approved the following:
--        An increase in the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock authorized for issuance over the term of the 2004 Equity Plan by an additional 11,000,000 shares - from 21,000,000 to 32,000,000 shares;
--        Reapproval of the material terms of the 2004 Equity Plan, including the list of corporate performance goals through which certain awards made under the plan may be earned in order to qualify those awards as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and
--        An amendment to Section 3 of the 2004 Equity Plan so that such section now provides that (a) shares of the Company's Common Stock that are withheld by the Company in satisfaction of applicable withholding taxes upon the issuance, vesting or settlement of equity awards under the 2004 Equity Plan will, going forward, no longer be available for future issuance under the 2004 Equity Plan and (b) upon the exercise of a stock appreciation rig ht settled in shares of the Company's Common Stock, the gross number of shares covered by the portion of the stock appreciation right award so exercised (and not merely the net number of shares actually issued upon such exercise) will cease to be available under the 2004 Equity Plan.
The 2004 Equity Plan may be administered by the Company's Board of Directors or by a committee of Board members appointed by the Board.
The foregoing description of the terms of, and changes to, the 2004 Equity Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2004 Equity Plan, which was previously filed as Exhibit 10.46 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 8, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
At the 2009 Annual Meeting, the Company's stockholders also approved the material terms of the Company's Internal Revenue Code 162(m) Performance Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan").
The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to increase stockholder value and the success of the Company by motivating key executives to perform to the best of their abilities and to achieve the Company's corporate objectives. The Bonus Plan's goals provide such executives with incentive awards only after they achieve specified performance goals. Awards under the Bonus Plan are paid in cash.
By approving the material terms of the Bonus Plan, the Company's stockholders approved an expansion of the corporate performance goals to which the payment of certain awards made under the Bonus Plan may be tied in order to qualify those awards as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.
The Bonus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
The foregoing description of the terms of, and changes to, the Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bonus Plan, which was previously filed as Appendix B to the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 24, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Settlement of Derivative Litigation
As previously disclosed, shareholder derivative litigation was commenced beginning on May 22, 2006 on behalf of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the Company's historical stock option granting process and related matters. Several separate derivative actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the "Court") under the caption , Case No. C06-3445-JW (the "Derivative Litigation"). On March 15, 2010, the Company entered into a Stipulation of Settlement (the "Stipulation") to resolve the Derivative Litigation in its entirety, subject to Court approval (the "Proposed Settlement").
In re KLA-Tencor Corp. Shareholder Derivative Litigation
On March 25, 2010, the Court entered an order (the "Preliminary Order") preliminarily approving the Proposed Settlement and scheduling a hearing for consideration of final approval of the Proposed Settlement on May 24, 2010.
As set forth more fully in the Stipulation, if the Proposed Settlement is given final approval by the Court, among other things, the Company will receive cash payments totaling approximately $33.2 million from its insurers and certain of the settling defendants, the Company will pay attorneys' fees to plaintiffs' counsel in the amount of $8 million in cash, in addition to $8 million in shares of Company common stock to be issued, and the Derivative Litigation will be dismissed with prejudice. This summary of the terms of the Stipulation is qualified entirely by reference to Exhibit 99.1 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein.
The terms of the Proposed Settlement are set forth in the Stipulation, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Notice of Proposed Settlement, which contains additional information, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.
Separate Settlements with Former Executives
The Company has also entered into two separate settlements with former executives, Kenneth Schroeder (the Company's former Chief Executive Officer) and Kenneth Levy (the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board), to resolve separate claims that they asserted against the Company. As previously disclosed, Mr. Schroeder filed a lawsuit against the Company in California Superior Court asserting contract and tort claims in connection with the termination of his employment and cancellation of certain of his equity awards in October 2006, for which the Company recognized a $20.3 million benefit (in the form of reversal of previously recognized non-cash stock-based compensation charges) in the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Mr. Schroeder's lawsuit was referred to arbitration, and the Company asserted various counterclaims against him. Under the settlement, the Company will pay Mr. Schroeder $16.5 million, the parties will release and dismiss their respective claims, and the Company's ongoing obligation to indemnify and advance Mr. Schroeder's costs of defending certain litigation brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will be subject to express limitations.
Mr. Levy asserted breach of contract and tort claims against the Company for approximately $8.3 million in damages arising from the Company's alleged refusal to allow him to exercise certain of his stock options in 2007 and 2008. Under the parties' settlement of those claims, the Company will pay Mr. Levy $2.375 million, and the parties will exchange mutual releases.
The Company's settlements of these separate claims with Mr. Schroeder and Mr. Levy will become final upon the Effective Date as defined in the Proposed Settlement of the Derivative Litigation. These separate settlements do not alter, restrict or impair the parties' rights and obligations under the Proposed Settlement of the Derivative Litigation.

Counsel for Lead Plaintiff
 
This Stipulation of Settlement (the "Stipulation"), dated March 15, 2010, is made and entered into by and among the following Settling Parties (as defined further in IV.A(19) hereof), and each by and through their respective counsel: (i) Lead Plaintiff Alaska Electrical Pension Fund ("Lead Plaintiff") (on behalf of itself and derivatively on behalf of KLA-Tencor Corporation ("KLA" or the "Company")); (ii) Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert J. Boehlke, Robert T. Bond, Leo Chamberlain, Gary Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Stuart Nichols, Arthur Schnitzer, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, Lida Urbanek, Richard P. Wallace, Dennis J. Fortino and Michael E. Marks; and (iii) KLA. The Stipulation is intended by the Settling Parties to fully, finally and forever resolve, discharge and settle the Released Claims (as defined below in IV.A(15)) upon Court approval and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.
This is a shareholder derivative action (the "Action") that alleges claims based on KLA's stock option grants and related acts and practices from 1995 through 2006. The first derivative action was filed on May 22, 2006 in the United States District Court Northern District of California, San Jose Division and was styled , No. 5:06-cv-3345-JW (N.D. Cal.). Shortly thereafter, three additional actions were filed in this Court containing substantially similar allegations. On October 23, 2006, the Court issued an order (the "Consolidation Order") consolidating the federal derivative cases into the Action, appointing Alaska Electrical Pension Fund as lead plaintiff ("Lead Plaintiff") and Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as lead counsel. By resolution dated November 16, 2006, KLA's Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") and authorized it to investigate and to determine the Company's position with respect to the Action and certain State Actions containing substantially similar allegations (identified in IV.A(21)) (collectively, the "KLA Derivative Litigation").
Theodore R. Kornreich Revocable Trust v. Barnholt
On February 20, 2007, Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Complaint"). Neither KLA nor the individual defendants answered the Complaint but instead KLA requested, and Lead Plaintiff agreed to, a stipulation staying the action to allow KLA's Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") to conduct its investigation. On March 10, 2008, KLA filed a case management conference statement informing the Court that the SLC intended to file a Motion to Terminate the derivative litigation (the "Termination Motion") on March 14, 2008, and proposing a briefing schedule for the Termination Motion.
On March 25, 2008, the SLC filed its Termination Motion. The Court heard oral argument on the Termination Motion on October 6, 2008. On December 12, 2008, the Court issued an Order Denying the SLC's Termination Motion ("Termination Order"). On January 9, 2009, the SLC filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit"). The SLC appealed the Court's December 12, 2008 Termination Order, both by way of a direct appeal and a petition for mandamus. On May 8, 2009, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the SLC's direct appeal. On July 10, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied the SLC's petition for a writ of mandamus. Following the dismissal of the SLC's appeal and denial of its petition for writ of mandate to the Ninth Circuit, KLA's Board of Directors dissolved the SLC and withdrew its authority with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation.
Upon the dissolution of the SLC, in August 2009, KLA's Board of Directors appointed a Litigation Committee of the Board (the "Litigation Committee") composed of three independent directors, each of whom first became a director of KLA in 2007, after the events at issue in and filing of the KLA Derivative Litigation: (i) Robert M. Calderoni, who joined the KLA Board on March 29, 2007, (ii) John T. Dickson, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007, and (iii) Kevin J. Kennedy, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007. None of the members of the Litigation Committee was a member of KLA's former SLC. The Litigation Committee's mandate is to advise, recommend, and determine the position to be taken by the Company with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation and related matters. Since its formation, the Litigation Committee has been closely involved in the KLA Derivative Litigation, including, without limitation, the negotiations leading to the settlement reflected herein.
Between February 27, 2009 and November 19, 2009, representatives for all of the parties to the Action engaged in a formal mediation process before the Honorable Layn Phillips, U.S. District Judge (Ret.). Some or all of the parties and their insurers participated in all-day, in-person mediation sessions on February 27, 2009 in San Francisco, on March 26, 2009 in Newport Beach, California, on October 14, 2009 in New York City, and on November 19, 2009 in Palo Alto and San Francisco. Additional mediation discussions between various of the parties took place between and after the in-person mediation sessions. These mediations and settlement negotiations led to an agreement in principle among most of the parties, of which Lead Plaintiff and KLA informed the Court on January 15, 2010. Thereafter, through additional negotiations among Lead Plaintiff, the Settling Defendants, and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, the Settling Parties reached an agreement in principle for the resolution of the Action in its entirety as to all parties on the terms set forth herein.
In addition, the Litigation Committee, in its business judgment, unanimously approved the settlement and each of its terms, as set forth in this Stipulation, as in the best interest of KLA and its shareholders on March 5, 2010.
 
Lead Plaintiff and its counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Action have merit. However, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against the Settling Defendants through trial and appeal. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also are mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the violations asserted in the Action. Based on Lead Plaintiff's and its counsel's understanding of the facts, the settlement provides an excellent recovery based on the conduct of the Settling Defendants. Based on their evaluation, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of KLA and its shareholders.
 
The Settling Defendants (defined below in IV.A(18)) have denied and continue to deny each and every one of the claims and contentions alleged by the plaintiffs in the Action against them or any of them. The Settling Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them or any of them arising out of, based upon or related to any of the conduct, statements, acts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Action. Without limiting the foregoing, the Settling Defendants have denied and continue to deny that they violated the federal securities laws, violated state law, or breached their fiduciary duties or any other duty owed to KLA or its shareholders, or that KLA or its shareholders suffered any damage or harm as a result of any conduct of the Settling Defendants.
KLA and the individual Settling Defendants making payments set forth in IV.B below agree that such payments represent the repayment of compensation previously paid to each of the Settling Defendants by KLA, to which the Settling Defendants returning such compensation appeared to have an unrestricted right and to which it was established in a later year that they did not have an unrestricted right. KLA agrees to cooperate with the Settling Defendants by providing documents and information as may be requested in conjunction with their efforts to obtain appropriate treatment of the payments referred to in IV.B below.
Nonetheless, the Settling Defendants and KLA also have taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Action. The Settling Defendants and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, have each determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Action be settled in a manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.

(1) After negotiating the monetary relief for KLA and the Corporate Governance Reforms, Lead Plaintiff's Counsel and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, with the assistance of the Honorable Layn Phillips, U.S. District Judge (Ret.), negotiated the attorneys' fees and expenses the Company would pay to Plaintiffs' Counsel. The Company has agreed to pay $8,000,000 in cash (the "Cash Fee and Expense Amount"), in addition to shares of KLA common stock valued at $8,000,000 (the "Stock Award") for Plaintiffs' Counsel's attorneys' fees and expenses, subject to Court approval (collectively, the "Fee and Expense Award"). The shares constituting the Stock Award shall be fully paid, non-assessable and freely tradable as provided herein.

In the event of a merger or acquisition or sale of KLA which results in the conversion of KLA common stock to the stock of another entity before the Delivery Date, the shares constituting the Stock Award shall be converted in accordance with the same formula applicable to other common stock.
(3) The shares constituting the Stock Award shall be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 under section 3(a)(10) thereof by reason of the Court finally approving the issuance of the shares as part of the Fee and Expense Award and shall be freely tradable under the Securities Act of 1933. KLA and Lead Plaintiff's Counsel shall take any and all necessary and appropriate actions to perfect the exemption of the shares represented by the Stock Award from registration under the federal securities laws by reason of Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C.  77c(a)(10).
(4) Within five (5) business days of issuance of an Order by the Court finally approving the settlement, notwithstanding the existence of any timely filed objections to the settlement, or potential for appeal therefrom, the Company shall pay the Cash Fee and Expense Amount to Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as receiving agent for all Plaintiffs' Counsel, subject to Plaintiffs' Counsel's several obligation to make appropriate refunds or repayment of the principal amount received and any accrued interest thereon less taxes within ten (10) business days if and when, as a result of any further Order of the Court, appeal, further proceedings or remand, or successful collateral attack, the settlement is not approved or is overturned on appeal. Lead Plaintiff's Counsel shall be responsible for the allocation of the Fee and Expense Award to Plaintiffs' Counsel in the Action and the State Actions, based upon each counsel's contributions to the prosecution andor resolution of the Action and the State Actions.

Provision of such testimony shall be required, upon reasonable advance notice at a reasonable time and place, upon tender of a lawful subpoena or request to the witness or his or her counsel, provided that KLA agrees to reimburse the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses associated with such testimony, and provided further that the witness shall not be compelled to travel to deliver such testimony to an extent beyond that which could be required in the Action, absent his or her agreement to do so. This provision may be enforceable by application by KLA and/or Lead Plaintiff to the Court in the Action, either before or after entry of the Judgment.
(3) Except as expressly set forth in this Stipulation and the Exhibits hereto, the Settling Parties intend this settlement to be a final and complete resolution of all disputes between Plaintiffs and KLA and its shareholders, on the one hand, and the Released Persons, on the other hand, arising out of, based upon or related to the Released Claims.

and directors. The Company's policies and procedures with respect to executive compensation are reflected in the Compensation Committee Charter.
2. In the event of a significant restatement of financial results resulting from fraud, misconduct, material non-compliance or material errors, the Compensation Committee may (in its sole discretion, but acting in good faith and in compliance with applicable laws) direct that the Company recover all or a portion of performance-based compensation, including bonuses and long term incentive awards, made to executive officers during the restatement period. The amount to be recovered from an executive officer hereunder shall be the amount by which the performance-based compensation exceeded the amount that would have been payable to such executive officer had the financial statements been initially filed as restated, or any greater or lesser amount (including, but not limited to, the entire award) that the Compensation Committee shall determine. The Compensation Committee may determine to recover different amounts from different executive officers on such basis it shall deem appropriate. The Compensation Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the applicable executive officer, (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the executive officer under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company, (iii) by withholding (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Company's otherwise applicable compensation practices, or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing or otherwise.

Lead Counsel for Plaintiffs
 
Notice is hereby provided to you of the proposed settlement (the "Settlement") of these shareholder derivative lawsuits. This Notice is provided by Order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division (the "Court"). It is not an expression of any opinion by the Court. It is to notify you of the terms of the proposed Settlement, and your rights related thereto.
 
Your rights may be affected by the Settlement of the action styled , No. C-06-03445-JW. Lead Plaintiff, Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (on behalf of itself and derivatively on behalf of KLA), ("Lead Plaintiff"), Defendants Edward W. Barnholt ("Barnholt"), H. Raymond Bingham ("Bingham"), Robert J. Boehlke ("Boehlke"), Robert T. Bond ("Bond"), Leo Chamberlain ("Chamberlain"), Gary Dickerson ("Dickerson"), Richard J. Elkus Jr. ("Elkus"), Jeffrey L. Hall ("Hall"), Stephen P. Kaufman ("Kaufman"), John H. Kispert ("Kispert"), Kenneth Levy ("Levy"), Stuart Nichols ("Nichols"), Arthur Schnitzer, ("Schnitzer"), Kenneth L. Schroeder ("Schroeder"), Jon D. Tompkins ("Tompkins"), Lida Urbanek ("Urbanek"), Richard P. Wallace ("Wallace"), Dennis J. Fortino ("Fortino") and Michael E. Marks ("Marks") have agreed upon terms to settle the Action and have signed a written Stipulation of Settlement ("Stipulation") setting forth those settlement terms.
In re KLA-Tencor Corporation Derivative Litigation
On , 2010, at .m., the Court will hold a hearing (the "Settlement Hearing") in the Action. The purpose of the Settlement Hearing is to determine: (i) whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and should be approved; (ii) whether a final judgment should be entered; and (iii) such other matters as may be necessary or proper under the circumstances.
            
            
    
 
This is a shareholder derivative action that alleges claims based on KLA's stock option grants and related acts and practices from 1995 through 2006. The first derivative action was filed on May 22, 2006 in the United States District Court Northern District of California, San Jose Division and was styled , No. 5:06-cv-3345-JW (N.D. Cal.). Shortly thereafter, three additional actions were filed in this Court containing substantially similar allegations. On October 23, 2006, the Court issued an order (the "Consolidation Order") consolidating the federal derivative cases into the Action, appointing Alaska Electrical Pension Fund as lead plaintiff ("Lead Plaintiff") and Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as Lead Counsel. By resolution dated November 16, 2006, KLA's Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") and authorized it to investigate and to determine the Company's position with respect to the Action and certain State Actions containing substantially similar allegations (collectively, the "KLA Derivative Litigation").
Theodore R. Kornreich Revocable Trust v. Barnholt
On February 20, 2007, Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Complaint"). Neither KLA nor the individual defendants answered the Complaint but instead KLA requested, and Lead Plaintiff agreed to, a stipulation staying the action to allow KLA's SLC to conduct its investigation. On March 10, 2008, KLA filed a case management conference statement informing the Court that the SLC intended to file a Motion to Terminate the derivative litigation (the "Termination Motion") on March 14, 2008, and proposing a briefing schedule for the Termination Motion.
On March 25, 2008, the SLC filed its Termination Motion which Lead Plaintiff opposed. The Court heard oral argument on the Termination Motion on October 6, 2008. On December 12, 2008, the Court issued an Order Denying the SLC's Termination Motion ("Termination Order"). On January 9, 2009, the SLC filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit"). The SLC appealed the Court's December 12, 2008 Termination Order, both by way of a direct appeal and a petition for mandamus. On May 8, 2009, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the SLC's direct appeal. On July 10, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied the SLC's petition for a writ of mandamus. Following the dismissal of the SLC's appeal and denial of its petition for writ of mandate to the Ninth Circuit, KLA's Board of Directors dissolved the SLC and withdrew its authority with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation.
Upon the dissolution of the SLC, in August 2009, KLA's Board of Directors appointed a Litigation Committee of the Board (the "Litigation Committee") composed of three independent directors, each of whom first became directors of KLA in 2007, after the events at issue in and filing of the KLA Derivative Litigation: (i) Robert M. Calderoni, who joined the KLA Board on March 29, 2007, (ii) John T. Dickson, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007, and (iii) Kevin J. Kennedy, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007. None of the members of the Litigation Committee was a member of KLA's former SLC. The Litigation Committee's mandate is to advise, recommend, and determine the position to be taken by the Company with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation and related matters. Since its formation, the Litigation Committee has been closely involved in the KLA Derivative Litigation, including, without limitation, the negotiations leading to the settlement reflected herein.
Between February 27, 2009 and November 19, 2009, representatives for all of the parties to the Action engaged in a formal mediation process before the Honorable Layn Phillips, U.S. District Judge (Ret.). Some or all of the parties participated in all-day, in-person mediation sessions on February 27, 2009 in San Francisco, on March 26, 2009 in Newport Beach, California, on October 14, 2009 in New York City, and on November 19, 2009 in Palo Alto and San Francisco. Additional mediation discussions between various of the parties took place between and after the in-person mediation sessions. These mediations and settlement negotiations led to an agreement in principle among most of the parties, of which Lead Plaintiff and KLA informed the Court on January 15, 2010. Thereafter, through additional negotiations among Lead Plaintiff, the Settling Defendants, and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, the Settling Parties reached an agreement in principle for the resolution of the Action in its entirety as to all parties on the terms set forth herein.
In addition, the Litigation Committee, in its business judgment, unanimously approved the settlement and each of its terms, as set forth in the Stipulation, as in the best interest of KLA and its shareholders on March 5, 2010.
 
The principal terms, conditions and other matters that are part of the Settlement, which is subject to approval by the Court, are summarized below. This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Stipulation, which has been filed with the Court and is available at .com.
www.                    
To resolve the Action, the Settling Parties agree as set forth in the Stipulation as follows:
KLA and the Settling Defendants acknowledge and agree that the Action filed by Lead Plaintiff precipitated and was a material factor in the payments to KLA described below. KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, acknowledges and agrees that such payments confer a substantial benefit to KLA as part of the settlement of the Action.
: In connection with the settlement of the Action, Lead Plaintiff and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, agree that KLA has received or will receive cash payments, and certain Settling Defendants have relinquished value and/or waived certain rights, which include cash payments and the relinquishment of compensation and other benefits by certain defendants totaling $42,639,514 as follows:
Financial Benefits
1. Defendant Schroeder shall pay KLA $3,000,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
2. Defendant Levy shall pay KLA $3,000,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
3. Defendant Dickerson shall pay KLA $2,500,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
4. Defendant Tompkins shall pay the Company $502,355 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
5. Defendant Kispert shall pay KLA $200,000 in cash within five (5) business days of entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
6. Various insurance carriers shall pay KLA $24,000,000 in cash within thirty (30) business days of the entry of an order by the Court preliminarily approving the settlement;
7. Defendant Levy forfeited his rights to payment of $4,500,000 in salary, bonus, and equity awards under his employment agreement with KLA;
8. Defendants Levy, Nichols, and Kispert repriced 469,228, 55,300, and 26,325 unexercised options, respectively, thereby forfeiting options with an aggregate intrinsic value of $4,937,159. The exercise price of such options was increased so as to equal the fair market value of KLA common stock on the correct measurement date as determined by KLA in connection with the restatement; and
9. Defendant Kispert forfeited 150,000 unexercised stock options that had no intrinsic value on the date they were forfeited.
: In addition to the financial benefits, Lead Plaintiff and KLA have conducted extensive negotiations over an extended period of time regarding certain Corporate Governance Reforms related to, among other things, the composition of the Company's board of directors and committees of the board, stock option granting practices and procedures, shareholder participation in director nominations, duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee, and accounting practices and procedures. Lead Plaintiff and KLA, by and through its independent directors, believe that the corporate governance reforms provide a substantial benefit to KLA and its shareholders. The Corporate Governance Reforms are attached to the Stipulation as Appendix 1, which is available at .com.
Corporate Governance Benefits
www.                    
The Stipulation provides for the entry of judgment dismissing the Action against the Settling Defendants with prejudice and, as explained in more detail in the Stipulation, barring and releasing certain known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought in any court by the Lead Plaintiff in the Action or by KLA, or any of its shareholders, against KLA and the Settling Defendants relating to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Action. The Stipulation further provides that the entry of judgment will bar and release any known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought in any court by the Settling Defendants against Lead Plaintiff or Plaintiffs' Counsel related to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Action or based upon or arising out of the institution, prosecution, assertion, settlement, or resolution of the Action. In addition, after the Court approves the Settlement the State Actions will be dismissed with prejudice.
After substantially negotiating the monetary relief for KLA and the Corporate Governance Reforms of the Settlement, Lead Counsel and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, with the assistance of the mediator, the Honorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.), negotiated the attorneys' fees and expenses that KLA would pay to Plaintiffs' Counsel, subject to Court approval. As a result of these negotiations, and in light of the substantial benefit conferred, KLA has agreed to pay $8,000,000 in cash in addition to shares of KLA common stock valued at $8,000,000 to Plaintiffs' Counsel for their fees and expenses ("Fee and Expense Award"). The Fee and Expense Award includes fees and expenses incurred by Plaintiffs' Counsel in connection with the prosecution and settlement of the Action. To date, Plaintiffs' Counsel have not received any payments for their efforts on behalf of KLA shareholders. The Fee and Expense Award will compensate Plaintiffs' Counsel for the results achieved in the Action.
 
Counsel for the Settling Parties believe that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Settling Parties, KLA and its shareholders.
 
Lead Plaintiff and its counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Action have merit. However, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against the Settling Defendants through trial and appeal. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also are mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the violations asserted in the Action. Based on Lead Plaintiff's and its counsel's understanding of the facts, the settlement provides an excellent recovery based on the alleged conduct of the Settling Defendants. Based on their evaluation, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of KLA and its shareholders.
 
The Settling Defendants have denied, and continue to deny each and every one of the claims, contentions and allegations of liability made against them or that could have been made against them in the Action, and expressly deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them. The Settling Defendants assert that they have meritorious defenses to those claims and that judgment should be entered dismissing all claims against them with prejudice. The Settling Defendants have thus entered into the Stipulation to avoid the continuing additional expense, inconvenience, and distraction of this litigation and to avoid the risks inherent in any lawsuit, and without admitting any wrongdoing or liability whatsoever.
 
On , 2010, at .m., the Court will hold the Settlement Hearing at 2112 Robert F. Peckham Federal Building and United States Courthouse, 280 South First Street, San Jose, California. At the Settlement Hearing, the Court will consider whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and thus should be finally approved, whether the Fee and Expense Award should be approved and whether the Action should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation.

PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS NOTICE RELATES TO A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF THE ABOVE-CAPTIONED SHAREHOLDERS' DERIVATIVE ACTION (THE "ACTION") AND ACTIONS PENDING IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AND DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY (THE "STATE ACTIONS") AND CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS. YOUR RIGHTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF THE COURT APPROVES THE SETTLEMENT, YOU WILL BE FOREVER BARRED FROM CONTESTING THE APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND FROM PURSUING THE RELEASED CLAIMS.
IF YOU HOLD KLA COMMON STOCK FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER, PLEASE PROMPTLY TRANSMIT THIS DOCUMENT TO SUCH BENEFICIAL OWNER.
THE COURT HAS MADE NO FINDINGS OR DETERMINATIONS CONCERNING THE MERITS OF THE ACTION. THE RECITATION OF THE BACKGROUND AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SETTLEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE FINDINGS OF THE COURT. IT IS BASED ON REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES.
Notice is hereby provided to you of the proposed settlement (the "Settlement") of these shareholder derivative lawsuits. This Notice is provided by Order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division (the "Court"). It is not an expression of any opinion by the Court. It is to notify you of the terms of the proposed Settlement, and your rights related thereto.
 
Your rights may be affected by the Settlement of the action styled , No. C-06-03445-JW. Lead Plaintiff, Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (on behalf of itself and derivatively on behalf of KLA), ("Lead Plaintiff"), Defendants Edward W. Barnholt ("Barnholt"), H. Raymond Bingham ("Bingham"), Robert J. Boehlke ("Boehlke"), Robert T. Bond ("Bond"), Leo Chamberlain ("Chamberlain"), Gary Dickerson ("Dickerson"), Richard J. Elkus Jr. ("Elkus"), Jeffrey L. Hall ("Hall"), Stephen P. Kaufman ("Kaufman"), John H. Kispert ("Kispert"), Kenneth Levy ("Levy"), Stuart Nichols ("Nichols"), Arthur Schnitzer, ("Schnitzer"), Kenneth L. Schroeder ("Schroeder"), Jon D. Tompkins ("Tompkins"), Lida Urbanek ("Urbanek"), Richard P. Wallace ("Wallace"), Dennis J. Fortino ("Fortino") and Michael E. Marks ("Marks") have agreed upon terms to settle the Action and have signed a written Stipulation of Settlement ("Stipulation") setting forth those settlement terms.
In re KLA-Tencor Corporation Derivative Litigation
On May 24, 2010, at 9:00 a.m., the Court will hold a hearing (the "Settlement Hearing") in the Action. The purpose of the Settlement Hearing is to determine: (i) whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and should be approved; (ii) whether a final judgment should be entered; and (iii) such other matters as may be necessary or proper under the circumstances.
 
This is a shareholder derivative action that alleges claims based on KLA's stock option grants and related acts and practices from 1995 through 2006. The first derivative action was filed on May 22, 2006 in the United States District Court Northern District of California, San Jose Division and was styled , No. 5:06-cv-3345-JW (N.D. Cal.). Shortly thereafter, three additional actions were filed in this Court containing substantially similar allegations. On October 23, 2006, the Court issued an order (the "Consolidation Order") consolidating the federal derivative cases into the Action, appointing Alaska Electrical Pension Fund as lead plaintiff ("Lead Plaintiff") and Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as Lead Counsel. By resolution dated November 16, 2006, KLA's Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") and authorized it to investigate and to determine the Company's position with respect to the Action and certain State Actions containing substantially similar allegations (collectively, the "KLA Derivative Litigation").
Theodore R. Kornreich Revocable Trust v. Barnholt
On February 20, 2007, Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the "Complaint"). Neither KLA nor the individual defendants answered the Complaint but instead KLA requested, and Lead Plaintiff agreed to, a stipulation staying the action to allow KLA's SLC to conduct its investigation. On March 10, 2008, KLA filed a case management conference statement informing the Court that the SLC intended to file a Motion to Terminate the derivative litigation (the "Termination Motion") on March 14, 2008, and proposing a briefing schedule for the Termination Motion.
On March 25, 2008, the SLC filed its Termination Motion which Lead Plaintiff opposed. The Court heard oral argument on the Termination Motion on October 6, 2008. On December 12, 2008, the Court issued an Order Denying the SLC's Termination Motion ("Termination Order"). On January 9, 2009, the SLC filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit"). The SLC appealed the Court's December 12, 2008 Termination Order, both by way of a direct appeal and a petition for mandamus. On May 8, 2009, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the SLC's direct appeal. On July 10, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied the SLC's petition for a writ of mandamus. Following the dismissal of the SLC's appeal and denial of its petition for writ of mandate to the Ninth Circuit, KLA's Board of Directors dissolved the SLC and withdrew its authority with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation.
Upon the dissolution of the SLC, in August 2009, KLA's Board of Directors appointed a Litigation Committee of the Board (the "Litigation Committee") composed of three independent directors, each of whom first became directors of KLA in 2007, after the events at issue in and filing of the KLA Derivative Litigation: (i) Robert M. Calderoni, who joined the KLA Board on March 29, 2007, (ii) John T. Dickson, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007, and (iii) Kevin J. Kennedy, who joined the KLA Board on May 9, 2007. None of the members of the Litigation Committee was a member of KLA's former SLC. The Litigation Committee's mandate is to advise, recommend, and determine the position to be taken by the Company with respect to the KLA Derivative Litigation and related matters. Since its formation, the Litigation Committee has been closely involved in the KLA Derivative Litigation, including, without limitation, the negotiations leading to the settlement reflected herein.
Between February 27, 2009 and November 19, 2009, representatives for all of the parties to the Action engaged in a formal mediation process before the Honorable Layn Phillips, U.S. District Judge (Ret.). Some or all of the parties participated in all-day, in-person mediation sessions on February 27, 2009 in San Francisco, on March 26, 2009 in Newport Beach, California, on October 14, 2009 in New York City, and on November 19, 2009 in Palo Alto and San Francisco. Additional mediation discussions between various of the parties took place between and after the in-person mediation sessions. These mediations and settlement negotiations led to an agreement in principle among most of the parties, of which Lead Plaintiff and KLA informed the Court on January 15, 2010. Thereafter, through additional negotiations among Lead Plaintiff, the Settling Defendants, and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, the Settling Parties reached an agreement in principle for the resolution of the Action in its entirety as to all parties on the terms set forth herein.
In addition, the Litigation Committee, in its business judgment, unanimously approved the settlement and each of its terms, as set forth in the Stipulation, as in the best interest of KLA and its shareholders on March 5, 2010.
 
The principal terms, conditions and other matters that are part of the Settlement, which is subject to approval by the Court, are summarized below. This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Stipulation, which has been filed with the Court and is available at http://ir.kla-tencor.com/settlementnotice.cfm.
To resolve the Action, the Settling Parties agree as set forth in the Stipulation as follows:
KLA and the Settling Defendants acknowledge and agree that the Action filed by Lead Plaintiff precipitated and was a material factor in the payments to KLA described below. KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, acknowledges and agrees that such payments confer a substantial benefit to KLA as part of the settlement of the Action.
: In connection with the settlement of the Action, Lead Plaintiff and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, agree that KLA has received or will receive cash payments, and certain Settling Defendants have relinquished value and/or waived certain rights, which include cash payments and the relinquishment of compensation and other benefits by certain defendants totaling $42,639,514 as follows:
Financial Benefits
1. Defendant Schroeder shall pay KLA $3,000,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
2. Defendant Levy shall pay KLA $3,000,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
3. Defendant Dickerson shall pay KLA $2,500,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
4. Defendant Tompkins shall pay the Company $502,355 in cash within five (5) business days of the entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
5. Defendant Kispert shall pay KLA $200,000 in cash within five (5) business days of entry of an order by the Court finally approving the settlement;
6. Various insurance carriers shall pay KLA $24,000,000 in cash within thirty (30) business days of the entry of an order by the Court preliminarily approving the settlement;
7. Defendant Levy forfeited his rights to payment of $4,500,000 in salary, bonus, and equity awards under his employment agreement with KLA;
8. Defendants Levy, Nichols, and Kispert repriced 469,228, 55,300, and 26,325 unexercised options, respectively, thereby forfeiting options with an aggregate intrinsic value of $4,937,159. The exercise price of such options was increased so as to equal the fair market value of KLA common stock on the correct measurement date as determined by KLA in connection with the restatement; and
9. Defendant Kispert forfeited 150,000 unexercised stock options that had no intrinsic value on the date they were forfeited.
: In addition to the financial benefits, Lead Plaintiff and KLA have conducted extensive negotiations over an extended period of time regarding certain Corporate Governance Reforms related to, among other things, the composition of the Company's board of directors and committees of the board, stock option granting practices and procedures, shareholder participation in director nominations, duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee, and accounting practices and procedures. Lead Plaintiff and KLA, by and through its independent directors, believe that the corporate governance reforms provide a substantial benefit to KLA and its shareholders. The Corporate Governance Reforms are attached to the Stipulation as Appendix 1, which is available at http://ir.kla-tencor.com/settlementnotice.cfm.
Corporate Governance Benefits
The Stipulation provides for the entry of judgment dismissing the Action against the Settling Defendants with prejudice and, as explained in more detail in the Stipulation, barring and releasing certain known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought in any court by the Lead Plaintiff in the Action or by KLA, or any of its shareholders, against KLA and the Settling Defendants relating to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Action. The Stipulation further provides that the entry of judgment will bar and release any known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought in any court by the Settling Defendants against Lead Plaintiff or Plaintiffs' Counsel related to any of the claims or matters that were or could have been alleged or asserted in any of the pleadings or papers filed in the Action or based upon or arising out of the institution, prosecution, assertion, settlement, or resolution of the Action. In addition, after the Court approves the Settlement the State Actions will be dismissed with prejudice.
 
After substantially negotiating the monetary relief for KLA and the Corporate Governance Reforms of the Settlement, Lead Counsel and KLA, by and through its independent Litigation Committee, with the assistance of the mediator, the Honorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.), negotiated the attorneys' fees and expenses that KLA would pay to Plaintiffs' Counsel, subject to Court approval. As a result of these negotiations, and in light of the substantial benefit conferred, KLA has agreed to pay $8,000,000 in cash in addition to shares of KLA common stock valued at $8,000,000 to Plaintiffs' Counsel for their fees and expenses ("Fee and Expense Award"). The Fee and Expense Award includes fees and expenses incurred by Plaintiffs' Counsel in connection with the prosecution and settlement of the Action. To date, Plaintiffs' Counsel have not received any payments for their efforts on behalf of KLA shareholders. The Fee and Expense Award will compensate Plaintiffs' Counsel for the results achieved in the Action.
 
Counsel for the Settling Parties believe that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Settling Parties, KLA and its shareholders.
 
Lead Plaintiff and its counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Action have merit. However, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against the Settling Defendants through trial and appeal. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Lead Plaintiff and its counsel also are mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the violations asserted in the Action. Based on Lead Plaintiff's and its counsel's understanding of the facts, the settlement provides an excellent recovery based on the alleged conduct of the Settling Defendants. Based on their evaluation, Lead Plaintiff and its counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of KLA and its shareholders.
The Settling Defendants have denied, and continue to deny each and every one of the claims, contentions and allegations of liability made against them or that could have been made against them in the Action, and expressly deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them. The Settling Defendants assert that they have meritorious defenses to those claims and that judgment should be entered dismissing all claims against them with prejudice. The Settling Defendants have thus entered into the Stipulation to avoid the continuing additional expense, inconvenience, and distraction of this litigation and to avoid the risks inherent in any lawsuit, and without admitting any wrongdoing or liability whatsoever.
 
On May 24, 2010, at 9:00 a.m., the Court will hold the Settlement Hearing at 2112 Robert F. Peckham Federal Building and United States Courthouse, 280 South First Street, San Jose, California. At the Settlement Hearing, the Court will consider whether the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate and thus should be finally approved, whether the Fee and Expense Award should be approved and whether the Action should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation.

On April 29, 2010, KLA-Tencor Corporation issued a press release announcing selected operating results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended on March 31, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
MILPITAS, Calif., April 29, 2010 (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended on March 31, 2010, and reported GAAP net income of $57 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 on revenues of $478 million.
KLA-Tencor Corporation

"These results are a testament to our team's ongoing commitment to innovation and fiscal discipline. Looking forward, we believe that our leading technology will enable us to develop solutions that address our customers' most complex process control challenges, and that our improved operating efficiencies will help us drive even stronger financial performance as industry growth continues."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, restatement and restructuring related items, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and certain discrete tax items.
KLA-Tencor will discuss the results for its fiscal year 2010 third quarter, along with its outlook, on a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the call will be available at:
www.kla-tencor.com
Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding KLA-Tencor's anticipated ability to maintain its recent operating efficiencies and improve its financial performance in future periods, the company's expected capacity to maintain its technology leadership position relative to its competitors, and KLA-Tencor's ability to successfully innovate, develop and sell new technologies and products that meet customer needs are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets and the general macroeconomic environment; KLA-Tencor's ability to successfully control its future operating expenses; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technology that is responsive to customer demands; KLA-Tencor's ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that it acquires; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release, please refer to KLA-Tencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and other subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein). KLA-Tencor assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update these forward-looking statements.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our operating performance and our prospects in the future. Specifically, we believe that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

[  ]   Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [  ]   Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)        In its meeting held on November 3, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved the Company's 2010 Executive Severance Plan (the "2010 Plan"). The 2010 Plan is intended to exist in parallel with the Company's existing Executive Severance Plan (the "Existing Plan"), which will remain in full force and effect for existing participants under the Existing Plan (except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable) until terminated in accordance with its terms. No participant under the 2010 Plan is eligible to participate under the Existing Plan, and no participant under the Existing Plan is eligible to simultaneously participate under the 2010 Plan.
Like the Existing Plan, the 2010 Plan provides certain compensation and benefits in the event that a participant's employment with the Company terminates under certain defined circumstances. The terms of and benefits payable under the 2010 Plan are in many ways substantially similar to those set forth in the Existing Plan. However, unlike the Existing Plan, the 2010 Plan does not contain tax gross-up provisions related to excise taxes that may be imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as the result of a participant receiving a payment that would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G upon or in connection with a change of control of the Company. Instead, if a payment under the 2010 Plan would constitute such a "parachute payment" and would be subject to such excise tax, then such payment will be reduced to either (a) the largest portion of the payment that would result in no portion of the payment being subject to the excise tax or (b) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the excise tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the participant's receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the payment may be subject to the excise tax.
For a participant who is granted severance rights under the 2010 Plan in connection with a separation from service that is unrelated to a change of control of the Company, such participant will receive in connection with such a separation from service: (i) salary continuation payments for 18 months; (ii) pro-rated vesting of all of his or her outstanding equity awards through the date of his or her separation from service (rounded up to the next whole month and disregarding any "cliff-vesting" provisions applicable to the award); and (iii) the extension of the post-termination exercise period of each stock option or stock appreciation right granted after January 1, 2006 so that the option or right will remain exercisable for twelve months following the date of separation from service, but in no event beyond the original term of the award. The calculation in clause (ii) of this paragraph with respect to any performance-based equity awards for which the achievement of the applicable performance criteria has not yet been determined as of the participant's termination date will be delayed until the extent of the achievement of those criteria (and thus the maximum number of shares issuable under the applicable award) has been finally determined.
For a participant who is granted severance rights under the 2010 Plan in connection with a separation from service upon or in connection with a change of control of the Company, such participant will receive in connection with such a separation from service (if it occurs within one year following a change of control): (i) salary continuation payments for 18 months; (ii) a pro-rated annual incentive payment for the fiscal year of his or her separation from service (calculated based on the participant's annual inc entive bonus for the then-most recently completed fiscal year and the proportion of the then-current fiscal year served through the date of separation from service); (iii) 100% vesting acceleration of all of his or her outstanding equity awards; and (iv) the extension of the post-termination exercise period of each stock option or stock appreciation right granted after January 1, 2006 so that the option or right will remain exercisable for twelve months following the date of separation from service, but in no event beyond the original term of the award. The calculations in clause (iii) of this paragraph with respect to any performance-based equity awards for which the achievement of the applicable performance criteria has not yet been determined as of the participant's termination date will be delayed until the extent of the achievement of those criteria (and thus the maximum amounts that would have been issuable with respect to such awards) has been finally determined.
In exchange for receiving severance benefits under the 2010 Plan, the participant will be subject to a non-compete covenant and non-solicitation restrictions for the period of time co-terminous with the period for which he or she will receive continued compensation and benefits under the 2010 Plan. The 2010 Plan also contains a mitigation provision in which the benefits payable are subject to reduction to the extent the participant earns post-termination compensation from sources other than the Company.
In connection with the adoption of the 2010 Plan, the Compensation Committee also approved a modification to the severance benefits payable to Virendra A. Kirloskar, the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer and a named executive officer of the Company. Mr. Kirloskar, who previously was a participant under the Existing Plan with severance rights only in connection with a separation from service unrelated to a change of control of the Company, was removed from the Existing Plan and added as a participant under the 201 0 Plan. Under the 2010 Plan, Mr. Kirloskar has been granted severance rights under the 2010 Plan in connection with a separation from service upon or in connection with a change of control of the Company, as described two paragraphs above.
The foregoing description of the 2010 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2010 Plan, which will be attached as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2010, which the Company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or prior to February 9, 2011.
 
 
Item 5.07.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
The Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on November 3, 2010.

Two proposals were considered at the meeting.
Proposal One. The stockholders elected the Company's four Class III nominees to its Board of Directors to each serve for a three-year term, each until his or her successor is duly elected. The table below presents the results of the election.
Name                                    For                  Withheld        Broker Non-Votes

The Company's Class I directors (Robert M. Calderoni, John T. Dickson and Kevin J. Kennedy) and Class II directors (Robert P. Akins, Robert T. Bond, Kiran M. Patel and David C. Wang) were not subject to reelection at the annual meeting, and their respective terms of office as members of the Board of Directors continued after the meeting.
Consistent with the powers granted by Article II, Section 1 of the Company's Bylaws, on November 3, 2010, the Board adopted resolutions that increased, effective immediately, the number of directors on the Board from ten (10) to eleven (11) to accommodate the addition of Ms. Higashi, who was not an incumbent director prior to her election at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Proposal Two. The stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. This proposal received 152,056,169 votes in favor, 906,597 votes against and 190,211 abstentions.

Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding KLA-Tencor's ability to carry operating momentum into the quarter ending March 31, 2011, the company's ability to maintain its current market position, the expected levels of demand for process control and the company's ability to successfully innovate, develop and sell new technologies and products that meet customer needs are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations,
and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets and the general macroeconomic environment; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release, please refer to KLA-Tencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein).

current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets and the general macroeconomic environment; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release, please refer to KLA-Tencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding the ability of KLA-Tencor to maintain its technological advantages and its strong customer partnerships, as well as the company's ability to leverage those advantages and partnerships
into future successful results, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets and the general macroeconomic environment; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MILPITAS, Calif., October 27, 2011 KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended on September 30, 2011. KLA-Tencor reported GAAP net income of $192 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.13 on revenues of $796 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
"KLA-Tencor's market leadership and strong business model enabled us to deliver solid financial results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, despite a challenging global economic and industry environment," commented Rick Wallace, president and chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "Though some of our customers are delaying capacity expansion plans today as they assess current macroeconomic and industry conditions, we are well-positioned to benefit from the investments that our customers are continuing to make in driving their advanced technology roadmaps."
 
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisitions, restatement and restructuring related items, and certain discrete tax items.
KLA-Tencor will discuss the results for its fiscal year 2012 first quarter, along with its outlook, on a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the call will be available at:
www.kla-tencor.com
Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding the expectation that KLA-Tencor's customers will continue to invest in their advanced technology roadmaps and KLA-Tencor's ability to maintain its technological advantages and market position and, therefore, to benefit from those continuing investments in the form of future
successful operating results, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets and the general macroeconomic environment; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release, please refer to KLA-Tencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein). KLA-Tencor assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update these forward-looking statements.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

"Fueled by rapid growth in demand for mobile electronics, KLA-Tencor's strong third quarter results reflect sustained high levels of process control adoption and demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver indispensable solutions to our customers," said Rick Wallace, president and chief executive officer of KLA-Tencor. "As we look ahead to the second half of 2012, we are optimistic as the forces propelling KLA-Tencor's growth remain solid, and the innovation required by our customers at the leading edge is driving growth in our core process control markets."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisitions, restatement and restructuring related items, and certain discrete tax items.

Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding the anticipated future drivers of growth in the semiconductor equipment industry, KLA-Tencor's optimism regarding the future direction of those growth drivers, the need for future innovation by the company's customers at the leading edge, and KLA-Tencor's ability to benefit from these anticipated trends in demand and innovation, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including but not limited to: the demand for semiconductors; the financial condition of the global capital markets
and the general macroeconomic environment; new and enhanced product and technology offerings by competitors; cancellation of orders by customers; the ability of KLA-Tencor's research and development teams to successfully innovate and develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected and anticipated in forward-looking statements in this release, please refer to KLA-Tencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, the risk factors described therein). KLA-Tencor assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update these forward-looking statements.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
As previously announced, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") presented its annual SEMICON West analyst briefing on July 10, 2012 at the W San Francisco Hotel. The presentation was accessible via live webcast through (and a replay of the presentation is currently available on) the Investor Relations page of the Company's web site at http://ir.kla-tencor.com/, and the presentation otherwise complied with the notification, public accessibility and other requirements of Regulation FD.
During the presentation, Richard P. Wallace, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, provided updated guidance regarding certain of the Company's anticipated financial metrics for its recently completed fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended on June 30, 2012.
On April 26, 2012, in the Company's quarterly earnings conference call, the Company had provided preliminary guidance for bookings, revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share ("EPS") for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. During the July 10, 2012 SEMICON West analyst briefing, Mr. Wallace said, with respect to the Company's operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, "We finished the March quarter at about $834 million in bookings, and our guide was $775 to 950 [million] in the June quarter.   We ended up about 1% off of the March quarter, so right around $827 million in bookings." Mr. Wallace also stated that the Company's revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 were "toward the high end of the range - the range was $840 to 900 million." With respect to EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, Mr. Wallace said, "EPS we guided $1.20 to $1.38. At the guided tax rate of 26%, we would have been toward the upper end of the range. A preliminary look at the tax rate suggests that we'll actually be above the range when we finalize those results."
Mr. Wallace also provided information during the presentation regarding the Company's outlook for selected operating results in future periods. That information is available through the Regulation FD-compliant webcast that is accessible on the Company's website.
The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section.

"Global consumer demand for advanced mobile devices continued to fuel exceptional growth for KLA-Tencor in fiscal year 2012, as we delivered strong financial performance and increased the cash returned to our stockholders through our dividend program," said Rick Wallace, KLA-Tencor's president and CEO. "Looking to fiscal year 2013, we anticipate our leading-edge process control technology will increasingly be adopted by IC manufacturers worldwide to cost-effectively make smaller, more complex chips. As a market leader, we're committed to extending the limits of manufacturing technology to further advance the mobility market, enabling manufacturers to add more functionality while decreasing power consumption: a critical combination to drive the ongoing development of affordable, next-generation devices."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MILPITAS, Calif., October 25, 2012 - (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended on September 30, 2012, and reported GAAP net income of $135 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.80 on revenues of $721 million.
KLA-Tencor Corporation
"KLA-Tencor's results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 reflect today's challenging demand environment for the wafer fab equipment industry," said Rick Wallace, president and CEO. "Though macro-economic uncertainty has caused our customers to delay expansion plans, they continue to invest in leading-edge process control technologies to improve device performance and lower costs. KLA-Tencor remains focused on customer collaboration and making investments to extend our technology leadership to drive long-term growth."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisitions, restatement and restructuring related items, and certain discrete tax items.
KLA-Tencor will discuss the results for its fiscal year 2013 first quarter, along with its outlook, on a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the call will be available at:

develop technologies and products that are responsive to customer demands; market acceptance of the company's existing and newly issued products; and changing customer demands.

The Certificate Amendments were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 8, 2012 and became effective as of November 8, 2012.

In its meeting held on November 8, 2012, the independent members of the Companys Board of Directors approved identical technical amendments to the Companys Executive Severance Plan (the Original Severance Plan), a plan under which the Companys Chief Executive Officer participates. The Company does not deem the amendments to either the 2010 Severance Plan or the Original Severance Plan to be material. Specifically, the following amendments to the 2010 Severance Plan and Original Severance Plan were approved:
after the Required Release actually becomes effective, or (B) such time as otherwise required by the plan; and
The foregoing description of the amendments to the 2010 Severance Plan and the Original Severance Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2010 Severance Plan and Original Severance Plan, complete copies of which will be attached as exhibits to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2012, which the Company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or prior to February 11, 2013.

At the request of the Board of Directors or the chairman of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director will furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee and such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person will be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation at an annual meeting of the stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11(a).
(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11(a), unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses B(2) and C(1) through C(3) of Section 11(a)(iii) above to the Corporation within five business days following the record date for an annual meeting of stockholders or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 11(a), to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the proposing of the nomination at the meeting by the stockholder, stating that the person is authorized to act for the stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
(v) The chairman of the annual meeting may determine and declare, if the facts warrant, at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11(a), and in such event the defective nomination will be disregarded; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11(a) shall be deemed to limit any voting rights upon the occurrence of dividend arrearages, provided to holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Preferred Stock designation for any series of Preferred Stock.
(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder nomination for director in the Corporations proxy statement and form of proxy for an annual meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act.
(i) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11(b) will be eligible for election as directors at a special meeting of the stockholders. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, at a special meeting of the stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the notice for such meeting, only such nominations for director will be made as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, nominations must be (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise
12
properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder who (1) was a stockholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is proposed, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation) both at the time of giving notice provided for in these By-Laws and at the time of the meeting, (2) is entitled to vote at the meeting and (3) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 11(b).
(ii) In the event a special meeting is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any stockholder satisfying the requirements set forth in Section 11(b)(i)(C) above may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the notice for such meeting, if the stockholder delivers a notice satisfying the requirements set forth in Section 11(a)(iii) above to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120
th
) day prior to the special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of: (i) the ninetieth (90
th
) day prior to the special meeting or (ii) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement (as defined in Section 7(a)(iii) of Article I of these By-Laws) is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. At the request of the Board of Directors or the chairman of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director will furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee and such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person will be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation at a special meeting of the stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11(b).
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11(b), unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses B(2) and C(1) through C(3) of Section 11(a)(iii) above to the Corporation within five business days following the record date for a special meeting of stockholders or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the special meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 11(b), to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the proposing of the nomination at the meeting by the stockholder, stating that the person is authorized to act for the stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
13
(iv) The chairman of the special meeting may determine and declare, if the facts warrant, at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11(b), and in such event the defective nomination will be disregarded; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11(b) shall be deemed to limit any voting rights upon the occurrence of dividend arrearages, provided to holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Preferred Stock designation for any series of Preferred Stock.

ARTICLE VIII
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
Section 1.    
Right to Indemnification
. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative ("proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or a person of whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee, shall be indemnified
18
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said Law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and amounts expended in seeking indemnification granted to such person under applicable law, this by-law or any agreement with the Corporation) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
provided however,
that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Such right shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
provided
,
however
, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law then so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 1 or otherwise.
Section 2.    
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
. If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within twenty (20) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
19
Section 3.    
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The rights conferred on any person in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 4.    
Indemnification Contracts
. The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article VIII.
Section 5.    
Insurance
. The Corporation shall maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 6.    
Effect of Amendment
. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VIII by the stockholders or the Directors of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.
Section 7.    
Savings Clause
. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by an applicable portion of this Article VIII that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
ARTICLE IX
AMENDMENTS
The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of By-Laws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any resolution providing for adoption, amendment or repeal is presented to the Board). The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation. In the event of any such adoption, amendment or repeal
20
of these By-Laws by stockholders, in addition to any vote of the holders or any class or series of stock of this Corporation required by law or by these By-Laws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required.

MILPITAS, Calif.,
January 24, 2013
-
KLA-Tencor Corporation
(NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its
second
quarter of fiscal year
2013
, which ended on
December 31, 2012
, and reported GAAP net income of
$107 million
and GAAP earnings per diluted share of
$0.63
on revenues of
$673 million
.
"In the second quarter, KLA-Tencor delivered revenue and earnings per share at or above the upper end of our range of guidance in the face of a challenging demand environment," said Rick Wallace, president and CEO of KLA-Tencor. "We believe that the accelerated pace of innovation by our customers at the leading edge, and the essential role that process control plays in the success of that innovation, will continue to provide long-term opportunities for KLA-Tencor to advance our market leadership and to deliver superior financial performance."
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisitions, restatement and restructuring related items, and certain discrete tax items.

Forward-Looking Statements:
Statements in this press release other than historical facts, such as statements regarding market conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry, anticipated innovation efforts by customers, expected trends and focus areas in customers' capital investment, the importance of process control in the success of future innovation, KLA-Tencor's ability to preserve and extend its market leadership position and KLA-Tencor's future financial performance, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
:
The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA-Tencor's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.
To supplement KLA-Tencor's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of KLA-Tencor's operating performance and its prospects in the future. Specifically, KLA-Tencor believes that the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to KLA-Tencor's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to significant discretion. As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

On February 7, 2013, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share on the Company's Common Stock. Such dividend shall be payable on March 1, 2013 to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2013. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
In its meeting held on February 7, 2013, the Companys Board of Directors also approved a clarifying amendment to the definition of "Compensation" in Section 2(e) of the Companys Amended and Restated 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") to specify that "payments upon vesting of cash long-term incentive awards issued by the Company" are included as compensation eligible for deduction for purposes of the ESPP. Prior to this amendment, the ESPP generally provided that any amounts includable as "wages" subject to tax under Section 3101(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (which includes payments under the Company's cash long-term incentive awards), qualify as "Compensation" for purposes of the ESPP. Accordingly, the Company does not deem this amendment, which simply adds payments under cash long-term incentive awards to the illustrative list of included types of compensation, to be material.
The foregoing description of the amendment to the ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ESPP, which will be attached as an exhibit to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2013, which the Company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or prior to May 10, 2013.
